[Speaker 6]
Hey boys! Hello.

[Speaker 4]
How we doing?

[Speaker 3]
Good night. What do I want for breakfast? There's nothing I wanted, so I made a bowl of pasta.

This is what I would have had when I was fucking 15. It was good. I still ask my grandma to make me pasta for breakfast.

[Speaker 4]
I used to have cold wheat beer with way too much sugar or hundreds and thousands on them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hundreds and thousands, that's wild.

[Speaker 4]
I think we ran out of sugar once at my nan's and she was like, oh fuck, I've got to put something on there, this will do.

[Speaker 3]
And then it became a trend.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Hundreds and thousands of just fucking sugar.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I grabbed the wrong container the other day for work, for like lunch. And grabbed what I thought was butter chicken. I get to work, realise it's a fucking plate of jelly.

Jelly for lunch.

[Speaker 4]
That's fucking hilarious.

[Speaker 3]
It was so funny. All the teachers were just like, what? What the fuck is wrong with you?

Are you playing Armour?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'm just getting into retouching things up a bit.

[Speaker 5]
I'm a character shooter.

[Speaker 4]
It has been a while since I played Boundary at all.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Bloodhound doesn't translate well to Boundary, by the looks of it. You can't level up in Boundary, so I had to level up.

And then, some of the features, there's a lot of the features aren't in it. So you have to sort of... It'll copy them across, but it won't copy their programming or whatever.

Who's talking? Classic Matt Vantalite. Classic.

It's a two day hangover.

[Speaker 4]
God, two day hangover, you alright?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there you go, boom.

[Speaker 4]
The only hangover cure is not being a bitch.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Otherwise, you're just going to have to sit in it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, got it.

[Speaker 3]
Plus some modifiers too.

[Speaker 6]
I am underprepared currently, but it won't take long to catch up.

[Speaker 4]
I just need to go and get through and just pick out the new infusions and re-familiarize myself with Armour.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. We're going to make it feel like a real arsenal. That's the play.

That's always the play. He deserves it. Damn right.

It's not alright.

[Speaker 4]
You say you're going to be somewhere, you be there. I didn't even have pants on. I spent half of the first five minutes of this call putting undies and shit on.

I was in bed.

[Speaker 5]
I thought I heard something.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just banging it across my knees. It was a challenge. I've been watching Hell on Wheels and that is problematic because it meant I was up until like 2.30 last night watching Hell on Wheels.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah. It's so good.

It's basically like a historical fiction.

[Speaker 4]
It's just after the... Oh, well. It's when the Union Pacific Railroad's cutting their way across America.

And so you've got like, you've got ex-soldiers from the South who are like, oh yeah, they were slave owners. But then you've got ones from the North and it's like, oh, these are not good people. You've got the Irish being really racist against the black people.

[Speaker 6]
In fact, everyone's pretty racist against the black people. Back in the day. That's right.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Oh, look who decided to show up.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. How was your party? Or drinks?

Work drinks?

[Speaker 2]
Hello?

[Speaker 5]
Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, there we are.

[Speaker 3]
Look who showed up.

[Speaker 4]
What a cunt head.

[Speaker 3]
Made it here eventually. James is muted.

[Speaker 1]
Only for the moment. Alright. Oh, he's back.

[Speaker 4]
He was listening the whole time. He heard everything you said, you racist cow.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, what?

[Speaker 1]
I heard all of your racism against the Irish.

[Speaker 4]
They deserve it. I'm a ginger, I'm allowed.

[Speaker 1]
Sucks to be you, buddy. I'm regrowing my beard for the first time in two years. Well, no.

First time since high school to remember that I had red in here.

[Speaker 2]
I shaved recently and I hate it. It was a terrible idea.

[Speaker 3]
It took me way too long to grow a beard and then it fucking came in Ranga.

[Speaker 2]
And I'm like, god damn it.

[Speaker 3]
Nothing wrong with Ranga's.

[Speaker 4]
That's fine. I don't care. Don't worry, Borowski.

I'm not saying other people have to have my colour of hair. Never said that. Never said that in my life.

[Speaker 3]
Say it all the time.

[Speaker 4]
Math got bleach blonde hair. Diverted. Go and bite onto that.

Do something with that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. Gay. Is that good?

It is.

[Speaker 1]
Let's get back from Miami Beach.

[Speaker 5]
God, you'd look good.

[Speaker 4]
You would fit in in Florida, Matt. Yeah. I reckon.

You sent that dress up for your party the other day and I was just like, oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Florida.

[Speaker 4]
I can see you walking around the streets where some dude is doing something ridiculous like fighting an alligator with his bare hands and not even noticing.

[Speaker 2]
Just walk right past it.

[Speaker 4]
Just straight past.

[Speaker 2]
Just in my own little world.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, man.

[Speaker 3]
There's a lot being added to this.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. It's a lot. We had something like 10 sessions last month.

I don't think you guys ever played with Kairona. Her first character was Kairona, but she started running sessions. Holy fuck.

I actually had time to prep for once. That's good. A bunch of stuff happened.

A lot of stuff happened. Oh, God. Now I think I have.

[Speaker 2]
I like seeing the feline. Damn it. I think I fucked up and I think I took away my magical items.

[Speaker 3]
You doofus.

[Speaker 1]
They should still be in Orville. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So I opened it up and then went to import day and day beyond to update it. And then I think I forgot to uncheck.

[Speaker 1]
You know what I got? I have that thing in a compendium. So I'm just going to go to Orville.

I think I could just drag this stuff straight into your character sheet. Nice. Nice.

Hmm. How do you get that? There we go.

Okay. It's the best one. It wasn't in the one compendium.

I was like, oh, man, that's what a dumb way. What a dumb time to open my fucking mouth. Hey, guys, I got the solution.

Don't quote me on that. I think I said five minutes ago. Hell yeah, I got that.

[Speaker 4]
That happens as long as you get there in the end. I've messed around with my infusions a little bit. I had one that was like, oh, yeah, you can expend a charge to add your intelligence modifier to a strength check.

But also artifices get like fucked amounts of attunement. And you can just make items. So Armourin would like to give himself a set of gauntlets of Ogre power, which is on the list that I can do.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
How strong is that maker?

[Speaker 4]
It's 19. I go from 10 to 19.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, beef. You gotta play the game, boy. All right.

Speaking of playing the game, I mentioned to Matt some of the and I also have the post in general as to what's going on. If you guys are ready to begin.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Might get up at some point in the next five minutes to drink some more Pepto Bismol. I got nauseous like no reason earlier today.

What the fuck? I gotta run over here. I know I ate something bad earlier, but that was like last night.

It's not supposed to be affecting me right now. Oh, no. Let's see here.

All right. So you guys were getting ready about like 10 months ago. Getting ready to fuck around with Thorecia, who you found out was in the town of Orting, which nobody has gone to in the entire campaign, despite it being one of the only marked settlements when the campaign began.

Where is it? It is smack in the middle, right by that like a White Dragon search area. Oh, wait.

No, no, it's not smack. It's a little bit center north of like Brownlock. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Cool. And there's a Green God of Orting or whatever.

[Speaker 1]
There is, in fact, a Green God of Orting. Players were discovering as time went on that Thorecia's plan was to absorb what used to be this shard of an elven god of knowledge named Sinbol. Who had been cast off and had been separated from the main god in an effort to like keep him alive, basically.

Keep the elven domain of knowledge alive. Ventured to this part of the planet because the elven god Sinbol had been killed, literally crucified. The memory of this god eventually faded out.

It had a little bit of worship inside this tiny, small town and was just barely keeping the vestige of this critter alive. And then Sinbol eventually was resurrected. And so this god was now independent from Sinbol and could actually begin regrowing.

Thorecia took advantage of this, started a new valley. It's currently wearing its skin and or puppeting it, depending on who you ask. Jesus.

You guys were intending on stopping this. And Wett took your armies over the mountains. Took a fairly decent sized warband, about 20 units.

Over the mountains, goblins, bugbearers, hobgoblins, a couple of sylvan troops. Primarily infantry with a couple of siege weapons. You also met up with the cold iron cleats.

Oh, I remember those guys. You guys made your way over and you were taking one final day to prepare because some of your troops had gotten lost. You were beset by illusions and enchantments and fake creatures were constantly trying to drag you guys off the trail.

Eventually the entire unit went missing and you guys decided, nope, we're going to stop here. We're going to go get those guys back and then we're going to do our final day of preparation and we're going to get rid of these guys. Unknowingly, you guys ventured into the world during this time.

Where time does not run as it does in the real world. You guys have been spending an entire 250 days training. Or more than 250 days training.

But only a single day has passed for you, you've only experienced it as a single day. Just kind of unknowingly, every once in a while looking over and thinking, hmm, that lamp looks oddly two-dimensional. And then going back to crafting and stuff.

[Speaker 5]
Had a whole life.

[Speaker 1]
And then yeah, eventually you made contact with Lepig Lice, or she made contact with you. She thought you were all dead because she couldn't find any fucking sign of you. Until she literally went into the lower planes to see if her souls had gone there.

And figured out there must be some kind of trick going on. She informed you guys of the situation. Theresia has basically succeeded in her goal to overtake the Green God.

She has one final trick up her sleeve. She wants to take you on her ballad, or a variant of her ballad, which is going to take you through Orville's memories. Through a rite of penance.

This rite of penance is going to involve memories of conquest, memories of exile, and memories of penance itself. Orville is going to get to choose which ones you guys go through. You'll have to go through one of each.

I'm really just combat focused. There will be troops along, but they'll just be adding to your damage and stuff like that. They're not going to be managing mass combats.

Cool.

[Speaker 5]
Nice.

[Speaker 6]
Before each mission starts, we're going to take a five minute break.

[Speaker 1]
So I can just load everything up and bring it in at once. And then it's just off to the races.

[Speaker 3]
So I'm playing a Yantee. Saskia. She's got a lizard snake head, snake scales, and humanoid body.

shit um really tough good warrior i've just been fighting in the band or whatever for a bit um i assume it's like a sort of mercenary maybe it was one of the cold iron clades if they're a mercenary or something like that but um something like yeah i don't know she's just so badass and a bit a bit mysterious and um but strong she's really fucking strong

[Speaker 1]
all right go ahead and place your tokens on the character sheet here or if not the character sheet on the map here i'll use this basically to uh copy you guys over every time the uh we switch scenes all right before you guys begin is there anything that uh memories are gonna three memories are gonna start appearing before orville is there anything you guys want to ask or clarify either me or theresia or any of the other npcs around is theresia here not theresia god damn it uh lepig lice

[Speaker 3]
big moth um she's a moth yep

[Speaker 2]
she just wants the light um no i don't think i've got anything i think orville's just frustrated to have been stuck for so long

[Speaker 4]
and uh is just raring to go yeah armor and just kind of like looking around at the urnt and moth woman every now and then i mean he's definitely come to orville at a couple of times 250 days but i'm like you know i quite like just a nice plain gnome girl back back home there's there's nothing wrong with that i don't they scare me a little bit a lot bit they scare me a lot bit what is a lot bit uh it's it's a bit more than a little bit uh but that bit's pretty big that makes it and a lot bit ah yes that is an interesting way

[Speaker 2]
to describe that you are a strange man yeah i've heard that before

[Speaker 4]
uh anyway it's uh it's wrong of me to assume that we'd be having intellectual conversation so

[Speaker 2]
all right smart enough to know that he's been insulted but not smart enough to insult you back just kind of nods and goes back to taking care of his bow um well probably all right leper glazer's around i'll wander over i'll bow i think that returns it

[Speaker 1]
how do we escape all right she points over to uh you guys are kind of in like a a pretty pristine like blade or mansion uh area that she sort of like just manifested into the local place she waves her hands and a portion of the horizon fades away to reveal the town of orton um and the other on the other side three divisions appear on the horizon each one containing a seed or memory she says she says every time you pass through one of these you will be brought closer to down the board and i've basically you will literally trailblaze you'll burn the path through the road and through the lower plains in order to finish this right to finish this ritual you'll be reminded of your rather sordid past and your troops will have to bear seeing it but i am confident that you will be able to return stronger than you were

[Speaker 2]
orville just kind of looks a bit uh he grits his teeth just kind of nods as then i guess it is time to uh for the others to see who

[Speaker 1]
i am each one of these will have a potentially a trick or corruption from teresia feel free to simply reinforce in your mind what the true memory was and of course many of these memories won't be true at all i actually can't see into all of them all of the memories i am able to view are are sorted of course but only one of them is true each time you complete one you'll come back

[Speaker 3]
here and then you'll have a new set of three to pick from lady lepically yes lady of transformations

[Speaker 1]
why take the form of a moth when you could be a snake the scales don't look quite as good as me which memory will we choose or before you i guess we shall see is a memory of exile on the left the memory of exile is when you first uh basically chose to leave because you tried raising a war band inside araman at the very least for like sport you're like hey let's have like mock combats or something like that let's not lose our our ability to conduct warfare let's not lose our martial prowess you were basically led or contacted by hobgoblins on the other side of the world who were attempting to start a war college in araman and the undying counselor the elders were very not okay with this because they were aware of the activities and he said fuck this i'm out and went to uh basically basically start your own war band he said i'm gonna have my own with blackjack and hookers traveled over the mountains west and you were set upon by a group of with only a few scant friends behind you were set upon by a group of highwaymen which you eventually led the second memory is a memory of conquest you find yourself having killed one of the elders when they attempted to bring you to and your compatriots basically teleported you to a new land because they wanted to show you what was going on and after killing this particular elder you moved on and joined a war band from a foreign land which you eventually used to return to this one the third memory one of penance in which you still killed that same elder um but you decided to to slay demons and begged for forgiveness from the gods to give you basically a trial that would have uh that would have helped clean a little bit of blood off your hands but not actually never actually fixed the bloodlust you did continue on the warlord

[Speaker 2]
well friends uh saying as you will have to join me on this journey through my memories i offer you to i ask that you share your opinion on which one of my memories uh we shall experience first i believe that it was probably best to start where the story begins with my exile and end with penance i fear that and uh was it lepiglace's lepiglace is around isn't she yeah she's right next to you you said that one of the memories

[Speaker 1]
wasn't real or corrupted oh no so here let me uh i'm gonna drag you into the other channel for just a second no fair enough wait wait it's not my server i can't actually drag you here come over okay so basically you choose which of these memories is quote the real one um inside of whatever memory you choose you could decide that a detail about it has been corrupted by let by uh thresia or obscured and you could just tell me which one that is that's actually real but so only one of these is real it's whichever one you choose that's why the second two are start from the same premise but um but go in different directions and then whenever you come back you'll have a new one for a new set of uh options to choose from okay i'm thinking i'm thinking

[Speaker 2]
penance is not real uh i i think i think orville is still going through his uh penance so i think

[Speaker 1]
that's that'll definitely be a right fake one it's just the theme of them you'll have to go through one of each kind but you'll have additional um okay you could do them in any order this is like a choose your own adventure board gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha all right easy easy all right wait fuck didn't let me in there we go okay um uh orville will kind of nod

[Speaker 2]
um yes i imagine we will with penance uh perhaps we begin with exile

[Speaker 1]
right if that if that is the one that's real go on um yeah orville will walk over to

[Speaker 2]
wherever the uh penance option is okay i'll be sure exile option oh sorry exile exile yes yes

[Speaker 1]
this way all right this is where i've our five minute timer begins jokey

[Speaker 3]
i mean that's what i'm gonna get that's what i want for christmas and that's great i've already got three and then i took one off my computer's just only got one hdmi port i have to get like a an adapter and shit right an upgrade

[Speaker 2]
i got three going and one of them's an ultra wide very happy i got one 4k monitor that usually has

[Speaker 4]
battle map on it and then one's discord or dnd beyond usually yeah damn it 250 days

[Speaker 1]
more so whatever it was 10 months so it's like um basically 300 300 days i can't bring up 250 because i think that's the threshold for training uh it's a threshold for training side of there we go just put you inside that cage there

[Speaker 4]
oh i'm more than happy to just go on a rant as armor and for five minutes if you'd like matt's usually playing the little adhd characters but i can do it too go ahead go ahead buddy my hay fever my head it's been 300 days it's all flowers it's terrible it's so it reminds me of when i was a little gnome and uh i'd go to my grandparents place and nona she would teach me how to smith and she would teach me how to be a stonemason and then uh grandpa he would knit and he wore this terrible perfume like it wasn't an orthodox relationship between them uh but oh god i'm telling you it was terrible as you couldn't walk in without sneezing but he just seemed at home with all these he smelt of lavender roses and thick other

[Speaker 3]
flowers in all the wrong ways that is how humans smell they smell disgusting the humans the humans

[Speaker 4]
just look rocks smell good it's you know people don't think about how good a rock smells that's in plain it's earthy i every time i bathe take a handful of gravel and you know just go and put it in various spots just

[Speaker 2]
to make me feel a bit more homely you know i look forward to experiencing my memories i hope that

[Speaker 4]
this is not one of them here i i'm not a part of your memory all right go ahead and drop yourselves

[Speaker 1]
on the right corner of the map here let me make sure that took a mission is not on it is not

[Speaker 4]
i almost dropped the femorian god that was a good time gotta get that man back uh he betrayed me it happens you know you know teenage years it's natural for the son to rebel against the father to some degree prodigal femorian yeah it's just it's a bit difficult when he is 50 times the size of you i didn't have many options for discipline

[Speaker 1]
the old wooden spoon fighting another thousand gnomes so you could uh or compose a mecca the right now yes the old ways discipline it's a year so y'all step out through the memory and into a pretty temperate climate it's like a spring day there's a chilly breeze but the sun feels pretty warm on your face you all appear relatively ragged having just gone a ridiculously arduous journey across snow-covered lands moving to the southwest to eventually find a more temperate climb to find another valley wasn't sun-kissed but being further south did have a or did enjoy a fair bit of not always cold a bit like montana you come down a paved road or relatively paved road and there's a bunch of men standing in a fort here along with some goblinoids and one of them turns around is like hey boss we got one coming around from the other side and the uh bandit captain here highwayman like wearing tattered clothes but with a mix of things that are rather fine and and uh clearly above his station leans over the wall looks down at a pile of bodies stacked in a cart nearby he says what's this then we normally only have people going this way now coming the other way back around i think there's a healing spring on the other side we paid one to tell your fellow to tell people that you know rich nobles who are ill that oh that go off into nirvana springs you wouldn't have happened to have seen it did you

[Speaker 2]
so wait so wait just so i got it right um these are just random highwaymen

[Speaker 1]
they're not highwaymen and the guy standing up top is specifically the one that you killed to take over this band of highwaymen do you recall that they attacked you swiftly uh after your first meeting after a bit of jitters

[Speaker 2]
um oval will just kind of stare at him yeah i have not seen such a spring back this way

[Speaker 1]
to lie to the people is despicable of you lying is bad you hear that boys he called me despicable soon i will call you dead all right then he's still taking it back like he was uh robbed of a one-liner one-liner there are goblinoids around like there's goblins hobgoblins and i think two bugbears uh they look a little bit unsure about joining the fight right now the rest of the people are down for it um some of the humans did not join the fight or sorry did not uh continue fighting after they were slain or after the uh after the big guy was slain but some of them did the goblinoids all surrendered by the time that the guy was dead all right go ahead and add yourselves to the combat tracker

[Speaker 3]
oh yeah right click oh yeah yeah yeah

[Speaker 4]
am i there and then just

[Speaker 1]
where can i just roll yep you just click on that little guy there so the uh second tab that says combat again yes yes and it doesn't look like there it is there you go you see all the response there

[Speaker 3]
ah yes all right what the hell with advantage at six what the hell did you roll

[Speaker 1]
twice all right he's one of the hobgoblins he's uh the the goboblins bob goblins the hobgoblins in particular recognize like the war paint that you're wearing and your livery is like this is not a guy to be fucked with uh he does nothing one of the blood hawks by one of these bandits is going to run over and attempt to attack orville i believe it's 16 missiles and that is a miss all right and armor room is up

[Speaker 4]
um so so far the red kind of humans are pretty hostile and old mate up top he is the big leader well the very yep that's him yep all right well i'd have line of sight from here to go and take a couple shots at him wouldn't i absolutely stand up yeah sweet big old revolver attack no more 26 damage no more oh good 26 he's gone he's done

[Speaker 1]
so huge i'm the leader now anyone else wants all right what else you've got for your turn another attack

[Speaker 4]
this guy looks tough he um running away oh well i suppose you'd be up on the battlements this little fort so whether or not i can see him or not yeah you could see him most of the

[Speaker 1]
battlements are facing the other way because they just kind of they want to make sure they could defend and ambush people and they haven't maintained them from the other direction basically nobody comes up this way 23 hits

[Speaker 4]
well that'll be the end of armoring son he's pretty content with that

[Speaker 1]
all right can brings us to warhol okey dokey

[Speaker 2]
what is warhol going to do i remind myself how to play as a monk uh i'm gonna punch this hawk it's gonna punch him kick the squirrel

[Speaker 1]
let's go wait yes attack that definitely hits definitely hits excellent i don't know if you can not kill this thing all right he's done he's done four excellent it was possible if you roll a one uh it would have just barely survived all right that gets flung in a different direction

[Speaker 2]
i got what 50 feet of movement oh that's good there there i think that's 50 feet all up

[Speaker 1]
the goblinoids at the moment are like just they start like cowling in fear as you start moving forward like oh oh shit i better i better not do whatever this guy was telling me to

[Speaker 2]
you can either join the fight on my side or you can die on their side and i think that'll be me all righty

[Speaker 1]
let's see here uh no no melee attacks no ranged attacks or anything like that

[Speaker 2]
uh oh i know i can do that that is true um what was it where we got over here this this is a how do i ping uh t when you're hovering over oh yeah oh that's cool um can i fire off an arrow at this is this a human looks like it yes you can yes all right i'm gonna fire off an arrow uh what's the light situation where we at you are in dim light excellent

[Speaker 1]
one of these hobgoblins is up next i'm gonna have him surround the druid here

[Speaker 2]
that's a 25 to hit 25 hits that is 13 damage 13 you recall that uh

[Speaker 1]
uh just in in the course of your memories you remember that uh you did leave this guy alive and he eventually betrayed you it was during the siege that he just tried stabbing you in the back i will not quit make this i will not allow you to make the same mistake not now all right one of the hobgoblins here runs over and begins attacking the druid in your memories this druid basically turned into a turned into a squirrel to escape and later came back with an army of blights to attempt to fuck up your uh your new your new war band never figured out why he did this but he let's see here there's a versatile thing should have martial advantage there we go i figured out why but you recall that he did have something of use all right one of the blood hawks is gonna run over here uh-oh let's see here got a hobgoblin over here i'm just gonna run over fuck up the druid he's gonna fuck him up nope i got a bandit over here he's gonna turn around and he's just gonna fight these uh these uh hobgoblins and such are just gonna fight each other for the moment fuckbears are gonna run over and what kind of hit points does this guy have so okay and the other guy is going to also have all right they have four showing right now so they're just kind of like whiffing on each

[Speaker 3]
other saskia is eyeing off these two humans close to her just a little bit of venom dripping from

oh shit it's like that is 19 hit uh i will prevent that with a parry for the first one

[Speaker 1]
and then the second one will hit all righty damage for the second one is 10 that is his turn this bandit is going to leave the other bandit behind and uh start crawling downwards oh that's how it works whoops all right there we go cool orville looking at the scene you remember this as yosef the coward he was called that by the rest of the goblinoids but he did fetch water and a pretty decent stew for the rest of the uh for the rest of the camp while he was still alive

[Speaker 3]
the coward must live yeah we've been stuck

[Speaker 5]
what we're menacingly blaming the revolver at him he must live i'm the cook

[Speaker 1]
22 definitely 11 he's literally that guy's hit points he is zero say this one was rolling to subdue you guys did have a couple of extra humor yeah you did have some extra humans left in there not that matters for this particular thing all right well that brings us to a dead

[Speaker 4]
blood hawk and then armoring yeah who's still looking hostile and not bitching it already

[Speaker 1]
uh the author and the the blood hawk there's a bandit up top who has miraculously survived so far yeah um armor and i'll take a shot at the frother uh 10 on 14 wait wait you have vantage because he did reckless oh all right i'm just doing another

[Speaker 4]
normal one 21 that definitely hits let's go 17 17

[Speaker 1]
all righty um we got a second attack maybe he's still up yeah he's he's bloodied at this point

[Speaker 4]
easy so you're gonna attack with advantages in 18 it's 17 that all righty he is still up but

[Speaker 1]
pretty worse for wear bring us okay all right i will uh take my free hand and i'm gonna

[Speaker 2]
punch this blood hawk let's go no way awful scrumpy he's gonna he's gonna do it again i do not remember being bested by a bird

[Speaker 1]
amazing all right yeah all right

[Speaker 2]
um and there's this druid in front of me is that what i he's currently a squirrel i am going to run up to him uh and just i think i well i think i'm out of oh wait no i've got a bonus action punch uh that is true yes i am having a struggle remembering uh

[Speaker 1]
that's right uh yeah it's one key for flurry of blows or you could just do a bonus action attack

[Speaker 2]
all right no i'm gonna i'm gonna spend a key point and make uh take flurry of blows

[Speaker 1]
oh yeah all right no that hits the squirrel seven right uh he takes six then i will uh do it again

[Speaker 2]
eight uh he is still alive but looking pretty bad i'll just like menacingly like stare down at this squirrel and just like loudly say oh he's druid now but you picked him up excellent i would just like stare at him like i will not allow you to escape and face me again looks really confused this dude just rocks off i was i was half thinking as we were rocking up like would orville even entertain having a conversation with a bandit leader that he knows is about to kill him like he's like i should just shoot him now and armor and just fucking did it

[Speaker 1]
that'll be me all right uh that druid is dead it's an arrow through his skull the hobgoblin who shot him gives you a thumb up looking for approval all of all gives him a nod to back i'm just gonna run over this way he'll shoot down the thing um oh he's doing that i'm gonna let i'm gonna skip these guys to let saskia go i'm gonna take an unarmed strike at this fella

[Speaker 3]
biting him in the neck um where's my dude let's go uh unarmed bite did it work there you go attack 13 just hits okay also you have advantage yeah we'll check for no crit fish no damage no bites 28 done uh you grabbed him right by the

[Speaker 1]
and there was just a spray of blood and green fluid poison just intermixes and goes everywhere

[Speaker 3]
i'll just keep biting i'm just he's she's out for a bit 250 days not enough humans did you see armor just caught

[Speaker 4]
fucking hammer on east coast

[Speaker 1]
this is concerning there's only room for one all right with that that'll be the end of uh combat some of the humans are recovered over the next few days you were uh you collected up the goblinoids and few humans who remained uh you conquered a nearby wild tribe of elves shortly thereafter you more nobles came looking for the nirvana springs you informed them that it was a trick and that you had killed the previous leader you didn't kill them but you did inform them that you would be taking their money as a recompense for what you've done you get an extra 600 gold to oracle's coffers excellent all of you will receive the benefits of the death ward spell oh watches like these little bits of the memory come uh streaming toward you and a little bit of a reason go ahead no it's not that i just see a death word come around

[Speaker 4]
and i think oh someone's gonna get disintegrated or powered killed let's just make sure it's not

[Speaker 1]
twice let's see here um the you guys look out across the gate and you watch as orville and a few of his pop goblin and bugbear lieutenants this is including orville the real orville himself watching this memory play out go riding outwards with their new war band and you just start seeing smoke erupt over the horizon and then you are back at the mansion there it is

[Speaker 2]
how did that memory go the first time that was a bloodbath it was quite similar um it was uh my first real experience of true violence in the world not just mock combat it was

[Speaker 4]
uh eye-opening yeah i was on board until you like robbed those nobles that was a bit much

[Speaker 2]
they were weak their money was better served their money was better put to use serving my purpose it was not the last group of nobles that i stole from at this point it's been 300 days

[Speaker 4]
if it gets us out of this place i don't care what you do well it's what i did well i'll deal with that moral conundrum would you do it again

[Speaker 2]
orville just kind of sits with that one he just sticks to himself i'll be thinking this is gonna take a while okay guys let's keep moving

[Speaker 1]
all right so you're back in the mansion lepiglice is uh waiting for y'all that she doesn't speak unless spoken to uh might go

[Speaker 2]
um i'll ask her so well maybe i'll just hang on maybe i'll just say this out loud as matt the player so the idea is i'm picking the memories that are real yes okay well i'll have another look in uh oval we'll just continue looking at the uh the memories that are available to it yep there's a new set of oh sorry got it

[Speaker 4]
oh it's okay just while all was off doing that armor and just reloading his revolver and kind of clicking through the barrel just kind of listening the answer if there's anything wrong with it it's fine he keeps a good ship he looks after his weapons but that's it he's been

[Speaker 1]
meticulously cleaning it for 300 days i guess normally he likes to take a good day to make

[Speaker 4]
sure all this equipment is uh checked up and ready to go before at least 50 of those 300 days have just been armor and pulling the gun apart putting it back together just tinkering with it but each time nothing wrong with it but he needs to go through the maintenance

[Speaker 2]
this is my rifle without it i am useless

[Speaker 4]
oh it's just an ounce of prevention would just be annoyed to the shithouse by the constant clicking like every small mechanical noise is coming from armor and throughout the entire day

[Speaker 1]
so the next three memories are first uh you are you see a street in which which you remember very very clearly um it was the first time you besieged a city and you were faced down by some cavalry just in the road and you immediately advanced to uh to well claim your birthright and most of your troops were in awe at the fact obviously right now it's because you're level 12 it's a fucking breeze for you but even back then you were like you're still at least a head taller than the boats that you were bringing down mostly on account of your training but by this point was it honed by real experience the second memory is of a boat you were transporting your warband to get some more supplies and look for potential mercenary recruits across an area and you saw a sea monster attacking a merchant vessel that you eventually incorporated the the company you incorporated that company into your warband for a time after saving them the third memory was a see here you were called to court for your dealings with the you were called to court for your dealings with the bandits and the fact that you got rid of that warband but also robs the nobles around the way along the way you were pronounced not quite innocent but you were pronounced like no longer an outlaw based on the fact that you had also killed those bandits and gotten rid of them and they're like blacklisted exactly they were like uh according to the customs and stuff like that like yeah you can't obviously if you do this anymore you're fucked and if you want to get a loan from a bank or anything like that you're gonna have to pay back the nobles first but besides that you'll be able to you know you'll be able to be a part of polite society and only about half of the onlookers agreed and it was a rather nasty bloodbath afterwards

[Speaker 2]
i think we will go with the sea monster yes number two already number two my lord um yeah number three we'll go into that one i remember saving these people

[Speaker 1]
that's good of me give me about five minutes

[Speaker 2]
okie dokie so during these five minutes so i've got you sent me this image where it says like um because some of the memories have been subject to corruption and interference i've got the option of correcting one detail about each location something like reason for being there a participant an item that was present or a location within the location that's correct no and that obviously the other two are permitted to make suggestions as to what you can be corrected well i will see what our situation is that we find ourselves in

[Speaker 4]
that's cool are any redemption on the docket for the day or penance is next i

[Speaker 2]
don't believe i truly started my uh steps towards redemption until

[Speaker 1]
very recently this one oh i forgot to mention uh two things oh god this one is perfect

[Speaker 4]
um i had too many sessions with matt if i hear the dm go oh this is perfect i get scared

[Speaker 1]
oh who should be

[Speaker 4]
death ward baby if a dm gives you death ward just out of nowhere that's the scary thing that's i'm planning to kill you but i'm gonna give you a shot

[Speaker 1]
one thing to note is the so you took what was it you took the exile path which was towards yeah so the vision that you have of orton on the opposite side of this little demiplane has shifted towards the front gates like the gates that you would meet by land facing west orton final note the charm that the the charm that the druid had on him was a luck stone which you lost shortly before coming back to some aid and one of you can go ahead and add that to your inventory

[Speaker 2]
i was on the wrong thing here uh if one of you guys want it i'm happy to let you take it

[Speaker 4]
yeah all my gear is pretty magical i don't think i got any room for it so uh all right sassafras i remember it's sasskia

[Speaker 1]
sassafras watch one of exile this one is of uh let's see here this one is also uh penance i say also penance this one is a penance that's gorilla dude fuck yeah oh you are terrifying

[Speaker 4]
too many excited damn noises all in one go

[Speaker 1]
let's hear you had a unit of archers with you and a unit of spearmen shielded spearmen will be aiding in the combat by rolling d6s for damage because that's all you have to do for when you're fixing them they just they just roll dice uh they just get some auto damage versus whatever the fucking thing that's harassing you is the accident is that okay okay go ahead and activate this one

[Speaker 2]
oh my

[Speaker 4]
you remember this right

[Speaker 5]
yes i don't remember it being on fire

[Speaker 4]
i was not here for this one but i think it has been established they are not my memory what the

[Speaker 6]
fuck is that oh dear god you chose this man that thing looks sick if you look at it you can see

[Speaker 3]
small little sharks in the picture oh god

[Speaker 2]
i did not need a thing to tell like give me scale jesus christ those are just uh blue fins that's they're just fishies they're just fishies

[Speaker 4]
wow you've got really tiny fangs don't you satsafred

[Speaker 2]
saskia in my mind it's just been 300 days of armor and getting saski's name wrong

[Speaker 1]
and now it's built in that's the problem there's no hook for correction at this point

[Speaker 4]
well it's like it's because he's got like three in his head sasquatch sasparilla sassafred and every time she said it's that's it yeah he's like oh it's not that's a prat it must be that gorilla endless loop it just resets every time he's also more than intelligent enough to learn a name he's just done it out of habit at this point because it's been a long 300 days all right here we go i suppose yeah it'd be a bit more frantic um so plan of attack how about we get

[Speaker 2]
the fuck out of here i remember defeating this beast leaving his cowardice i only i only accept one coward in my war band that is because he makes great stew i reckon i did it right for his money

[Speaker 3]
i wouldn't make him into steel that's when old boy goes all right addy

[Speaker 1]
that toggle on for me i reckon at this point is actually pretty beat up but uh still horrific this is well into the battle where it had already killed uh one of the mages that you saw all right we just need armor and uh initiatives yeah

[Speaker 4]
i'm trying to toggle the combat state it's not doing it you've already been added there we go

[Speaker 1]
if i click that oh okay we'll show you sweet i'm gonna have the uh troops roll their dice at the end of the round okay all right orville you're at the top of the round okie dokie

[Speaker 2]
i need to hang on actually let me get heaps and heaps of space i have to move myself around god how do i get off of the there's one no this is not loading oh um we get back to just controlling my token

[Speaker 1]
token controls all the way on the left and then i'll select and it automatically gets we have a module now for um marking how many feet you move excellent um

[Speaker 2]
i am going to use my bonus action to take my kensei shot so i get to deal an extra 1d4 damage uh and then i am going to fire off a shot at the kraken uh lorian's darkness for the uh

[Speaker 1]
for where you're currently standing

[Speaker 2]
let's go well that's a 17 17 hits excellent damage uh that is five but uh what is it forward slash

[Speaker 1]
uh slash r yes forward slash r there you go all right 12 damage then i'm gonna do it again

[Speaker 2]
23 10 then all right so all up that is 25 damage very good

[Speaker 1]
you also got your boy with you

[Speaker 5]
uh yes my hound what is that

[Speaker 2]
my shadow dog

[Speaker 4]
have been explained to armor and in the sliders yet because you've got a habit of fighting animals

[Speaker 2]
it might look like you're in danger oh no no yeah this i think i've had i've had this guy for a while he would this little this dog would have been around for like the last 300 days in the woad and all of that jazz um one dog you wouldn't kick that's beautiful yes amazing he is my favorite all right um let's roll him

[Speaker 1]
oh excellent oh he just goes on your turn um oh you if you hit with an attack and he's in range for critter that you want attacked then he just you just add his damage to yours and then otherwise you have to do actions as normal if you want to like uh play fetch

[Speaker 2]
yes uh can i have him run over and get in the fight absolutely well there we go like a terrified noble here uh he'll ignore the noble and take uh dash he is just gonna get right up right up in

[Speaker 1]
there uh and then that'll be me can't do anything uh not these lair actions actually count for anything here we go so instead he's going to do a tentacle tentacle attack on the um on the mast the way that you killed this creature was kind of in a sinbad style uh where you and the troops got him to uh basically impaled him on the mast the details of course are up to you uh that is one of his that brings us to saskia

[Speaker 3]
uh saskia's gonna run over and as she does the sort of skin of her legs kind of like falls away into like dust and she'll take her abomination form oh yeah rad oh she's shedding okay she'll just shed and she's just um and then i'll take an attack um two minutes um that's right just plus one is this looks like plus one of the ability check nope okay cool uh yeah so we'll attack with the constrict i'm going to try to it's very large so i'm assuming i cannot restrain it properly i'm just going to try to wrap around its head to kind of make it more difficult for to attack with its mouth i guess um it's a tail just 15 15 does miss unfortunately um and then i'll just take a swing with the sword then

[Speaker 5]
back back oh shit miss and that's saskia

[Speaker 1]
all right kraken is going to let's see here this time he's going to a another legendary action before his turn do a tentacle attack versus one of the uh noble folk here which succeeds this has no more than now before his turn turn he's going to do you're going to do a body attack on this one so it has to do body attacks or it has to do how the fuck it'll do one bite attack that's fine it's got a legendary access for real or shit what the fuck all right hold a second oh boy okay so that's 12d6 is for at the 12d6 is for acid damage oh boy um if you like yeah exactly all right cool okay that's just a yes you haven't been grappled so you just take

[Speaker 3]
3d8 was 12 plus 10 so 22 who's that on seska yeah that's on seska yeah all right the piercing is half so only 11 because i'm in my hybrid transformation

[Speaker 1]
all right then he's going to use a legendary action for i'm going to use two legendary actions for lightning storm um do that after he's here he's going to yank the nobleman with him and he's going to swim under the water the woman not go with him

[Speaker 3]
i'll take an attack of opportunity you may i'm gonna pop up back over here you're a constrict i'm gonna try to go with him

[Speaker 5]
oh

[Speaker 3]
what 22 to hit 42 hits and then for 13 damage and a grapple around it and get

[Speaker 1]
dragged with it is that cool he's going to use freedom of movement to escape from being grappled all right that's cool all right uh three bolts of lightning i need all three of you to make the dexterity saving throws

[Speaker 2]
what's my what's the base age uh 23

[Speaker 1]
then so evasion would just have it for you all right that's 22 lightning damage for all of you but uh ormal i think takes half uh no i don't think so but at this level uh monk you definitely have evasion yeah monks get it at um

[Speaker 2]
oh yeah no it's seventh level

[Speaker 1]
uh

[Speaker 4]
now it is armorin's turn it is armorin uh so anyway he started blasted i started blasted overall 25 to hit hits 21 off the first magical piercing nice next one 18 to hit

[Speaker 1]
18 hits 26 damage that'll be 47 damage all up all right hot dog he's not having a good time right now

[Speaker 2]
orville is orville is wondering why he didn't uh find aman or at least a gun sooner

[Speaker 1]
look at his face uh the warband raises their uh warband raises uh their banners these men are taking the role of the warband that you had previous but it's two units from your actual current warband uh so they've raised the flag that depicts a um your shadow mastiff this orzoi looking uh creature of darkness chewing a a gnome what looks like a red cap with butterfly wings in its mouth for the symbol of a warband and they all just start firing i'm just gonna do that the spearmen are gonna run up and right now the spearmen are just uh putting shields up to offer um be here right now just uh right now the spearmen are putting up shields to offer armor and cover

[Speaker 2]
and try thanks boys i'm gonna get you some better shields later i think we need a how to correct this uh memory slightly i think i think we should get a cannon i think i think i think daresia has uh removed a cannon from my ship

[Speaker 1]
okay a prize from one of your uh prior conquests was a magical ballista excellent is affectionately named headhunter uh given that it was in a forgotten language and the its true name was in a forgotten language and wasn't appropriately uh translated no matter how many times people tried to figure it out also there was this one time somebody shot it and uh they aimed a little high and it took a

[Speaker 2]
dude's head clean off somebody thought he could catch it and this houdini came out and tried to

[Speaker 4]
catch the bolt between his teeth yeah uh does not work quite as well as a blank from a pistol

[Speaker 1]
oops all right what would you like to do with this

[Speaker 2]
ballista uh i want uh one of my warband on the ballista just firing it at the kraken every chance

[Speaker 1]
they get all righty we're gonna use two we're gonna just use like this equal 12 bolt thrower my first attack is at plus six wait no first attack is at plus three hold on i know what this i already know so that should be all right 16 misses next one is at plus six which unfortunately also misses third one is that plus 12 which definitely hits 13 plus 12 is 25 and it's really fucking bad

[Speaker 2]
uh yes excellent you're in front of me now time time to punch all right uh i am going to punch

[Speaker 1]
16 just misses

[Speaker 2]
um well with that i can where is it where are you buddy i have something of the many something of the many fortune from the many if i miss with an attack roll or saving throw i can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies i can see up to a plus three bonus uh i can see at least two allies uh i'm assuming that there's other like the warbands yeah there's a fuck ton of guys here all right so i guess that's actually a 19 which does hit

[Speaker 5]
come on

[Speaker 2]
that's a 12 and i am going to expend a key point to make that a stunning strike so uh constitution saving through dc 15 all right this is what i think he's got

[Speaker 1]
out of fire plus 42 that was close ah that was a little low is anybody an herbalist oh boy no i am not here's the dumping that every single time uh landy uses a monk just

[Speaker 2]
this verbal hit dice you feel no no um all right well i'm going to uh take another punch why not um oh and i'm sure i can attack roll that's a 21 uh then damage seven uh and then i will expend a key point to do a flurry of blows all right going to punch again uh that would end up being a six uh oh no you can probably use my fortune money which i won't and then i'll i could get up yep and they all miss um this is kind of throwing up tentacles

[Speaker 1]
and like a desperate attempt to keep itself alive at this point then i am going to risk

[Speaker 2]
the attack of opportunity and i'm going to run away how many shadow boxing up here

[Speaker 1]
hey pardon how many feet away did you move uh 50 oh 50 okay because there's a reach of 30 so depending on where you move might not have actually even made it all right uh he's going to take that type of opportunity yeah that'll hit 21 bunch of crows

[Speaker 2]
ah easy all right uh and you are currently grappled and we shot it that didn't help at all all right i've got to help uh jules find a dog collar but i will be

[Speaker 1]
right back on that's good uh he's going to do a fling attack his legendary action and throw you back to where you were going oh my god he threw you with that

[Speaker 4]
it's 3d6 for every 10 feet it was thrown and then that was thrown 50 feet no 1d6 1d6 it says it oh yeah yep no 1d6 there we go yeah three is the uh three is the average so i guess three is the average that's a lot better that's a third is bad it's been worse

[Speaker 1]
could have been a lot worse oh it's pretty bad it's not good it's not good actually wait how does his uh workflow work while i'm looking at that you guys can

[Speaker 3]
let's see here saskia is up next um saskia sort of runs sort of slides along on their like massive tail towards the mast sort of coils up it and then leaps off to a bite this fucker um climbing about 15 feet on the mast and then jumping off oh yeah you can make the attack with advantage it's not expecting it 28 to hit that hits 21 damage unless it's nude poison and then as she sort of like slides down she'll take a sword attack two flames in the thigh um that hits probably not with advantage

[Speaker 1]
oh yeah so the one that oh there you go same number

[Speaker 3]
uh 18 and she sort of slides down his side with the flames meant to be back over there

[Speaker 4]
no no you got flung oh i got flung back to the spot where uh right right right you got shit whipped

[Speaker 2]
i got like i sat down and all i could see was like i saw two

[Speaker 1]
orville tokens and i was like oh okay it's see here it's gonna use the legendary action to use another technical attack against the mast and grapple it and on its turn it is going to uh use its action it's going to use its action to throw the mast at orville

[Speaker 2]
oh god um okay you have a death ward i do have a death ward i also have deflect missile

[Speaker 1]
you can use it on this

[Speaker 2]
all right that will hit um the question is how much i'm going to be able to

[Speaker 1]
oh that was supposed to be him

[Speaker 2]
all right so that it did 11 yep all right i'm going to deflect missiles and 1d 10 plus 5 plus 11 which brings it down to zero which means i'm going to spend a key point to throw it back and i'm i'm going to throw it back all righty um so i get to make a ranged attack which i guess i'll use just the standard

[Speaker 1]
as that uh that is an 18 that hits as we have confirmed feel fucking good okay uh this thing throws the mast at you you catch like basically the above it's it's a poor throw and it goes it tumbles head over heels bounces basically off the deck but you catch it on the second bounce you get pushed another five feet back all of your men all the spearmen uh run up and grab the mast ready to plunge it back into this thing uh yeah i'll just literally plunge it into it uh this thing had three hit points left so it's toast fucking rad fucking rad you're able to recover all the merchants even though even the one who's currently grappled who's just gotta get slumped over on the deck and this thing sinks into the bottom of the sea you're able to recover a fair bit of gold from the merchant vessel and like i said these guys eventually did join your war band

[Speaker 2]
i uh i offer them uh my services well the services of my war band as protection until then and then

[Speaker 1]
when they do join they already know my men yeah that's basically how they joined us they're not really fuckers themselves but they they're recovered a lot of goods or were really good at selling and occasionally fencing stolen goods but selling goods and then occasionally fencing stolen goods and they made it back to let's see here all right take that condition off but you guys are at um the same hit points and such between come back here yeah right i didn't mean to click activate i meant to click uh damn it on the net there we go

[Speaker 5]
race with a spoon

[Speaker 2]
i'm pretty sure that's one of landy's characters i have a feeling

[Speaker 4]
there's something wrong with the eyes i've just got the

[Speaker 1]
it's probably like hey i generate blood oh that's nessie uh that's one of uh that's paris red i had no idea who that person was though

[Speaker 2]
oh here uh let's go back to that elvin elvin virgil yeah i was sitting there thinking the

[Speaker 4]
same thing where's dante oh that's rad all right did he cut off your son's arm to make

[Speaker 2]
a katana out of or not well he made the i think that's how he got his katana back i don't yeah it's a bit iffy nero's definitely down an arm

[Speaker 3]
i was trying to have at least one hit point but fewer points

[Speaker 4]
i've got devil may cry 5 on my computer i didn't play it yet

[Speaker 1]
um i need to your mac bullied me into it and uh watch as i tried to play it as a cover shooter at first to piss them off terrible time but yeah you guys uh memory hurt more than i lost and it goes uh let's see here orville i don't know if you actually have this on your character sheet but you were given a sword called the pathfinder's pin slash needle

[Speaker 2]
uh i don't know if i have it on my uh anymore but i do now remember that yes i'll pull it up

[Speaker 4]
there we go um armorin's gonna cast kill wounds on himself uh sorry

[Speaker 1]
oh that looks painful the pathfinder's pin slash needle has become uh semi-sentient and is now a plus three weapon rad uh armoring your firearm it would be really fun to make this uh sentient uh the plus one pistol uh it's not you keep shooting me the plus one pistol is now a um can now function as a flamethrower oh so you could just do you spend a shot to do 46 save for half in a or not save for half um it's 46 in a 15 foot cone or 30 foot line uh anybody you miss just takes half damage you just like make one roll

[Speaker 4]
that's and compared to the that's uh that's just the just the normal plus one i not the uh

[Speaker 1]
hash gun yeah the plus one he's got kitted out is the flamethrower now has been upgraded to plus two saskia the flame tongue scimitar is now capable of casting wall of fire and also now has a personality he has fall flier wall fire twice per day um pc 15 for the save nice cool penance all right the new set of encounters here is uh oh after the let's see here after this uh penance memory has been undertaken you are now once again closer to orton but you are looking more towards the actually looking from the sea but not the sea the the lake it's a really big lake um you're looking at the at orton from the lakeside and you can see because you've been in the feywild before like this glamored hidden path that's sort of coming out of the feywild and would take you directly to orton's backside excellent i think uh i think we aim for that

[Speaker 2]
or no wait no we'd have to do another memory before it's fully revealed and then the

[Speaker 1]
afterwards once you complete the third one which you have to complete one of each so at some point you have to complete conquest um you can do more memory you'll be able to do more memories to like orient yourself specifically however you'd like towards the city okay short rest for additional

[Speaker 3]
yeah you could i think we should yeah i could use a little bit a little bit of a hero

[Speaker 4]
you can just hit short rest kind of i think so

[Speaker 3]
where's it oh yeah oh okay cool oh cool

[Speaker 2]
now it's actually pretty rough it's a much more useful way of doing that

[Speaker 5]
yeah

[Speaker 3]
cool cool done um no

[Speaker 1]
all right so the three memories ahead of you um any chatting or talking that you guys want to do

[Speaker 2]
so far um this is how you got your war band this is how it grew yes then it came time for larger fights of conquest of spreading my influence across the region the world i imagine that that will be the next memory we must explore and how does succession work asking for a friend marvel just kind of stares like very obviously understanding what like what you're getting at when someone proves themselves worthy of taking over my war band i'm sure they will fight me for it and if they best me then it is theirs by then my tradition it is theirs by conquest

[Speaker 4]
so if so if someone were to like best you in single combat and you were to die and then you took over the thing would they have to be a war band or could they perhaps work in a factory for

[Speaker 1]
said new leader and um process raw materials the strong a real fight is in the steel mill

[Speaker 2]
the strong uh that are capable of leading such a war band are able to choose uh how their skills are used but it would be a waste to have them do anything other than fight i don't think so

[Speaker 1]
the gods of war kill all the blacksmiths first speaking of which the two of your units that went back um and watched you do this were participated in the fight like us is your commander did you did you really kill the creature that way

[Speaker 2]
uh no no uh we we managed to trick it uh into wrapping itself around uh the merchant ship uh and then we fell the masts uh stabbing it through its body uh it was close but no when we killed it with the masts the first time it was not with uh a group of men shoving it into its stomach and it was not as impressive a catch from me

[Speaker 1]
and you have claimed two vic uh claimed two glorious victories and all the troops are going

[Speaker 2]
nuts horrible just kind of uh nods just like stoically takes that on board there was once a time where he may have roared out in victory as well but uh he has calmed down he has a quiet purpose now and that is to uh he just kind of looks at leper glaze there he goes um we must continue i i do not wish to celebrate until thurasia is dead

[Speaker 1]
uh let's look at what memories we got now okay so uh for exile there's the merchant company you eventually pilfered most of your troop supplies well you guys had basically you guys deployed first and cleared a beach and they were supposed to come in behind with a fleet of goods and such and they just they just turned around with the complete opposite direction and left you guys with nothing so your men were like hey uh we're not actually we're not doing this sucks we're not doing shit you got us into this mess we're not doing anything unless you could find us supplies and gold pay and um and so you did uh there is a dragon's horde before you inside the memory for conquest you besieged the city you did it for petty reasons a foreign lord had uh claimed that you were nothing more than a you know basically a band of highwaymen and robbers because you didn't have a home base you moved from place to place so you decided to take his and prove him wrong and for penance you fought a lion demon which as if you were falling too far into bloodlust and this restored you for time and kept you from falling straight into the planes

[Speaker 2]
we will uh i'll look i like i look at the exile one the merchant company and i just kind of uh i shake my head and i go no that's i would never have allowed that to happen and i'm going to look the the city memory and uh go yes i remember claiming my first settlement this is this is the memory we must fight now no walk towards conquest let's go

[Speaker 5]
um

[Speaker 2]
you can you can know for a fact that if uh if bloody uh the merchant group abandoned me on a foreign island and then my men stopped following me because they weren't getting paid i would absolutely i would go and find a dragon's horde and then i'd come back be like here's your money also the leader of your rebellion is dead i'm killing you and i'm finding this merchant company and we're sinking all of their ships and killing them as well like how fucking dare you in in my head orville was like a homicidal like maniac uh but then so basically like the reason he wants to go after thoresio isn't because you know thoresi is out doing all this evil shit or anything like that um i'm pretty sure it's that if i'm remembering it correctly it was uh orville got tricked into leading his warband into some fight or something and it was revealed thoresio tricked him and so while she didn't best him in combat uh she did well best him at least in combat she did uh end up killing off his like entire warband and so his whole thing is just saying i'm getting revenge on this one bish yeah she was obvious

[Speaker 5]
i look forward to killing god as do i

[Speaker 2]
really just want to go home that is part of the job there is no way to kill her until we can get home don't worry i won't leave you here oh i think it's more concerned if i leave you here you know it's the old bow's not doing as much as this black powder

[Speaker 4]
you should upgrade you should upgrade yeah reasonable price i probably won't even charge a labor but we can make you something

[Speaker 2]
i do half imagine as a ken say like the idea is these all those like japanese archery but i'm definitely imagining after a while he ends up getting like a musket or something

[Speaker 3]
yeah go for keanu reyes like fucking john wick

[Speaker 1]
is he gonna look like

[Speaker 4]
homerun's just gonna go and like take out the revolver and start going through it with you so now obviously this one's for me so it's a bit smaller than something that would be for you benefit of that we can pack a bit more powder into it all right so you got the cylinder here sticks around pretty standard mine's magic so if i run out it'll just refill itself but they don't punch as hard unless they've got that beautiful black powder telling them they're gods who've graced us with that one have you ever run out of this black powder ah once or twice but that's why i've got enchanted it shoots a bit straighter with my modifications and if it is to run out of ammunition it'll fill itself back up but again there's no imitation on the real stuff you know magic magic's all well and good

[Speaker 2]
honestly it's metal it's fire it's iron that's the stuff that's going to keep us going obviously a brilliant weaponsmith and i appreciate that you focus or you understand and appreciate the power of good metal when compared to or steel and weaponry compared to that of the magical ways

[Speaker 4]
typically steel that wood bow that you've got

[Speaker 2]
fuck it off mate it's yeah it's not the time for it anymore in my opinion this is the uh this is the last memory or physical memory i have of my last war band i will be rid of it when i am rid

[Speaker 4]
of my quest all right sentimentalism yeah personally yeah what's holding you back in life you know something to think about don't take too long on it we still got to get home

[Speaker 2]
shame all of all that cracks a smile it's like oh what is another 300 days with your company i'll fucking hell i'll play it's not i think he's threatening you i think he might be

[Speaker 1]
pick a memory all right give me a second let's try this again oh i know what happened that fucking okay

[Speaker 3]
don't fucking figure it out let's see here i might take the hybrid form before we go in

[Speaker 4]
yeah i might go through my spells i should probably use those but why do that when you've got a great pistol again fire and iron who needs magic i just like punching things blood yeah so i know you love hitting animals

[Speaker 2]
i really fucked that squirrel up you drop kick that squirrel i missed the first bit

[Speaker 4]
thought that you just ran away from the fight to go and drop kick a squirrel and uh i'm glad that wasn't the case but yeah after you flounder around

[Speaker 1]
you can't talk you can't talk all ten is that you i mean wait you can't talk i could fix this you can't talk i know what to do so uh this is the town of oric oric you marched on it and besieged it for you waited specifically until nightfall because it was a mostly human population and you started off by sending assassins in and saboteurs to firebomb the slums in particular because they were well suited for they were particularly well suited for catching light and you let it burn for about about three hours before you gave your army the okay to move ahead you wait until it was basically a really foggy night until you actually moved in and then everybody swarmed around the uh around the siege but okay so there are five paths in your army is going to take all of them in during an encounter you can have um see here you're going to choose two paths that your army is going to focus on and they're you're going to take one path which could be any of those but i know what all these little all these symbols mean encounter and i know what they mean excellent um let us i think we take the leg top route

[Speaker 3]
uh what do i do again so your army goes down two of them to focus they go all of them but they go

[Speaker 1]
they put most of the weight behind two speaking of which oh i could just actually why not just uh revealing this so because you already did this

[Speaker 3]
i don't want to say and i did a i did a dumb thing i've done all the don't think

[Speaker 1]
okay so the top layer was pretty heavily fortified at the front and had some siege weapons behind it the see here the very bottom had a what was it a mob that was being chased around by swordsmen uh see here the third one had the one in the very middle was swordsmen backed up by siege troops which were backed up by archers number four was swordsmen with uh there are no troops behind but just well fortified traps and then a shield of troops behind that and then the very last one the one all the way to the right was archers and then there were horsemen behind it i

[Speaker 2]
think we deal with well do you guys have any opinion on or any preference attack any of them confident i think perhaps we go with the uh the siege weaponry in the in the first option go and clear out some of that shit yeah all right go

[Speaker 1]
all right i gotta oh that's right i gotta select your guys so i can copy another all righty these guys run along here

[Speaker 2]
what's your speed map i have a 50 feet of movement but if i do yeah and then also i can i've got a fey gift and so if i take the help action as a bonus action i can give one of the fey gifts i have as passage so that increases my walking speed by 10 feet so i can be up to 60 feet and then yeah what was it step of the wind that's like yeah what 120 feet and 180 feet yeah nice i've got 25 feet of movement speed

[Speaker 3]
and if i dash it's 50 i didn't realize our blood hunters well actually it's i think it's just the

[Speaker 2]
black and one hunter gets extra speed oh that's rad yeah i had the uh what was it oh god i've was like i think at one point if i was raging and dashing and all that crap i i had insane movement well i think that was the thing it's like liam had one of the uh characters tried to like run away and i was like buddy i'm catching that easy

[Speaker 1]
whoops i lost connection for a second that stopped doing that god fucking damn it foundry fuck you you're back oh you lost connection oh oh you almost had it

[Speaker 3]
uh they're all dead let me go do the dead okay a couple more cars let's see here

[Speaker 1]
there are also some civilians attempting to put out fires uh by the uh by these places and like just desperately just desperately uh cowering okay i'm gonna have all the i'm gonna have one of the guards roll like once and have them go at the same time you do have a signal flare to signal for uh a artillery bombardment and you can do that once basically once every 10 minutes

[Speaker 2]
fucking yowza all right

[Speaker 1]
and currently you're backed up by a group of uh you've got shielded troops of your own behind you so anything that gets into melee with you they'll be able to follow up oh fuck i forgot to get right on the screen all right i have to click the little guy i think there you go armand you are up first at 20

[Speaker 4]
my audio was cutting in and out for a second but i take it all hostiles yeah

[Speaker 1]
that's correct with the exception of the uh civilians they're trying to put out fires

[Speaker 4]
all right um in that case one two three four five uh how big was the cone on that

[Speaker 1]
pistol either 15 foot pole or 30 foot line

[Speaker 4]
i'm gonna save it for now i'm gonna just use a hush gun for a couple of shots i'm gonna go for old mate rocky up the back attack normal is a 20 hit sure does 14 going again 26 to hit this is 19 nearly a crit there you go 34 damage to rocky brutal

[Speaker 1]
all right that brings us to uh orville obviously if at the end of any of your turns if you feel like i've like skipped anything you're free to pop in a bonus action if you remember something or uh move your character if you remember something that what oh wait i actually want to be over here that's really fine um yeah that is yeah that was all of a sudden move myself there i'm gonna go where are you where are you where are

[Speaker 2]
you double check my kookatora every time you hit an enemy from which you are keeping a game plus one counter okay so i don't

[Speaker 1]
we don't have that many counters on it usually what you do for that is you uh you would like cast darkness out of it though and you're like auto hitting from them and then you go

[Speaker 2]
well in that case i might just um okay i'm gonna fire off at the uh earth elemental uh i'm gonna take bonus action to use uh my kensei shot so i get extra uh darkness wise what are we looking at

[Speaker 1]
goddess right now you are in you're not in the fire so you're still in dim light excellent

[Speaker 2]
uh it's a 23 against the earth elemental it's i was just fucking this guy up um four all right so that is 11 damage so far um then i've got something else here so that i can add more to my weapon oh okay yep once per turn when you hit a target with kensei weapon i'm gonna spend a key point i'm gonna make a deal 1d8 extra damage all right all right so that is 14 all up on that first hit pretty bloody i'm going to attack him again 28 seven whoop typing in the wrong thing uh so eight damage on the second strike uh and then i'm gonna have my little shadow mastiff

[Speaker 6]
he's gonna run up here to this little dude and he is going to bite

[Speaker 1]
me he has advantage on this by the way on dim light or darkness he is invisible

[Speaker 2]
that is a 22 to hit that is seven piercing damage uh and it needs to make me a dc 13 strength saving throw against being dead all right pretty sure he only gets one action but he will then go so i think it was 15 he's just gonna rush up towards the next one and uh that'll be me all good

[Speaker 1]
sounds good all right earth elementals up next he's going to uh sink into the earth

[Speaker 5]
okay

[Speaker 3]
okay massive tail around and crack the stone or whatever. Visage is on it and I cast fear on the whole mob here.

Oh shit. Ummm. So.

Just gonna ask around. Oh it's only 30 people. Ummm.

Jesus. I can't. Oh I'm just putting them everywhere.

[Speaker 5]
Fuck my life. Either that or I don't even know what I want.

[Speaker 3]
I can't see the one behind me.

[Speaker 5]
Do do do do do. Oh fuck off.

[Speaker 3]
That's a lot of wisdom saves. Those are good rolls. What the actual shit.

[Speaker 1]
The first few were really good. Alright so 8 of the guys save. 16.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and then. So I'll just have these guys. I'll put frightened on them.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
And then bonus action. I'll mark this acolyte dude with one of these blood curse shits. Ummm.

Black blood curse. Make sure of this. I need to take d8 of damage.

2. That's hot. Love it.

Ummm. I'll put it in my curse. I think it hurts.

We'll make it. Ummm. Next wisdom save.

Let me see what. Oh there it is. The marked.

Blood curse of the marked. Ummm. No additional.

It just takes extra damage. He's basically marked. Against the target.

And I'll amplify it. That's what the pain was. I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 6]
Oh okay.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. Yeah so he doesn't take any damage. I take 2 damage to amplify it.

And he's got. Oh wait I should be able to click it. That's a thing hey.

Blood curse of the marked. This one. Yeah.

Until the end of your turn whenever you hit the target with a weapon. Takes an extra damage. And then amplified the next roll I have.

Is at advantage. Okay end of my next turn. Cool.

So he's marked. Anxious. No marked.

Sorry. Blood curse of the marked.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. He's going to do his turn to cast. Dining Bolt at you.

I'm going to go d20 plus 4. So I'll just roll the d20. Ooh.

19. Alright. So I'll take 9 radiant damage.

Next attack has advantage on me. Against you. And then you guys here.

3 catapults go off.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Next turn. That's his turn.

A bunch of the guards are going to flee. They're going to run behind. And you guys see appearing into the memory.

A water cart with a bunch of civilians. Just kind of like appear behind the guards. And then immediately run away in terror.

Excellent. The rest of these guards are going to move up with. I'm going to have the Alkalite move up as well.

[Speaker 5]
Guys in the back line are going to miss.

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck? Well that's going to hurt. Fall damage.

And last attack misses. The guards back here are going to make. Actually they can't really see you all.

Armoring right now. Let's see here. So they're going to make ranged spear attacks versus orbal.

Which I think is a ranged one. It's just like a normal spear attack. Oh it's 20, 60.

Which I think orbal is actually out of. Not that they were going to hit anyways.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
An 18 and 19. 21 hit orbal.

[Speaker 2]
I have an 18 AC. So yes.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. So this ranged attack deals. 3 damage.

[Speaker 2]
I will take that. That's easy peasy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright that's going to bring us to armoring.

[Speaker 3]
So these like catapults about to hit. Is that like the.

[Speaker 1]
They're going to hit at the end of the next round. That's cool. Or this round rather.

Oh. This guy is also dead. He's been killed by a spearman.

[Speaker 5]
Someone's dead. Killed by a spearman.

[Speaker 1]
21 hits. Which guy are you shooting?

[Speaker 3]
Oh me.

[Speaker 1]
I think you mean. Is that guy already? Is he talking?

Ah audio troubles that's right.

[Speaker 5]
Oh shit. Audio troubles.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright I'm back. Sorry. Headphones do a fucky thing where they disconnect if I don't talk for a little while.

Oh shit. Yeah I pinged 2 shots off. The second one was dog shit.

It was only a 10 to hit. And that will be my turn. That's all good.

Brings us to Orville.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm going to get out of this catapult situation. Although I have.

An earth elemental in front of me by the looks of it. I think he's underground.

[Speaker 1]
He is indeed underground.

[Speaker 2]
Nah he's burrowing. Little fucker. Alright.

How tall are these buildings? Next to us. Can I jump up on top of one of them?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I mean you're a monkey. You can literally run up walls. Yaw.

Alright. I need myself to get up there. I saw you hovering over that mule.

Do I want to kill the apple cart? I'm thinking about it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to pop off a shot. Take my bonus action kensei shot. At this dude.

I think that's how I've done that. Dim light. Hit.

That is a 27 to hit. That is 11 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty much. Any of these guys are minions with the exception of the acolyte. Who also doesn't have a lot of hit points.

Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
I'm then going to shoot the acolyte. 17. 14 damage.

Thumbs up. 18. Having added my kensei shot.

And that'll be me. Oh, my shadow mastiff is going to get out of the way. That ain't good.

You can just have him deal damage to somebody. He's going to run up. He's going to bite.

The dude immediately to his left.

[Speaker 1]
Because remember, you don't have to roll attack rolls for companions. Oh, right, right, right, right.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
And now that'll be me. Stay out of trouble. Definitely staying away from that.

[Speaker 1]
Come here, you. Oh, god. He's going to make one slam attack.

I'm going to give him advantage for popping up. Oh, shit. He didn't need advantage.

8 damage. And then his second attack is going to be a grapple. I need you to pull either acrobatics or athletics.

[Speaker 4]
Let's have a quick look and see what you have. Yeah, I've got 98 strength. Athletics or acrobatics.

It would be athletics. No more roll.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, that definitely makes it. Well, well, well. You can't do anything here.

Yeah, that brings us to Saskia. Ah, I'll attack. Go to my right with a big...

[Speaker 2]
Constrict.

[Speaker 3]
23. Fucking slam his head into the ground. Move forward.

I'll take a bite at this guy. As a bonus action. Yep, bonus action.

And flamesword against the other guy. Already. Flame and bite.

17 to hit. 14. And then the bite.

28 to hit. Oh, that's hot. For 16.

It's fucking gone into a bit of a blood frenzy.

[Speaker 5]
Ghost.

[Speaker 1]
They're absolutely fucked right now. This guy is going to be... He's the last one left.

And he's going to attempt to flee. Which is... Oh, his turn is next.

So if we make an attack of opportunity against... I will grab him and then... 16 to hit?

Just hits, actually. It's chainsword plus shield. And then the shadow massive can also make an attack of opportunity.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, 18. I was like grabbing him with my tails.

[Speaker 1]
He fucking tries to get away. He's a minion from 4th edition. So if he gets hit, he's done.

And Orville, you can tap your shadow massive. Make an attack against the last guy. Yes, excellent.

He will do that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, that shadow massive is just going to chase him down. Uh-uh. Let me old bitch.

Alright. Just got this earth elemental to fuck up.

[Speaker 1]
Hit you. Pretty much. He's in the...

There's resistance. So he's got one hit point left. Oh.

Alright. Armour and mage, your turn.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to cast shadow on old man over here. Alright, he dies.

[Speaker 1]
There's literally no way of living through this.

[Speaker 4]
Alrighty. He's got disadvantage on the save too.

[Speaker 1]
So, that worked. Disadvantage is one hit point left. There is no possible way there.

It was a close fight.

[Speaker 4]
Could have gone either way.

[Speaker 1]
Haha. Alrighty. Give me a moment.

I'm going to go take a drink of water. And then you guys tell me whether you're going to... Reflare, are you guys going to sit here and fortify for a moment?

In case the other guys ahead of you push inwards? Or are you going to push forward ahead? I feel like we'll just keep mowing in.

I think, yeah, we will just push forward.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds good.

[Speaker 4]
Sounds good to me. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I'll just use the same map. So, I'll put you guys back at the...

As you guys press forward, one final note. So, your troops have been ignoring those of you who are still... Those of them who are still okay.

A bunch of them got hit by the... By the catapults. And you did...

A few of the good old boys did get knocked out.

[Speaker 5]
But...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, whoops. Oh, because you were standing on somebody. There we go.

As you guys push forward, they didn't interact with the civilians, obviously. But when you look back, something just tugs at your memory, or both. And you look back and you see your former warband...

Skewering through the civilians. Just trying to put fires out across the streets. With an image of yourself leading them forward.

Didn't participate yourself, but he's kind of like... Smugly walking through as they were...

[Speaker 2]
Orville... Current Orville grits his teeth. Shocked at the vision in front of him.

And where he once was.

[Speaker 1]
Your troops have... Your current troops have the same expression.

[Speaker 5]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
Ah... Orville will just shake his head.

[Speaker 2]
In my youth I was... I was blood-hungry. I will not allow myself to slip like this again.

But we must continue. Before we lose ourselves in this memory. Tusky's just mowing through guards.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah!

[Speaker 2]
Ah yes, I won't... I won't allow myself to fall to such bloodlust. My second in command here though...

[Speaker 3]
Oh god!

[Speaker 2]
Don't worry, she won't eat any of you humans. Maybe some of the others.

[Speaker 3]
I'll eat stew.

[Speaker 6]
Not stew. Not stew, eh?

[Speaker 3]
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[Speaker 2]
let's see here

[Speaker 1]
all righty so uh saskia you are up first i'll climb up on top of the or we'll go ahead and add three um

[Speaker 3]
uh three 10 foot blasts um at the back i'll climb up on the barricade and i'll hold out the sort of flame sword and just like pointed all of them um threateningly and behind them appears a wall of flame um just sort of like snaking its way through the whole group of um people here it's the length of it i'm just gonna have them uh die here yeah yeah uh 60 feet long so yeah there we go

[Speaker 1]
how does one draw the blasts uh use what is it um circle temp go down to measurement controls which is down to the token controls and then you just choose a circle template it's a click and drag

[Speaker 3]
how many do i get to do again three yep um yeah so the these guys as well possible

[Speaker 1]
like a snake these ones are gonna make sense uh one of whom fails so he's not gonna be able to survive that 48

[Speaker 3]
awesome

[Speaker 1]
oh whoa that's sick all right all these have uh you could add effects to these let's go all right oh i'm gonna press the button is that saskia's turn yep all right that brings us to oracle

[Speaker 2]
all righty uh similar to before i'm gonna free up my own here i'm gonna jump up onto the roofs again myself here and then i'm gonna start firing off at this fire giant uh dim light question mark

[Speaker 1]
uh dim light yes actually if there you're in darkness it is night

[Speaker 2]
can i try and hide i can cast darkness i think i'm going to uh oh no i'm just gonna fire off okay let's go uh 17 since the fire giant just misses i am going to use uh that not the they gift i'm going to use the uh where is it where is it where is it where is it the other one that i have uh oh god why can't i save face fortune fortune from the many get my get my plus three again from having all my allies around me all right so that'll be 30 20 he is that does it excellent uh bonus action can say shot so 15 damage uh d4 uh i'm on 19 then i'm going to use a deft strike to add a d8 to it all right so what's that i'm on 24 now and i'm gonna take a second attack it's 20 40 here 11 all right so that is 14 piercing on the second attack uh and 24

[Speaker 1]
piercing from the first attack pretty good all right um almost a 30 simple yeah

[Speaker 2]
might not be a gun but it's doing something hell yeah all right

[Speaker 1]
the nobles here um i'm just gonna get some stuff i'm just gonna uh

[Speaker 2]
it can make itself up to here before it gets hurt by anything all right that's me

[Speaker 1]
there you go uh the i have one i have one he's gonna grab one of the uh fuse the one he's gonna grab on the trebuchet and initial pieces that like he has a fuse so it could detonate over something he's gonna light it and he's just gonna kick it downwards down towards the uh barricade actually no he doesn't even have to light it he's gonna kick it down towards the barricade oh no oh no oh no oh no so after it gets lit i'm gonna go roll d6 for a week it's lit so once it gets

[Speaker 6]
here it'll go one it's yeah so it gets lit uh around there it'll be one

[Speaker 1]
three and then it'll just sit there and then explode yeah okay so i'm gonna have i'm gonna have sasuke make me a deck save uh-oh 26 makes it all right so i'm gonna have this that is have to 12 that should be sorry that should be a 30

[Speaker 3]
that is not have

[Speaker 1]
and i changed my mind that is the noble's turn two scouts are gonna they're gonna fire at that so you're in darkness that they're gonna have disadvantage on this some vague idea that you're over there i do have uh multi-tech though okay oh wow a 17 hit

[Speaker 2]
um sorry was that against me yep uh no i have an 18 ac oh shit

[Speaker 1]
all right that brings us to armoron okay armoron how far is that distance i might

[Speaker 4]
have to close it a bit nope oh well if i move uh how do i go token controls so at the very top get out of that yep there we go go there a couple pot shots at the big man here we go there we go i'll clear off my attack big money big money oh shooting again 16 16 16 will miss actually i end my turn performance anxiety that's a big guy

[Speaker 3]
there's a big guy oh boy i'll go to bed

[Speaker 1]
fire giant is gonna move in fire giant finally jesus

[Speaker 3]
does he have he is he's probably immune to fire yes i think he's gonna move straight up yeah all right here we go oh who ever would have guessed this would happen oh no there's only one hit 21 uh i will use defensive jewels to add four for that attack

[Speaker 1]
okay but i'm gonna do that once i'm gonna attack again miss no blocks he is not happy seska it's your turn all right i'm gonna attack him back with also the troops haven't moved up at this point a bunch of ammo falls down um this is also the moment at which your stuff falls down on noble is dead he is out of here the scout is dead and all those catapults are destroyed excellent as are the operators

[Speaker 3]
uh 16 to hit that doesn't hit does it from memory 16 unfortunately does not end that's all right i'll take another one 11 and then last one will be a quiet 27 to hit with the bot 27 hits the 16 damage already and that's that's done brings us to orville

[Speaker 5]
okay

[Speaker 3]
that guy's a big dude

[Speaker 2]
run myself back over here and uh start doing it again all right uh kente shot that's my bonus action that definitely is ow ow hot dog um damage then kente shot plus i'll do my key point for my death strike okay and then uh i'm gonna do it again i'm gonna get ah boo you whore uh and then yeah the shadow master will run up and start having some chomps as well

[Speaker 1]
just roll its damage for this one where were little friend 14 and uh the fire giant's laughing at like this a little like literally less than a chihuahua to it uh and then you see like a brief moment of surprise as this thing just like rips a piece of steel off of its toe fucking art it's happening i believe in you dog the target is a creature um you know what that'd be really fun all right oh no don't throw the dog don't do this all right uh scott's turn on his shadow kyla oh scott's in fire right now he's going tell me to hit the spell again yep or just do the uh the damage oh wait no i don't think there's a way that you could not kill him you'd have to roll you'd have to roll at least three ones and uh at most two twos here so that's him out of here and that brings us to armor oh god oh no that's a misfire well uh-oh now the magic of it's a magic weapon it doesn't have to worry about misfired

[Speaker 2]
oh okay sweet lame go again i wanted to be able to make fun of armor oh fucking hell

[Speaker 1]
this is brutal somebody help this man helps if the gun hits uh pass

[Speaker 3]
and went to that and on the combat tracker flight commentator uh no so good go to go to the combat tracker hit the cog to the right and set on the fight commentator and he he tells you uh when your turn's coming up okay yeah in a sec how you do it uh comment account is combat tracker yeah oh you just get it the whole time usually your turn is next your turn is next killtacular all right come on giant mate what you got you got for me

[Speaker 1]
i don't think you tried i'm trying it i can try i can try yeah plus 14 it is possible 26

[Speaker 3]
fuck um yeah it drags me into the fire um

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
speaks um do i drop concentration yeah fuck that get that shit out of here i hate this flame

[Speaker 1]
all right and then he's gonna walk with you oh god and he's going to pick up the cart that has all the little bits of um ammunition and just start letting them roll down the uh he's just going to tip them over so that they just start rolling down the way tail's gonna start wrapping around his arm i don't want him to throw me all right that's where they are right now these are the ones that have fuses on them they're not currently lit but um and they're gonna keep basically rolling every route cool all right it's his turn we come to seskia all right i'm gonna fucking uh call around his arm

[Speaker 3]
try to constrict it a bit um fuck 16 that's not gonna hit um i'm trying to just bite into it a couple times but 27 that'll hit and 29 will hit let's fucking just start mowing into him

[Speaker 6]
2021

[Speaker 3]
i'll just yeah stay he's holding on this is the poison courses into him

[Speaker 1]
all right that brings us to orville okay sasuke you can see this guy has like a wild look on his face he's just staring at like the fire nearby uh and he's going to reach for it yeah

[Speaker 2]
um let's do it again um moving down can't say shot 19 to hit the fire try 19 hits he's got an acvt how do you want to do this oh excellent just like through the back of the head coming out through one of the eyes just like splurting blood everywhere holy shit all righty turn back to armor and turn back to armor and kind of look and be like i think my bow can still serve me well perhaps the gun can wait the stone age lasted a long time

[Speaker 1]
i mean just constantly every every comment to him it's just so what was it like in the great depression depressing i bet or was just every time he goes hey it was fine

[Speaker 4]
yeah there's trains in the great depression as long as trains are around armand's fine

[Speaker 3]
because he likes trains a year who doesn't train was my first word really yeah that's awesome yeah we leave near a train track let's see here at this point

[Speaker 1]
uh one of your runners comes up to you and says that a group of your troops down the uh down the south down the next path that they were focusing on has been set upon by the assassins guild and they're having a rough time with it

[Speaker 3]
then we must save them if they cannot handle themselves perhaps they are not worthy for the

[Speaker 2]
warband there is still strength in numbers uh even if they are weak several weak can overpower one strong i am at least two or three that that that you that yes yes that you are so let us let us go and gather more and uh rush off to hell all right you guys want to take let's

[Speaker 1]
see we can go for about three hours you want to take a quick uh 20 minute break i was going to grab uh it'd be good a little bit of food yeah i can take a quick 20 minute break come on i probably

[Speaker 2]
have to probably have to wrap up a bit after that at some stage i don't know but like 20 minute break now absolutely down for it right so my plan is basically this will wrap up

[Speaker 6]
the thing uh if you want there's um if you guys if you guys are down to do like one more session of

[Speaker 1]
this um yeah then that would be like the thyrsia fight and any other memories that you wanted to go to yeah yeah no that's right okay mercy and the god

[Speaker 2]
all right see you all in 20 minutes all right hello how's it going oh to do hello hello

[Speaker 3]
hello what'd you have to eat i had uh some pizza it's pretty good nice i have pasta salad with feta and sriracha and cucumber it's good have you played trust me i'm a doctor uh no

[Speaker 1]
i was going to be like okay hello hi

[Speaker 2]
who are you card game i got for arrive for christmas

[Speaker 5]
hey yo hey all right what the fuck's going on here

[Speaker 1]
oh shit the bloody assassins there's a lot of uh bodies in the street at this point you're guys are down by about four this is there were probably about like two units here okay that's our time probably about uh two units worth here now there's about one like one and a quarter at this point your guys are giving as good as they got for the most part but the assassins are really tearing into them and they're working in pretty they're really working in concert with the scouts here pretty much anytime somebody stops defending to go after an assassin they catch an arrow all righty right now your troops at the other side are just kind of holding you guys basically took a detour down uh get to this particular account all righty with that in mind are you guys ready to begin combat ready yes let's hit it and rip it

[Speaker 5]
what yeah i didn't want to play this ask you uh yep cool i'll go i'm gonna charge over into the

[Speaker 3]
fray of this mob and just start hacking i'll go constrict on one i'll buy another and then it's flamesword the last um so we'll go constrict so attack 20 to hit on the first guy here the assassin it's a two hit it's for 12 damage and then the second assassin will get a bite 20 to hit for 23 damage and then flamesword on the last little

[Speaker 1]
for 19 on this last last all right so that will kill the scout the assassins are still up okay cool i have a thing for uh poison there are resistant to poison

[Speaker 3]
nice uh so the poison damage was 14 14 so i think 10 total plus 16 yes yes that's what's up okay this one is grappled and restrained yeah yeah and this lady is dead dead

[Speaker 2]
bringing us to orville okay i've got these ones that was that was fun hearing the uh commentator it is your tour that's good um do a little slinky do get himself up the roof again nice whoever would have guessed uh and is going to start firing at i think i'm going to go uh much further away and start firing at the assassin on the other side um already war in darkness do as i do i'm going to uh am i hidden from him you are all right so do i get advantage with that as well you do oh excellent all right so give me a little counter up huge one of the ways you could

[Speaker 1]
get counters is just by um i think you'd say that the thing spawns darkness so that just gives you

[Speaker 2]
more counters um yes that is true i can also do that it's three all right no that's right yes okay well that's the hidden one uh plus i will put in the d4 so that is 12 damage uh and i'll burn a key point for death strike all right so that's 16 off of the first one uh and then i will attack again um 16 does hit oh yes good um and with that one i will surround him with a 10 foot radius and 10 foot tall pillar of darkness um to get myself another counter uh and i will add my 1d5 1d4 to that 16 all right so 16 16 32 damage to him he is not happy and i have two counters i need to keep a track of that where it is a little piece of paper for myself excellent all right one and two and then i will have my massive boy uh am i able to let's let's just run you over here and uh you take a bite at this assassin in front of him uh i don't think i have to roll to hit from memory so it is just the damage i think uh 12 against this dude right below him uh and that'll be a me me

[Speaker 5]
already

[Speaker 3]
can you see through that

[Speaker 5]
uh

[Speaker 1]
can i or yeah can you can i see through the darkness itself yeah yeah yeah so if i if i hover over it i'll be able to see through it i thought you were asking orville orville gets

[Speaker 2]
um i've got um revelation yeah now we've we've revelation is that do i burn counters or is that get counters for doing that oh excellent okay that makes this in my head i was like oh i'm just gonna start hitting people that i'm not gonna be able to see them but

[Speaker 1]
no this is even better um also i see i never fix that thing that says hail thorns is supposed to say uh conjure conjure barrage that's a physical uh ranger spell all right so that guy took some damage that brings us to the assassins here they are going to see here he does not have an ally next to that thing so he's just gonna here features oh well 15 misses he will do it again 10 misses again already uh this guy's gonna do the same thing i'm rolling like shit all right this will find yeah they're they're gonna have a casualty adjustment but this guy is not no that's what the sneak attack is all right that guy will go step into that step into place there let's move this over to a to a body pile and we'll go over to we're just gonna focus on the guys who are attacking this one over here they're gonna attack saska this one will have disadvantage on both their attacks now look at that uh-oh all righty not a chance bro

[Speaker 3]
all right are you ill here are you resistant or immune to poison uh uh um i think it's just resistant resistant yep all right it'll take 26

[Speaker 1]
cursing damage go ahead and make me a dc 15 constitution saving throw

[Speaker 3]
that should be a little bit higher uh 10 but right um all right so instead of

[Speaker 1]
so you would take 16 but your resistance you'll take eight eight and then i take

[Speaker 3]
a 68 and then it was 22 and that's halved in hybrid form it was it was 26 22

[Speaker 5]
57 oh yuck

[Speaker 1]
those guys can't see shit so they're just gonna keep whiffing against each other these guys are gonna keep attacking the hot god ones there yeah fuck of the world but while i do that armory you are up

[Speaker 4]
you look like you're taking a bit of damage over there mr suppress uh yeah that's all right i'm

[Speaker 3]
fine i'm fine i'm fine i'm like just an average if i know right yeah all right i shoot this one

[Speaker 4]
uh that one already come on baby big money 12 or not it was a miss i take it going again 25 that's what we were after 23 magical piercing damage

[Speaker 1]
he's not looking so good he just kind of jerks and you see a big old red stain appear off his back step one check is anything good i can do as a bonus action

[Speaker 4]
um i don't have two open fighting oh guardian yeah guardian armor defensive field i'll give myself 12

[Speaker 1]
tempage but oh sick yeah there you go you don't all right is that the end of your turn yep thank you it's good uh one of these scouts is going to move away sesuke gets an attack of opportunity yeah we'll lash out with um i have the sword other one attack uh armor and oh nat 20

[Speaker 3]
come on 33

[Speaker 1]
i literally cut in half and no the guts even spill out because it's because it just gets cauterized it's like oh i gotta fucking and that 20 on our room grand total of 12 damage there goes your temp uh it's a good use of a bonus session it was he's that every time all right i got a few more

[Speaker 4]
scouts to go yeah i was just i was just saving it up until now i didn't really need it now i do yeah that's sick i've got so many uses of that too with guardian armor

[Speaker 3]
holy shit all right he's gonna have another three

[Speaker 1]
fuck yeah this is gonna make two longbow attacks versus the dog um i don't want you to worry about his hip points right actually i'm gonna say his hip points is something reserved right now it's your love level 10 20 out of 20 no orzoi uh the second guy they have to beat a total of 20 if they get over 20 damage he's just going to be quote knocked out of the fight he could still move and do shit like that he just can't attack until either the fight's over or he's healed all right so that one's a miss all right so for instance he's just that basically they wouldn't get past it still move around and uh all that good stuff oh shit this one's gonna okay the thing and these guys are gonna pull further back they can't actually see anything right oh no no they're gonna move further in actually they gotta close the distance and these ones are gonna knock out another hobgoblin i'm going to the meantime we're just gonna roll as if these are everything that's a melee with them so this one's gonna get knocked and those guys will take some extra damage oh as do these ones it's gonna move up yeah nice start reinforcing saskia

[Speaker 3]
all right that brings us to saskia all right the fellow that i've got restrained i'm just gonna bite down on him so advantage 28 to hit 21 damage he's got resistant to poison so 16 damage on this fella how's he looking

[Speaker 1]
um save something there there we go all right 16 damage on the guy that you have

[Speaker 3]
restrained all right i'll keep going if i need to he does have a little bit more yeah all right i'll give him another one 25 five four two six eight ten damage

[Speaker 1]
all right he is surprisingly still up fuck all right i'm just gonna

[Speaker 3]
squeeze him constrict him this fucking guy's gone down uh fuck 13 to hit what the fuck he's rolled two into one holy shit uh so just sort of stare menacingly into his eyes as he's a bit of blood pumping through a bit of a poison pumping through his veins

[Speaker 1]
he's definitely not happy right now you can try to escape

[Speaker 2]
but there is no chance oh that's saskia's turn

[Speaker 1]
all right orville you're up next

[Speaker 2]
okie dokie uh gonna use revelation to see the uh people in the darkness uh and i believe i get three counters because i reveal creatures uh you reveal

[Speaker 1]
yep you get three counters fuck yeah excellent and it doesn't affect your uh action economy or anything like that

[Speaker 2]
okie dokie uh and then uh would we say i'm hidden from them because yep okay excellent i am going to fire off uh against the one that i'm targeting uh the main one that i shot the last time

[Speaker 1]
cuckoo all right you have advantage on all these attacks

[Speaker 2]
there's a 32 uh i'm not entirely sure well other than i like i know it's about

[Speaker 1]
oh what does the word mean yeah it was it was a corruption of a few different words nice there's something about a crow demon

[Speaker 2]
okay what do we got here 15 plus 8 plus 20 that's our 37 damage to uh that assassin dead excellent um the shadow mastiff was uh not doing well so i think that will be me i'll move over and uh yeah in turn

[Speaker 5]
i was gone for a sec is james dead

[Speaker 3]
he might be i'm gonna eat this little dude i'm getting them style i've got um lack in regeneration after when i'm below 56 health it's not much rad but it's good it's handy i had a bunch of features i figured how to use

[Speaker 4]
your armor at six oh yeah

[Speaker 3]
yeah all your little inventions and shit you can probably have like how many um

[Speaker 1]
attunement slots you got at this stage or all of them

[Speaker 2]
all right over the second turn uh yes i fired off um pretty sure my mastiff is oh my mastiff's good oh man i might have missed this why does my mastiff have a token on it you got his nose ah that's right that's why well he can move but he's not like yeah i might get him to doodle and then that'll be me

[Speaker 1]
go go go kill all right anyways uh so a rogue gentleman comes out recognizes a soother zachariah who is the lord of this fair town a slum who who first insulted you called you and me a bandit he will die well now fitting what bandits will do to one another seems low lives have a use disposing of other low lives oh

[Speaker 2]
i am trying to think as to how this memory may have been corrupted or interfered with um that wasn't that shit that wasn't that dude that'd be oh yes that wasn't it um it's valid but that makes it fun um you know what i think would be helpful in this situation the uh a like notable member of the uh assassins guild is here uh who i had uh met with and paid off uh earlier and i was waiting for him to join the fight okay well i mean so i guess my idea is is that uh the the memory has been corrupted somehow and the original memory was that uh oval had corrupted or like paid off a group like within the assassins i guess like a subgroup right somebody who hasn't shown up yet yeah to to join the fight with him uh and he remembers that this guy was here for the fight against utir so the fact that he isn't here his memories have been played with okay that i can work with want me uh want me an ally out it's the guy i've currently got wrapped in my tail i'm fighting and killing yeah i'm like oh wait no one no one no stop

[Speaker 5]
what are you doing bitch is that you

[Speaker 4]
it's a deadpool his eyes pop out of his head like one of those old like potato toys

[Speaker 1]
i'm going to use one time on this character one of bar's characters i'm going to bring up fix there's a there's a character in the deadpool comics that's just called hydra bob

[Speaker 2]
he keeps bumping into this saint hydra henchman and he's like oh bob bob

[Speaker 1]
what are you doing buddy oh this is uh this is convenient timing here

[Speaker 2]
i'm gonna have bix go first yeah down from hidden excellent this is my shadows of mordor moment

[Speaker 1]
i'm like haha oh yeah nice a little trade so actually she's going to uh she's gonna shoot downwards also shadows of mordor is is kind of how i imagine the majority of the the area the majority of your war band going it's just occasional betrayals and people fucking up why do you keep doing this it's he's surprised or doesn't get a reaction

[Speaker 2]
otherwise he would shield random voiced by uh camille non-gianni and just keeps showing up oh it was great it was just also like oh like here i am fighting at all i want another game like it it's like ah hang on take it out of the moment but that's the dude from silicon valley

[Speaker 5]
kill kill

[Speaker 1]
that's so this was supposed to kill him dead for it yeah just transferring damage over uh so some of the damage gets transferred over to you oh yeah shield guardian thing hey there we go what else oh okay this is she's an assassin i need to fix so i need to roll

[Speaker 3]
more damage just double it all just double it all just double double double six probably six

[Speaker 4]
actually the assassin uh yeah because the creeps actually triple after they double yes yeah exactly and then if she gets to level 20 then they quadruple then they triple then they

[Speaker 1]
double i gotcha right that's what we're missing really all right so i'm learning crazy capstone um uh let's back him down this guy is going to use the that's right i have a change of music

[Speaker 6]
which was

[Speaker 1]
here we go I know he's going to cast the stoneskin on himself, be a smartass or whatever.

[Speaker 2]
Motherfucker.

[Speaker 1]
ChillGuardian in the meantime is going to go and miss I guess, he missed twice. Oh boy, it's all like the crap that clearly hasn't been maintained in a while. All right, the assassins are up.

This guy is going to suffer an attack of opportunity to move over to Armourin. This guy's gonna suffer another two attacks of opportunity in order to move over to Armourin. A lot of aggression there, okay.

[Speaker 4]
He just caught my bad line, it was all that was I really did.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god, okay that one hits. And then the other guy. Also, this is a go-ahead maybe a constitution saving throw to see 15.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's Armourin, yep, got this.

[Speaker 1]
Nice, very good. All right, you will take 16. Half of the poison damage.

All right, so you take 16 piercing and instead of 31, you take...

[Speaker 3]
Oh Jesus, these fucking poisons, it's rough.

[Speaker 1]
It's pretty bad. I rolled almost double what I did for the first. Yeah, how's Armourin doing?

[Speaker 4]
Hey, he's still above half health, I haven't lost that much. That's all good. This guy's gonna attack with a...

[Speaker 1]
He can't be healed if he wants, we totally want to kill him. All right, so make me a save for poison there.

[Speaker 3]
Saskia?

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Same thing, I just don't know why it's not including...

[Speaker 1]
It should be in the chat box, if you select yourself it'll go over there.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there should be an extra four in there, it's not adding like the modifier.

[Speaker 1]
There's like a space between the plots, do you see that?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, 17. Like it looks fine on, it says correct saving throw on the sheet, but then when it rolls it doesn't. So yeah, 17.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you take nine piercing, you quarter the poison down to four, and then you get an additional 14 piercing. Which I have, because I am a Lycan-esque creature.

[Speaker 3]
32, I'm still fucking hurting down there, holy shit. Hard. I'm gonna block, I'm gonna shield, like wait, how many is my action?

Nope, yeah, I still have it, so I will block that 22.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
With um, what's it called? Fighting star? There it is, the first duelist.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, that's it. This guy's gonna do... Assuming it worked, yeah.

I know that I lost connection to the server, because the thing I clicked on 60 times didn't do anything. There we go. It's...

East. So this guy's gonna get A and then... This guy's gonna get together.

And the other guys over there are still whiffing on each other, so they got nothing. Auburn, it is your turn. Go, go, go.

[Speaker 4]
Gonna have a quick look through my spellbook, see what I've got. Let's hit with the flamework. Yeah, I'm gonna...

What shadow is that? 10-foot radius spear. Oh, it's probably not gonna be that good.

That'll be all right. I've got the gauntlets I can use. I use those.

Sorry, for some reason a couple of my items disappeared from last time I played. I had a custom thunder gauntlet, but uh... Thunder gauntlets.

Melee deals 1d8 damage.

[Speaker 3]
And... Don't forget your flash of genius.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, plus 5. 1d8 plus 5. I thought that'd scale up a bit over time, but it has not.

I've got flash of genius for like saving throws and stuff. Yeah. Doesn't seem necessary yet.

Which means I've forgotten to start a mid-combat. I'm gonna hit these two fuckers and the things here. I'll try and hit all three of those in a line with a lightning bolt.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, nice. Oh, righty-o.

[Speaker 4]
If he 20-dex saves from...

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna hit him from that angle. Yeah. If you draw out.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's trying to just do it sideways for me. Oh, I'll make it.

[Speaker 1]
So one success. The success will take anything, but the...

[Speaker 4]
27 lightning will halve to the success.

[Speaker 1]
That guy's gonna use evasion to take nothing. The other guy will use evasion to not die and instead take half. And then these two scouts are both dead.

[Speaker 4]
That's right. Bonus action, give myself 12 10-page pay. That's the end of my turn, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my lord. Swatching out. Cavity get emptied.

[Speaker 1]
Tooth. Fuck that. I think the scout's still up.

There's like one scout still up. She's gonna make an attack with her gear. Nine damage, if that hits Saskia.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Um, how do I do this? Four damage.

[Speaker 1]
These guys are gonna just focus down the... This hobgoblin here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, definitely looking a little rough here.

[Speaker 1]
These guys still can't see shit. They're just fumbling around in the dark. That brings us to Saskia.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I'm fucking crushing this twat in...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I'm gonna kill you. Wait a second, uh, they're gonna kill that guy for you. Oh yes, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Callum says Saskia's not happy with that, but... All right, um, so I get four health back at the start of the turn because of regen. So I'll take that.

Redirect to 42. Then I need to make a fucking wisdom saving throw. Uh, which is plus five.

17, we're sweet. I don't go on a bloodlust yet. Um, and she will flick tail at this guy.

The... Oh no, fuck it, let's just gank this dude. Gank this.

Gank him. They do bad damage, I don't like them. Using poison, it's weak.

Uh, 22 to hit and he'll be grappled for 12 damage as I sort of wrap my tail around him. Um, and then just start to bite into him again.

[Speaker 5]
All righty.

[Speaker 3]
Two bites, that's a crit. Oh shoot. For 37.

Uh, so the 12 is, that's half, so it's not that. It's 12, 18, 25 damage.

[Speaker 1]
And then... It literally has one hit point left. Wait, no, it doesn't because of the damage from the other guys.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well then the last, the last attack I'll use on... The fella that's over here then.

[Speaker 1]
And a twink.

[Speaker 3]
A little twink. And from run over. Um, 26 to hit him for 24 damage.

Um, and then I'll look to the hobgoblins, um... And I'll say, um... Get away from me!

And I'll sort of back up. Because if they're near me, well, I'm in a bloodlust, I'll tear them apart.

[Speaker 1]
They know to follow orders.

[Speaker 3]
I just sort of start to slink back a bit. That's it.

[Speaker 1]
Why is it repeating? This one, this one's annoying. All right, that brings us to Orville.

Orville.

[Speaker 2]
Do do do do do do. Uh, I reckon... What have I got fighting me out here?

I think I'm going to start trying to take some shots at... Voltia. Um...

Darkness. I'm going to take the bonus action for a Kensei shot.

[Speaker 1]
Plus I'll do a Ki point for extra, and then I'll do it again. Alright, let's see here. Stoneskin does not block against magic weapons.

He's very pissed off because you didn't have one when you actually fought him. And he was, quote, aware of this beforehand. There's no idea why you're able to hurt him now.

Such a big beach.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so that is 24 plus 41 damage to him.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, so he takes 20.

[Speaker 1]
This guy also takes 20.

[Speaker 2]
And on the second hit, I will conjure up a little... I'm going to surround him with a 10-foot pillar of darkness.

[Speaker 6]
Excellent.

[Speaker 1]
Minus those hobgoblins that are stuck in the darkness.

[Speaker 2]
They're like, what the fuck's going on?

[Speaker 1]
I think they're aware of it at this point. Because they're part of the warband. They're part of your, quote, real warband.

So they know to just puddle in there. Like, alright, if we get covered by darkness, just literally just sit here. Because the boss is going to pick off as many people as he can.

[Speaker 3]
The boss is working on it.

[Speaker 1]
Every once in a while, one of them gives a thumbs up. Well, I guess they're hobgoblins, so they give a salute.

[Speaker 2]
They just look in the general direction.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, good stuff, guys. Awesome. And then, honestly, that's me.

I'm just going to keep it simple.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Vix is going to target one of the assassins here. First he's going to hide his bonus action.

And she has advantage. Cloak of All Mankind. Perfect.

Yep. I've got advantage. That hits.

Bonus 46. He came back. That's first damage that I cast against a guard.

[Speaker 3]
Goddamn it. Those fucking assassins.

[Speaker 5]
She has bonus 43.

[Speaker 1]
She's going to add the 9 from me. That brings us to Uther. He's going to move out of the darkness here.

He's going to have his shield guardian moved out for obvious reasons. He's going to put Mirror Image on himself. A little temporary benefit.

And then he's going to have the shield guardian run over and attempt to pummel this guy.

[Speaker 2]
Fucking get him.

[Speaker 1]
Get him, bro.

[Speaker 5]
Fuck him up, Kenneth. I'm Kenny. I killed Kenny.

You bastards.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Omarin.

[Speaker 5]
It will be your turn, Kenneth.

[Speaker 1]
That's me.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to risk an opportunity attack. And go and head down a bit. From that assassin.

Is he taking an opportunity attack or is that one still up?

[Speaker 1]
This guy? Yeah. He will attempt it.

Nope.

[Speaker 3]
Good.

[Speaker 1]
Bang, bang, bang.

[Speaker 4]
Bang, bang, bang. This one's going to be a big hit. Bang, bang, bang.

I've got temp HP. I'm going to use telekinetic shove on the big guy. Push him back 5 feet into the darkness.

Trick save. Yeah, strength save. DC is light.

Let me just double check it. I think it's like 17 or something. Telekinetic shove.

Yep, 17 strength save.

[Speaker 1]
Hits 4. Let's see here. What the fuck?

Alright. Is this against Uther?

[Speaker 4]
No, that's the shield guardian guy. Alrighty. I'm going to make a strength save.

A real bonehole one. He's going to roll like I have. Yeah!

Go back 5 feet. You're in the dark now. His hand isn't, but his eyes are.

And that's the most important thing. That is the most important thing.

[Speaker 2]
That's what counts.

[Speaker 4]
My turn, please.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. Scouts are just going to...

That's fine. Armin, you will have the opportunity to make an attack of opportunity.

[Speaker 4]
Great.

[Speaker 6]
I'll just go and do... Oh, I can use an opportunity attack to cast a spell.

[Speaker 4]
Because I took war caster.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, fuck yeah.

[Speaker 4]
What spells have I got? Sorry boys, I am a bit slow this afternoon. This is why I don't play spell casters.

[Speaker 3]
Dog shit.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's the way I'm rolling these imaginary dice. That's really fucking me.

[Speaker 3]
Can you Thunderwave as they go past? As they all go past, poof. I could shatter.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. Something happened with my spells. I'll just use a shatter on them.

[Speaker 3]
Go into the casting tunnel with one action. Unless I need to target that creature. Oh, I can't use...

I could do, like, shock and grasp.

[Speaker 4]
Shock and grasp.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, shock and grasp will do. Perfect.

[Speaker 4]
I already did a shock and grasp. And attack. That's going to be a 30.

[Speaker 3]
That's better. What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
How the fuck does that work? What the fuck is going on?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but then there's another extra 7 on that. That's based off your intelligence modifier. True.

[Speaker 1]
You've got proficiency potential.

[Speaker 4]
Something seems wild there, I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
You got a natural 50, you hit. So...

[Speaker 4]
Alright, and damage is going to be a big number like that, right?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 3]
That's very middle of the road. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
3 to 8, getting a 12. That's three fours.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Yeah, I can't find... I seem to remember something about the Thunder Gauntlet, but I can't seem to find the...

[Speaker 4]
I've got like a macro... Yeah, I don't know what. I probably made like a dodgy thing and...

It's been a little while. It might have just got lost in translation somewhere. I had like a thermic cutter as well.

I've got two macros linked up.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 4]
They go to things that don't connect to anything anymore.

[Speaker 1]
Right, it's weird because they're not inside your... The copy I have of your sheet for the compendium.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't know. I probably stuffed something up there at some point, honestly.

[Speaker 3]
Um, yeah, it doesn't look like...

[Speaker 4]
Not real good with foundry yet.

[Speaker 3]
But, you know, if you ask a nice DM.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and the Hobgoblins are going to start bringing us here.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, there it is.

[Speaker 1]
12, scout's going to be toast. Nice. Alright, and you notice the scouts in here finally get, um...

Get murked. Basically, they take the signal of the number of deaths that they hear. Just wipe everybody out.

[Speaker 6]
Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Back upstairs, we come back to Saskria. Oh, these guys are going to be awesome. My turn?

[Speaker 5]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this is Saskria. Fuck em up!

[Speaker 3]
I need to do a wisdom save to avoid... Biting my head off. 4k.

[Speaker 4]
Might just be my internet, but your voice cut out just as you answered. Need to do a wiz...

[Speaker 3]
Need to do a wisdom save.

[Speaker 4]
Um... I need to do a pistom, I mean a beatem, I mean...

[Speaker 3]
We'll keep fighting, we'll keep fighting. We might just give you a bit of a look that tells you I'm loopy soon. Oh god.

I need some health. Ah, and I'll attack these two fellas on the left.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think Romerun's ever seen a bloodhunter. He'll start skipping out, he won't even know.

[Speaker 5]
That's a fucking snake!

[Speaker 3]
26. Constrict it on this guy, and then I'll bite him. And at 20, get that in you little fucker.

[Speaker 4]
Fuck, you've been hitting some crit. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'm figuring out what a 20 looks like. Press T on the guy that you're attacking right now. Ah, this guy.

[Speaker 3]
That one, okay. So constrict it on him, and then... So that is 9 damage from the constrict, and then...

23 halves, what... 11... 26...

17... 16... 23 damage...

From the bite. And then if I need to bite again, I'll bite again.

[Speaker 1]
If your next attack will kill him. Honestly, I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
We'll do it. 20... I'm just making sure to hit.

Oh yeah. Bite his head off. Jesus.

That's not good for him. It's easy. Marshals, man.

Just fucking... Just leave. It's a benefit.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's a damage. I've missed playing Nero for the last 6 months.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Tibalt was easy. It's just like, he's a runt. But it's actually...

Give them a shot. Give them a shot. Oh yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I back in your Marshal characters. I thought Lant and James the Server was fucking brilliant.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it was fun. He was a druid though. Yeah.

But like a... Was Flint a druid?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I played him less like a druid and more just like... Oh, was he a druid?

[Speaker 1]
So Flint was a druid, but he was like... He was flavoured as an elemental guy who just got fucked up by Medusa. Yeah, Medusa, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So he's just in tune with stone. So all of his spells are stone-based. And then when he transforms into an animal, it's like a stone animal.

I love it. And then Ultan was not a druid. He was a bard.

He was a very, very druidy bard.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's why I thought Ultan was a druid.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. But yeah, anyway, turns out awful.

[Speaker 2]
Okey-dokey.

[Speaker 4]
Ultan was an inspiring cold leader. He was a successful cold leader.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm going to fire shit off at Old Mate again. Because why not?

Because he's a fuckwit. He's an absolute fuckwit. Bonus action for the...

[Speaker 4]
Absolute cockhead.

[Speaker 2]
That's 20 to hit. 20 hits. That is 9 damage.

And then I'm going to erupt a shadow around him again. And then I'm going to attack him, but now I get advantage. Because he's covered on 22.

Still, that's a hit. 9 plus... He gets the d4.

Plus, I'll give it... d8. Oh god.

Not doing too great on the old damages here. 9, 18, 22... 26 damage to Uhia.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
How many counters do you have on your boat at this point? What was that? I think I had 5.

Then...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well, hang on. That would have been 5. That would have been 6.

That would have been 7. Which then would have gone up to 10. Because I would have used...

Sorry, I meant to say... Revelation, so that I could see him before I've... Shot at him again.

[Speaker 1]
You could pop off the big one next round.

[Speaker 2]
What did we say the big one was again?

[Speaker 1]
The big one is Conjure... Conjure Volley. Actually, you would have been able to do it, I think, this round.

If you had 5. Oh, I'm ready. I don't think...

He can't Counterspell, because he's in the... Go for Bites. I will...

[Speaker 2]
Use that next turn. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Bix.

[Speaker 3]
Damn, Bix.

[Speaker 1]
Bix is going to attack... Shoot the Assassin over there after... Hi, Bix.

What's he doing over there? Well, I had a bad... It doesn't matter.

He wins. What is he doing over there? Oh, shit, that was...

Wait, why is it only plus 4? That should be... Okay, that's...

That should be an 18. Why is it only plus 4 for something that has... This is fucked up.

This is fucked up here. There's a lightning beam over there. Uther is just going to fire off a...

A coat of cold here. He doesn't know what to fucking do. Like, ah!

Alright. That would be assassinated. Alright, I need armor up, and...

Tusk to make me safe. Alright. Oh, wait, no, I wasn't rolling for the...

Pop Goblin, okay. Ooh, man.

[Speaker 3]
Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
That's not good.

[Speaker 1]
That's a really... That's the best I've rolled all night.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
Trigus.

[Speaker 4]
The assassins... Trigus for armor and two. Fuck.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I think that's the last of the assassins that's gone. Oh, wait, no, not the last of the assassins. Almost the last of the assassins.

Oh, wait. Oh, this one's definitely... That one's also definitely dead.

Jesus. Jesus. Okay, so we have...

Shield Guardian. And... Okay, he's just gonna have to pull back.

This guy... Alright, and then we come to the top of the round. Wait, no, no, no.

It is... It is Omorin's. One second.

Ah! There we go. I can do this myself.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, this gun's gonna hit this... LTE bastard this time. I've had so many misses.

That means I'm guaranteed a crit right here, right? I believe... 24?

Hit... It does. Beautiful.

21 damage off of that one.

[Speaker 6]
Magical piercing.

[Speaker 1]
Takes half, and the Shield Guardian also takes... Gets the split damage. That Shield Guardian's not doing good.

20 hits.

[Speaker 4]
20 as well on the second shot. Wait! 23, baby!

Bonus action. Gonna give myself 12 temp HP. Which is...

12 thirteenths of my current HP total.

[Speaker 1]
That Shield Guardian literally has one hit point left. You see? Oh, it doesn't have the immunity, so I thought I did.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's a Hobgoblin's turn. One of those ones can hit it from the darkness.

[Speaker 1]
Just swing. Alright, well, that's enough.

[Speaker 4]
Stomp on its toes.

[Speaker 1]
Do something. 1 HP. All you gotta do is make him go, ah!

A bunch of these guys literally just bum rush it, and just knock it over, start wailing on it.

[Speaker 3]
That's what you want. So I can't see in this darkness, can I?

[Speaker 1]
You are aware, thanks to... Orville. Revelation.

[Speaker 3]
I will... Oh, hang on. I get 4 health back.

Did that heal me? Nope, but it's still good. And then I need to do a Wisdom save to avoid killing everyone.

We fine. And I will charge in to the darkness and start... Fucking going ballistic, mate.

Grab him with my tail. Slam his head into the ground. Uh, does he...

So can I see, can he not see? He can not see at the moment. 25 hit.

What? For 12 damage. And then I'm just going to start biting into him.

Do it, do it, do it. I should have, I should have. And...

27 hit. This is good damage.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, how do you want to do this?

[Speaker 3]
Ah, just, you just see like splatters of blood just... Pull out and like fly out of the darkness. Um, and then she'll sort of...

Like you see her drag... Drag him just out under a building, just sort of like... Feasting.

Um... Trying to keep some distance between everyone else. Because I'm going to have to keep doing Wisdom saves until...

I come back to normal, back to full health. Not full health.

[Speaker 4]
Get above your threshold.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 5]
Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you guys are returned back to... Let's see here. Uh, some of your troops are unfortunately...

Expired. I got a little fucked up. But usually about like...

If you win a battle about two-thirds of your casualties can be recovered. It's just like people who went down. And folks who need a little bit of healing.

So definitely a little bit of mourning for the dead. But you come back. The town of Orton is...

Now the closest it's ever been. It is close enough to open the gate, should you guys wish. We were talking about ending it about here.

It is currently oriented towards Therese's Spire. Which you have not seen before. It is this massive construction of ice and...

It's not even a construction of ice, it's a construction of light. It just looks like the Aurora Borealis. It's kind of mixed in with a bunch of plant life.

And like arctic ferns and stuff like that. Previously invisible with a big... There are eyes composed of ice.

They kind of look like a clam's eyes almost. Just dotting this... Very tall structure.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys want to do this again sometime. We can do more memories. And you can use it to change.

Or we can jump straight in. Or some mix of both. Happy to do it.

[Speaker 3]
Next one is just jumping into this fucking Ganka. Yeah, I would do that.

[Speaker 1]
How long would you reckon that would take you? It's like a multi-encounter thing. Because there's the green god and there's Therese's separately.

Spoiler. Spoiler for something you'll find out in about probably two minutes. As a reward for the conquest though.

You guys all level up. Hell yeah. Very good.

Mark down one extra hand. Well... I...

I'm going to jump off Foundry.

[Speaker 2]
I've had a great time. I am still a little hungover. But that's life.

But thanks for running James. Hey, thanks for coming back. I'm going to hop off.

Chat to everyone at some stage later.

[Speaker 1]
Bye bye. Hey, what time is it over there? It's 10.15. Well, that's not too bad. I got plenty of time. Specifically, I want to get some chores done. I want to go buy some groceries before the Tom Thumb down the road closes.

[Speaker 5]
That's true.

[Speaker 1]
See you guys later.

[Speaker 5]
Catch you, mate.

[Speaker 6]
It went pretty good. It was a lot of fun. Basically playing through somebody's memories.

Which was a bit of fun. Combination of like... I don't know...

Over a year's worth of Tom Thumb. Before the gameplay. These guys have been...

I think like... A couple of times. I played with them in other Westmark.

Oh, good. Yeah. Come here.

Meow. Come here. Jazzy.

Uh oh. What's up? Scratching his belly.

He's like... And it's just like... Sat down on it.

What? Pressure though. Check it out.

Oh! Oh! He's dead.

Stop! What? I'm on your big spot.

He's looking for you. Kiki. That was your message for you.

That's it. Hey! Razor's not supportive.

Come here. What? Come here.

There you go. There you go. Come here.

There you go. Come here. Come here.

He knew! Right. By a hoot.

Well, I'm getting paper towels. I'm not getting the... Well, do you want zero out of one?

No, I'm getting... I was just about to say... Dad?

What did I... Get? You get a little bit...

Dishwasher. And? Anything else you're looking for?

Did they leave enough of that liquid? What? Hulk?

Hulk? Hulk? Hulk?

Hulk? Hulk? Hulk?

Hulk? Hulk? Hulk?

Hulk? Hulk? Hulk?

[Landie (Nova)]
Okay, of the time where clink died like, yeah, we're fighting a really strong creature, but I think, um, Frogratha and Robin both spent like two rounds not helping, which meant clink died. Nova was really upset about that. Holy shit, James is in a wind tunnel.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hello! James is the obnoxious noisemaker now.

[Referee (James)]
Now he's muted. It's fun when he's the obnoxious noisemaker. What's up, Rosie?

What do you want? What's up? Off of my chair.

Off of my chair. Yeah, Lena, off. Off.

Nope, nope, nope, no password. It's off. No password?

Oh, yeah, she wanted me to give a password to get into my chair.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Rude.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yes, so I said no password and he dragged her off. My chair. They're obsessed with my chair and they're being jerks about it.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, how about now? Now.

[Landie (Nova)]
Holy shit.

[Referee (James)]
What do you mean?

[Landie (Nova)]
James was talking like, the way you spoke, it sort of sounded like God speaking.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, that was crazy. That was. Same.

Hey Google, you're watching it. Cool, okay. I guess we're not watching it anymore.

Wouldn't they rather listen to the music over watch the movie? I mean, that's fair.

[Landie (Nova)]
Skip to the good parts.

[Referee (James)]
No, thank you, Rosie. Stop. Yeah, Lena, that's.

What? What? You're sad.

Very, very sad. What? You have a sad sick.

Oh, okay. Yeah. You're listening to it right now.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
This is what it's gonna be.

[Speaker 9]
Hey.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hey, you were watching the movie, you couldn't watch it there but you put it on the Google Hub so now we're listening to it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Did you enter with a frog sound?

[Referee (James)]
What? No, you're crazy.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yes. Okay. I haven't turned off so I heard nothing but that was fun.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I initially have those turned on but I did not hear anything.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Have what turned on? You have a special thing that just. What?

[Landie (Nova)]
You can set a discord soundboard sound to play when you join a chat.

[Speaker 8]
Oh my God, that's so cool.

[Frogitha]
I only have it for like the next month and then my Nitro free trial runs out.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ah, you need it with Nitro, okay, that makes sense. Still, very cool. I love that.

It did start to move slightly. I thought I was slightly losing my mind.

[Landie (Nova)]
Frogatha's just becoming more frog each passing day.

[Frogitha]
I'm thinking about making an actual Pathfinder character named Frogatha Christie V and then going with it.

[Referee (James)]
We shall see.

[Speaker 8]
Who's everyone bringing? It's a high level so I'm assuming, I mean Mimosa's going to be there because this is something she promised that she would help with.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I have level 4.

[Frogitha]
Cerys and Siren are level 4.

[Referee (James)]
You may die.

[Frogitha]
I may die so I'm bringing Cerys because I think it would be fitting.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That is fitting because they were going to try to kill one of y'all.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, you know, it was his turn at first and now she's taking his place.

[Speaker 8]
What, Yelena?

[Frogitha]
I could bring both and just lose two characters at once. Let's see, where is my thingy?



[Speaker 8]
There we go. I still have to make a folder for Scooter so I don't have to have custody of his fucking character.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, I just made the event real quick.

[Speaker 8]
An event? I almost, I was so close to giving it away. Almost.

[Frogitha]
I need to get Arsonist Goblin up to level 3. Oh look, Arsonist Goblin is level 3. I can bring them.

Arsonist Goblin.

[Referee (James)]
Arson-ish.

[Frogitha]
Hey Google, off. Their actual name is Kneeback but Arsonist Goblin. You can't stop me.

I will not be silenced. I did, you know how I made that little foundry Google sheet, right?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Technically, there's three characters that technically go against the no A rule.

[Speaker 8]
Three?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Who are the other two?

[Speaker 8]
Four? Who are the other three?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Alright, so technically, Vera has a character named A-Ranger. Which is very silly. Landy has Autogym.

And there's an unorganized character named Emerica D.

[Speaker 8]
Estan. Those are the other three characters who technically...

[Referee (James)]
I don't think that character ever played. Jim hasn't debuted yet.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Exactly. Technically, those characters haven't played except for Ranger. I think, I do not know why it says A-Ranger rather than Ranger Ranger.

[Landie (Nova)]
That's because I was calling him Ranga. I don't know how popular of a term it is in America, but here that's what you call a person with red hair.

[Referee (James)]
Is it a slur?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Not really.

[Landie (Nova)]
Ranga. R-A-N-G-A.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I'd never heard that term before, so I thought you were just making a silly name pronunciation. A silly slur.

[Landie (Nova)]
The main thing was that Ver knew what it meant, and he felt ashamed, so he changed it to A-Ranger.

[Referee (James)]
That doesn't seem... if it were a slur, that would make it better.

[Landie (Nova)]
Most people are like, yeah, that's not a slur, but if you talk to some poor redhead child who's been bullied for it, they're like, yeah, it's the worst thing you could possibly call me. Usually by the time you're an adult, it's affectionate to call you a Ranga, because you've been broken by being called it. Like, my older brother has red hair, and he is affectionately a Ranga.

[Frogitha]
My neighbors growing up were Catholic, and I think they made up at least 60% of the redhead population.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, look, there's your balloon.

[Landie (Nova)]
Maybe it's just a Catholic thing, because I am also Catholic. The only time I'm Catholic, though, is at work. Well, I'm bald, so it could be any color these days, so, who knows.



[Referee (James)]
Dope Irish.

[Landie (Nova)]
I shave my head, Duke. Avoid being redhead.

[Speaker 9]
Oh no!

[Landie (Nova)]
I wish I had my brother's red hair, because he has a really strong head of hair, because it comes from my pop side. My mother's side of the family. I got my dad's hairline, so all male pattern baldness in their 20s.

[Referee (James)]
That's when mine started.

[Landie (Nova)]
But I have a good beard, at least. My head's a good shape for it, so I got the jeans for that. Brother, you can't say that and have, like, the most luscious head of hair like I've ever seen.

[Referee (James)]
First of all, it's still thinning back here, and I can still see a little bit of my scalp back here. It's not falling back. But second of all, it's because I got on meds, and it was a very difficult flight.

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah, that's fair.

[Speaker 9]
I always see...

[Landie (Nova)]
I always see. I should probably stop derailing the session, but I always... I get posts now on Reddit about...

It's like... Balding Reddit. It's all these guys are posting, like, is it over for me?

And it's a picture of their scalp. And there's the smallest hint of hair loss. And people in the comments are like, yep, time to shave.

[Referee (James)]
Oh no! So there's r slash hair loss, and then r slash tresses. Because apparently your tresses are hair.

It's a funny word for hair or something like that. And so that's, like, the advanced subreddit. I stay up to date on that one.

[Landie (Nova)]
I got introduced to a new one. It was about systems. Which is, like, what people call toupees and stuff now.

Yeah! Like, some of them are really good. And then I saw one guy who posted...

The reason I saw the subreddit was one of them broke containment. Because this guy posted about his system. And how some child came and pulled his hat off and was calling him bald.

You gotta kill that kid. But his hair did look very Kandall-esque. So people gave him a bunch of tips.

And a day later he came back and was like, his system looked great. But that's brutal to have a child come up and call you bald. You're obviously insecure about it if you've got a system.

[Referee (James)]
And you're hiding it like that.

[Frogitha]
I have a gift for this, hold on.

[Referee (James)]
You gotta have something scary that you draw on your head. To discourage someone.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Good job, good job.

[Frogitha]
There's a Spongebob meme for everything.

[Referee (James)]
What's the worst thing that you could show a child? Like, that you drew on your scalp, if they grab your... If they grab your barrel.

Goatee?

[Referee (James)]
No, no. Eye heart.

[Landie (Nova)]
There's one guy who had like a temporary tattoo with the words Eye heart eating shit on his forehead for like a joke and he couldn't get it off and it's the funniest shit to me.

[Referee (James)]
Do that, but eye heart eating children.

[Referee (James)]
Am I really gonna post an eye funny link?

[Referee (James)]
Is that the best I've come up with? That's totally fine. I've been putting it up with my girlfriend for like 4 years.

[Speaker 9]
That's the best I've got.

[Referee (James)]
That's fine.

[Landie (Nova)]
I don't use TikTok, so anytime I try to look at a TikTok... Ah, that's not even the original. Oh, you know what you need to do?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Linking on TikTok sucks.

[Referee (James)]
You just need to like... Yeah, linking to TikTok really sucks. You need to put on your...

On your forehead. If you read this, you're gay. And that's like the worst thing you can do to a child.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You're assuming that kid can read.

[Landie (Nova)]
Well, he's safe then.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
If he can't read, he's safe. You're expecting way too much of a chance. If they're just pulling your hat off and then calling you bald, they're probably not able to read.

They're probably small enough that they're like...

[Referee (James)]
No, because they know how funny it is to like pull my hair out. They know.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
No, that still doesn't mean anything, because my kids at Newboard were like, this is fun, let me pull your hair out. Cool.

[Referee (James)]
They didn't know how fun it was. Yes, they did. There's no way.

[Speaker 9]
It's impossible.

[Speaker 8]
They absolutely did.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
And then when Yelena was a baby, her comfort was pulling my hair. So around my head, there were little baby hairs that had to grow back when she was done.

[Referee (James)]
Oh my God. Yeah, that's totally it. What are we doing?

Okay. Hi, Penelope. Who is Zero?

I think that's huge, isn't it? So like...

[Frogitha]
Is this session going to be in the Feywild? That's important information.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, you're going straight for the guy that's going to cause you those kinds of problems.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah. I remember... You joined halfway in, but Mimosa was trying to change the...

The paper that made them attack her kingdom. And on the way, she had a threat that was like, if you do this, the Huntsman's going to attack your fairy friends. And she went, all right, we'll just kill you first, and kept going.

So this is her killing him first. This is us killing him first before he kills... Because she promised...

I think it was Cerys. She was like, hey, so this happened and I went, whatever, but it's okay, we're going to kill him first. Like, I will fix it.

Cerys is delighted. Yeah, that's what this is. Just like, don't worry, I'll take care of it for you.

You got it.

[Speaker 8]
She does tell you horror stories about it. Yeah. Her life was completely derailed by this monster.

So this should be interesting.

[Frogitha]
Isn't there a weird thing that if there's another enemy attacking Ceryn, that the Huntsman has to go after the enemy before it goes after Ceryn?

[Referee (James)]
That is correct.

[Speaker 8]
So maybe I should bring Ceryn. Wait, does that work for Cerys too or just Ceryn?

[Referee (James)]
It also works for Cerys.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, cool.

[Referee (James)]
I thought you had a level 5 person, at the very least.

[Speaker 8]
Susudio is like, 30, 40 away from... Yeah, just a couple points away. But I definitely feel like one of the fairies should be here, for better or for worse.

[Referee (James)]
I think for worse. Nice, sweet girl.

[Speaker 8]
I think I could bring Susudio, and after one encounter, he'd be level 5.

[Frogitha]
What do we think? Should I bring Cerys?

[Landie (Nova)]
The one encounter we're doing today is fighting the Huntsman.

[Frogitha]
Is that it? We're not going to encounter anything else on the way there? Okay.

All right.

[Referee (James)]
There it is, I found it.

[Frogitha]
I'm underleveled anyway.

[Referee (James)]
I'm underleveled anyway. Yeah, so if you... The way it's going to work is...

Give me a second, let me figure out... Give me a second, please.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Query question, should I also bring my other level 6 along, not just Calum, for this?

[Speaker 8]
Or are we good?

[Referee (James)]
I think it's okay without them.

[Landie (Nova)]
Unless the magic items they have are, like, crazy fucked, like the Huntsman's magic items.

[Speaker 9]
Which is possible.

[Landie (Nova)]
The difficulty, James said, was level 9 plus magic items. So, like, from a Palpatine's perspective, punching all levels above your weight is, like, boss level. It's like a solo boss.

So, theoretically, we should be able to do this as level 6s, unless magic items are fucked strong.

[Frogitha]
Can I bring another character along?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh my god, do we need to bring the level 6 in?

[Landie (Nova)]
That's already for a party of four. We already have five people here, even though Kairos is lower level. I think it's okay.

Like, if we have to retreat, that's, like, our best worst outcome. Kairos may die.

[Frogitha]
If Kairos dies, can I bring...

[Speaker 8]
Someone get Daryl out. Who out?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I can't drag the goblin guy out.

[Speaker 8]
Oh. I have a rat pipe.

[Frogitha]
The rat pipe, it, um... That, like, summons a rat sometimes, right, James? Or something like that?

I think I remember you saying something about that.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, what does it say on it? Who am I trying to get out of here?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, Zero.

[Referee (James)]
Who the fuck is Zero?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Apparently it's huge, I don't know, get him out. Get him out.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's this guy, though. Excuse me, I'm dying over here. I'm just dying.

[Frogitha]
Yes, each time you increase your wounded or dying condition... Oh, okay, never mind.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
File for harassment, Maelstrom. File for harassment. Stew.

[Referee (James)]
Stew. Is that Maelstrom? Is he being noisy?

Oh my god, he's so noisy.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yes, he's being harassed. It's not beautiful.

[Referee (James)]
He sounds like a baby.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
He's being abused, clearly.

[Referee (James)]
He's a fat baby. You're gonna be babied.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You're gonna get scratched in the face. I don't think so. I think he whines more than anything.

I wish he would. Because he looks like he wants to. He wants to kill you so much right now.

So undignified.

[Referee (James)]
He's very undignified. It's even worse when I go...

[Referee (James)]
Isn't that like that?

[Referee (James)]
His eyes are getting progressively lowy.

[Frogitha]
He's powering up, you better put him down.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Thank you, Rosie. Thank you, thank you. Say goodbye, Maelstrom.

Bye, buddy.

[Referee (James)]
Go file a complaint with HR. Yeah. Looking good, Maelstrom.

He hasn't run away, he's just sitting there wagging his tail.

[Speaker 8]
I go home tomorrow, I'm so excited.

[Referee (James)]
Nice.

[Speaker 8]
Been gone for days. Been ages. I think I left on like...

Yeah, I left on the 9th, and I've been gone since then.

[Referee (James)]
Wow. I made yummy soup.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, James. Scooter wanted me to ask if you're available to run a game on Wednesday?

[Referee (James)]
Wednesday, probably.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
Like, um, around... I don't know what time zone you're in, but like... 9pm Eastern?

[Referee (James)]
9pm Eastern, yeah, so I'd be...

[Frogitha]
That'd be like 8.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, that'd be around the same time that we did last time.

[Frogitha]
Okay, cool. I'll make an event after this. Actually, I could just do it now.

[Referee (James)]
What we're gonna do tonight... Very simple, probably very short... Well, not very short, because I think the combat encounter itself...

There's a good chance it'll last a long time. Is... Any last minute down times.

Very briefly. Which will basically just count for the... Which will...

Really just count for the next encounter, which will be a skill challenge. So, the way... The way the skill challenge is gonna work is there will be...

Up to five rounds. Each round that goes on, I'm going to increase his... Frightened condition by one.

For each, like, successful... Successful round. That you guys participate in.

In other words, having a majority of skill checks that are... That are successful for the party. And that will, in effect, basically bring his level down.

[Referee (James)]
Each round that he is frightened.

[Referee (James)]
It's mostly gonna have to do with things like... Finding some kind of information on him. Either finding information on him...

That would be used to magically fuck with him. Like information about his name. About his title.

About the Huntsman themselves and their weaknesses. Setting up traps with Rangers and things like that. And actually...

Putting those... Bringing those plans to fruition. Your backup plan.

Your exit plan right now. Set up in advance. Is a bunch of the Rangers and Wardens have a...

They have a bunch of mounts around. They are prepared to assist you in a very, like... Abstract sense, but things like escape.

Because they've lost quite a few of their people. Banishing this guy. If you guys get into trouble, or if you just want to pull out...

They have a very large aquatic mount. That they can use to teleport.

[Frogitha]
Can I have a second... Can I have a second character on standby with them? Because, like, Cerys might die.

Alright, I'll have...

[Referee (James)]
I'm really surprised that you don't have anybody level 5. I really thought you had somebody level 5.

[Frogitha]
The studio is so close to being level 5. I might have him as my backup instead of Siren. I think he's going to stay far the fuck away from this. Kibi could also be on standby. I'll have Kibi on standby.

[Referee (James)]
Kibi is the one that I thought was level 5. She is second closest to being level 5.

[Referee (James)]
To begin... Let me just drag them out so that you guys can target them. Go ahead and drag your...

I haven't looked at voice chat yet. I'm going to regret it once I do. Drag your tokens out.

I'm going to give you this thing. So you can target him.

[Referee (James)]
With your various recall knowledges and such. Where is he? I love the name of this token.

[Referee (James)]
I was going to say... Those motherfuckers.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's hot, baby. It's hot. You gotta wait.

It's hot. I will get you your own, but you gotta wait. It's hot.

[Referee (James)]
Those are some bare ass boobies.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oops. If you zoom really close in...

[Heart (Kamon)]
She has boobies and nipples.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
This is an NSFW adventure.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Hold on. I'm trying to find the neuron activated.

[Referee (James)]
I'm trying to zoom in.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hang on, baby. It's hot. Let me put some...

Let me trip on you. Let me put some ice cubes in. You guys have the patience of nothing.

[Referee (James)]
So round 1 will be the one round that you guys can use for things like downtime actions or just regular skill checks versus this guy. This will make this less likely to kill somebody.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
Do we roll initiative or do you just want these now? This will be now. Okay.

I know we'll do a warfare lore. Is it to formulate strategies and things to fight this guy? Not bad.

I love the plus zero intelligence to a check.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
We have no lore skills.

[Frogitha]
I'll warfare lore.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Thank you, thank you.

[Frogitha]
What do I know about it? Just based on experience.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hell yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Based on experience. Do you have Siren or Karis right now? Karis.

Biggest thing that you know about him is just the traditional Huntsman lore that Huntsman have their hearts replaced with a title owned by the hag. You know that the heart is killed or struck kind of like a vampire, like staking a vampire. That's particularly effective.

You know that Huntsman can be challenged if successfully taunted to focus down on one person.

[Frogitha]
I was going to ask do we know how she escaped the Huntsman and then I remembered what...

[Referee (James)]
Specifically the specific manifestation of that was Siren was the one who taunted that Huntsman when you two were the last ones alive.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Nice.

[Referee (James)]
And went the other direction. Anything that would trick or demoralize him or whatever means he's going to focus you down for the next turn.

[Landie (Nova)]
Do we know if he has reactive strike? That is something I would like to know with my wall of finish. You know that he has reactive strike.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
If I stay far away from him I'll be fine because he can't hit me.

[Referee (James)]
That's two successes. Common, you're aware that he has the Warfare lore was also successful so I'm going to get to that in a moment. Common, you're aware that he has a blight effect and a frightful presence Actually, I'm going to give this for the Warfare lore.

He has a frightful presence. It's a BC 25 will save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to the monster's frightful presence for one minute.

So it's kind of like a... You come within 30 feet of him, you gotta roll and then that's probably going to be the only time you have to deal with it. That'll be the Warfare lore as you're kind of convening with the Wardens, Rangers and things like that.

Is that still going? It is. Common, you got to go through I'm going to have to plug in in a moment.

You know two things. One, you know that the unusual full plate that he was wearing that's shaped like a dragon is in fact made of dragon hide and it has a deathless rune on it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Meaning?

[Referee (James)]
He can't die? Not that he can't die, just that it's kind of like Death Ward from 5D. What?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
What?

[Landie (Nova)]
I just sent in chat, plate now shaped like titties.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Basically the deathless rune, I say that cheaters if I don't have it on as well but it's a reaction that if you gain the doomed or the wounded condition you can lower the triggering condition by one.

[Landie (Nova)]
How many times can you do that?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Once per day.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's only cheating when the enemies have it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Thank you, you're so right.

[Landie (Nova)]
I love 5E counterspell.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That doesn't sound like the most useful thing for an enemy to have though. Sure, unless it can come back, which I mean.

[Referee (James)]
Which they can, they typically come back about once per season if not sooner.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well it would have wounded in that case anyway.

[Referee (James)]
If they come back sooner, he will have wounded. So if he gets sent right back out there then he's easier to kill. They do not come back with their magic items though.

[Frogitha]
We will encounter him again in 2026. Probably sooner if we're unlucky because it is often.

[Referee (James)]
Also finally, the guy's title, which is kind of serving as his true name, that's one of the downsides of Huntsman because it's replaced with the title that kind of becomes their true name is The Lantern on the Night of Revolt.

[Frogitha]
The Night of Revolt, that sounds fun. I'm sure it was.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's actually very concerning, that's a title that was given to them. Who did that beforehand?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I wondered. I wondered. What did he say?

Paul Revere? For the Civil War or some bullshit, a lantern was lit to signify that it was the Oh no, it wasn't the Civil War, it was the one before that.

[Frogitha]
It was our Independence War.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yes, yes. I so paid attention.

[Landie (Nova)]
James is muted.

[Heart (Kamon)]
James, we can't hear you.

[Frogitha]
You've insulted his hyper fixation, I can tell.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I did, but it was for him. I didn't do any of that.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, so Nova and Cammon did a downtime. I don't know if Cerys is counted as a downtime.

[Frogitha]
To be fair, I still have a super downtime. I had chicken nuggets the whole time.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You're also muted, James. I don't know if you're still muted. But we did not hear your soapbox spiel.

[Landie (Nova)]
Still muted.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Paul Revere sucked. What a dumb point in history.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Does it go on? Three minutes.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh man.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Back to the wind tunnel. Wind tunnel back. Was that James' wind tunnel, or was that a fraud of a wind tunnel?

[Speaker 8]
It was James.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's a very distinctive wind tunnel. I don't know what downtime a mouse could take.

[Landie (Nova)]
Do you have society or diplomacy? You could rally some of the I have diplomacy. Maybe rally some of the troops or something to scare it a bit more.

Would be my suggestion.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Sure, I'll do that.

[Landie (Nova)]
Is there a specific I did have the lantern targeted, but it didn't give me a successful failure, so I don't think it matters if you If you're doing just like it.

[Referee (James)]
If you're doing like regular That's for like if you're doing recall knowledge or something like that against it. Something where it would use its DCs.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm gonna rally the troops and I don't know if there's a specific button or if I just do my diplomacy.

[Landie (Nova)]
Just do your diplomacy role.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okie dokie. Is that good enough or do I need to Not going to count as failure.

[Referee (James)]
You guys have won round one anyways at this point, which actually what I'll do is I'll just count that as Oh wait, no I won't because it's the downtime one. Yep. What you do is you get one of the older Rangers who mentions his father who he lost in the Cloud Forest.

He has a stash of anti-fe weapons that he really does not like loosing. It's a bunch of old iron arrows that are enchanted to split in flight and so they're better able to harry the huntsman as he gets yanked to think of it like a very elaborate gate spell that they've set up. Basically as this guy comes out that's when they're gonna pepper him with arrows.

In exchange you gotta find his dad.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah that's fine.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's just a forest. We kinda know where he is in the forest also.

[Landie (Nova)]
Navigating the forest is really hard.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It is. I couldn't help it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's my favorite place. I love how awful it is.

[Frogitha]
Didn't Scooter's character die there? Uh huh. He's not happy about that.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I also have no idea. I could do a backflip.

[Referee (James)]
No worries. If you don't have anything for downtime or anything like that I could just mark it like that. Here's one thing.

I'm pretty sure it was Nessie but I can't remember. Somebody has a manticore.

[Frogitha]
Uh that's Siren. How dare you mention manticore in the presence of Clank. Should I have brought Siren?

Should I just switch them out really quickly? Mimosa also has a manticore, no?

[Heart (Kamon)]
No?

[Referee (James)]
Why are you inventing a manticore for her?

[Frogitha]
Can Cerys borrow the manticore?

[Referee (James)]
What? What? Can I borrow it?

Can I borrow it?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That's not my cape. I don't have that cape.

[Referee (James)]
Siren does.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I've never heard about that before. I don't know what you're talking about.

[Referee (James)]
The cape happened during a session you were present for. I don't know what to tell you.

[Landie (Nova)]
It doesn't help when the cape's disappeared for three months.

[Referee (James)]
Well the manticore's been there. He's just been chilling.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I don't remember needing a manticore to get into my...

[Landie (Nova)]
Another level 10 item.

[Frogitha]
I'm talking about the one that ate Clank. Can I have Cerys borrow it?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Sure. I have this gross, tattered cape that one of Landy's people gave me.

[Landie (Nova)]
It's not that cape.

[Heart (Kamon)]
It's not that cape. Different cape. It's the weird, tattered one we found at the end.

The gross, tattered one. I'm so sorry.

[Referee (James)]
It can attack the manticore rather than killing you instantly.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay. Manticore equals fodder.

[Frogitha]
I can live with that. Literally. Hopefully.

[Landie (Nova)]
Strong as a manticore, it might just win. No, it's not strong enough. We're stronger than it now.

[Referee (James)]
Where's that manticore? Hey, anybody. What are you looking for?

[Frogitha]
Thank you.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Mercifical.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, is that it for round 1? I think so. So, round 1 is a success.

We'll increase his frighten condition by 1. And for round 2...

[Frogitha]
Should we be spread out? Does it matter where we are?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, right now I just have the guys out here so it's easier to track everything.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, do you want more? Oh, you do want more.

[Referee (James)]
For round 2, give me more skill checks. If you have them, if you have ideas for them, you guys will be approaching. At this point, probably set up on the island itself.

Very small island. Where they're setting up crystals, and setting up little fey twigs, and making their own kind of corrupted... The way the rangers would explain this to you is they are trying to make a broken fairy circle.

Something as close to a proper fairy circle as they can while still being artificial and still being broken. Kind of like how in America the Amish will build a barn and they'll leave one nail... This is all folktale.

Because only God is perfect, they'll leave one nail unhammered or unfinished in there. That's kind of the vibe that they're going for right now. Specifically because they believe it will harm him unless he comes through.

Like, this portal's fucked up. What's up? No, he's going to get pulled through it.

You should not go through it. Because that would cause problems.

[Frogitha]
If I go through it, my character's dead. I'm giving you soup. Why so?

Why so?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Huh? Why so if you go into this fairy circle would you just be poofed?

[Frogitha]
I just imagine that if I'm going through it, it's because he's dragging me through. Ah, valid. Fair point.

Which could lead to very cool plot points, but we're going to try to avoid it. Come back as evil, Cerys.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, I really have no idea what Para could do. Prepping is not her expertise.

[Frogitha]
Um... I could, like... Can I do spells?

[Referee (James)]
Sure. If you want to contribute something, like if you want to make something up in terms of... Again, it's a skill challenge.

I would like to...

[Landie (Nova)]
I would like to roll Intimidation to give a frightful aura to the magics that are occurring here to help debuff the guy. I like it.

[Referee (James)]
Gross.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Can I make this portal?

[Referee (James)]
What would that have been if you rolled it versus set his numbers in addition? Sorry, what? Did you not do it as Demoralize?

[Landie (Nova)]
I shouldn't have to. Oh, there we go. Critical failure.

[Frogitha]
And it was better.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Hold on, hold on.

[Frogitha]
Oh, there it is. For fuck's sake, why can't I do this?

[Referee (James)]
You spit on the... You go to spit on one of the fake mushrooms and you miss and a real mushroom pops up.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Cerys, you are using the feet. You want to make sure you drag that spell item the box that has the little sparkles and stuff you want to drag that into your focus spells.

[Frogitha]
Focus spells, thank you. Okay, see, I didn't know where to put it and it was like being an asshole about it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, your composition cantrips are your focus spells so that's where you want to put them. If it helps you, you can rename your focus spells to composition cantrips so that you know that if you are learning a composition cantrip that's where it goes.

[Frogitha]
And then I can drag that one over. Focus.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Alright. What would I roll to help them build their circle?

[Referee (James)]
Could be Arcana. Arcana is a really easy one. Performance, anything that has to do with art or artistry.

If you have any special tools or lores related to art or artistry relating to the faith, that's also appropriate.

[Landie (Nova)]
That's a lot of art and history and religion.

[Referee (James)]
Yes. Yes.

[Frogitha]
As a fairy myself, is there anything that I should do?

[Referee (James)]
You can, because you came here with prior knowledge of this guy if you want to give somebody else an advantage on their roll I think it would be appropriate once per round.

[Frogitha]
Okay, cool. Who hasn't gone yet?

[Referee (James)]
Everybody except for Nova.

[Frogitha]
Okay, Nova, you get advantage. Ugh. Dog.

Dog. Dog. Dog.

Alright.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, so I can roll religion to help them make it?

[Referee (James)]
Yes. Let me add his frightened condition because that's not actually a critical failure. His frightened condition is going to make this easier for you guys as time goes on.

Oh, dog.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yo!

[Speaker 9]
Nice.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Can he be intimidated or was there something that didn't let him do it?

[Referee (James)]
He can be intimidated, it's just like he has a large he has a high DC.

[Referee (James)]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
But as you guys succeed, he's going to get up to like at max frightened 5 which is going to make this significantly easier for you guys.

[Landie (Nova)]
Will that be going down each round like normal?

[Referee (James)]
I haven't decided yet. What do you think about this?

[Frogitha]
As a level 4, do you think I'm going to be able to actually get hit on any of my spells?

[Referee (James)]
Probably not. Well, your spells you can give your allies plus ones and the manticore plus one. The manticore can hit people.

Right.

[Frogitha]
Things like, you know, that and stuff like that. Then I also have soothe so I can use soothe on anybody if I'm not going to be able to do any of my mental ones like the spells like effects then I can just reserve all of my spells for soothe. I mean you have para here and that's literally all I do so.

That's true.

[Referee (James)]
Continuously soothing each other. Do you have other buff spells? One failure, one success.

Para, you draw a twilight flier to make a bunch of little dragon heads out of the mushrooms just like drawing faces on them and a little bit of carve out, say I have like clay here basically have your, like play-dohing these fake mushrooms making angry draconic faces at the center of the circle. It's a message of score. So everybody's gone except for Heart and Nessie.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I guess I'll try to intimidate or demoralize. Okay. You could also set some traps.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I thought about that.

[Landie (Nova)]
Thievery would be great.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
What?

[Landie (Nova)]
You just do a thievery for all that would represent all of the prep needed.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, fuck. No, no, it's thievery. I said traps.

[Speaker 9]
Oh my god.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Does that do anything? Okay, thank you. I do.

[Landie (Nova)]
Are you sure you want to use a hero point now? Well, I mean...

[Referee (James)]
You guys are going to get another one at the start of combat.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I also hardly ever use hero points because everything is always different and it confuses me so I never use it.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know. That's good. I'll mark that as a success.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Would Judge of Doom help here or should I just demoralize since it's already Frightened 1?

[Referee (James)]
Judge of Doom is only one round though. It's only one round in combat but for a skill challenge I can extrapolate from Actually, you guys are taking it further. I think.

I get what you're saying.

[Landie (Nova)]
You would be doing something similar in the context of the skill challenge rather than doing the word-for-word spell.

[Referee (James)]
If you're spending a spell for it then I don't have to necessarily use his. If you're spending a big resource for it I don't necessarily have to use his DC for it. This is more closer to be the group effort.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I'll use demoralize since technically that doesn't take out of my focus pool.

[Referee (James)]
If you do that then it would fail.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah, clearly.

[Referee (James)]
Round 2 is a tie then. We have two successes and two fails. You guys can vote.

Tell me when to stop or when to go at any point for the combat encounter.

[Landie (Nova)]
I kind of just want to send it. Anyone?

[Frogitha]
One more. Can performance do anything? Sure.

[Referee (James)]
Performance, what are you doing for performance?

[Frogitha]
Can I just hype everyone up with a performance?

[Referee (James)]
I think so.

[Frogitha]
Alright, cool.

[Referee (James)]
Unless your spells are based on it. Any of the others.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, is this a new round?

[Referee (James)]
Yep, round 3.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okie dokie.

[Referee (James)]
What to do, what to do.

[Speaker 9]
What is a good action?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well, let's distract. Let's hope that works.

[Referee (James)]
Hera got over Hera got over 30 for round 2 so that would be a critical success.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, so would it still have been a tie or would it not have been a tie?

[Referee (James)]
It would not have been a tie. I'm going to increase his sprite value after I get these No! I pressed the wrong button!

Are you doing Are you doing this with the group or are you trying to do this on the guy?

[Heart (Kamon)]
With the... Excuse me? What do you mean by with the group versus with the guy?

[Referee (James)]
If you tell me what you're trying to do is with the people around you and the rangers, trying to set up a trap for this guy.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yes, it would be a distraction It was supposed to be a distraction of sorts so that it would be easier to capture the guy but it seems it did not work as a good distraction.

[Referee (James)]
If you'd like to spend a spell on that I would let you turn it into a success.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay. Spend a spell on it.

[Referee (James)]
Like a glyph of warning where it's a message of fuck you.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah, alright. I'll spend a spell on it. I've reduced Danzo.

I've just lowered the amount of spells I have to use.

[Referee (James)]
There's always more recall knowledge and things like that that you can do against these guys as well.

[Landie (Nova)]
Can I try an athletics to make our trap optimal? Maybe move some big rocks or something, I don't know. Yeah.

Give us better cover for hiding and stuff.

[Referee (James)]
I mean you're coming here and you have people with boats and canoes here. Oh my goodness, I'm rolling so badly. That's a success though.

Oh, you are rolling like shit though. Yes, I am.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm looking at my 15 and my 16.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, round 3 is a success. I'm going to mark him as...

[Landie (Nova)]
I was really scraping the ball with athletics for that one. Can we please fight this thing?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I was gonna... If that was a success, that's fine. Can I put this down before we summon him?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. It'll just count towards round 4.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
And then we can just fight since no one else wants to do anything.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, hey!

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, I still have it from the last time.

[Heart (Kamon)]
You kept it! Yay! And then I probably never used it.

It's a one-time use. It works fantastically here.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Unfortunately, I think we are going to have problems with a lot of our fae, but yes, I will just put it right on top of that portal thingy.

[Speaker 9]
I like it.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, last call.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'll use Oni Lore to channel the historic nature of Onis into bullying this creature. Ugh.

[Speaker 9]
20 again?! No!

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Is that your magical number for the night?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, my corks. You're conversing with the other guys around you. They're going over different legends of the title ever since Comlin revealed it to them.

They're going back and forth on what they could do. You know that spirits really fucking hate broken mirrors as a rule? The lantern on the Night of Revolt, you have this dumb idea that if you stick a broken mirror inside a lantern and point it at him, point it at the circle where he's going to pop up, that it's going to be a real middle finger.

You don't know why!

[Landie (Nova)]
Nova also tells them that she's afraid of beans, because she is an Oni.

[Referee (James)]
I don't get that reference.

[Landie (Nova)]
It's just a feature that Caldera Oni have in Pathfinder. If you throw beans at them, they get frightened too.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
There's a tradition in Japan where at the new year you throw soybeans around to scare off any Oni. I think it's Yo-Kai in general, but why beans? What's scary about soybeans?

[Landie (Nova)]
When Oni are scared that way in the game, they have a weakness to spirit damage increase.

[Frogitha]
I wouldn't be too happy if someone started throwing beans at me, so I get it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I would just eat them. Roasted soybeans are delicious.

[Landie (Nova)]
Nova's terrified of them. There's a big banquet or something after any of the things we've done. She's visibly shaking at the thing of bowl of beans.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Like a little Chihuahua.

[Referee (James)]
One more and he goes to frighten four.

[Frogitha]
Can I do something else?

[Referee (James)]
You can do anything or a new round.

[Frogitha]
Oh, okay. I don't know what I can do.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I'm this close to also pulling a land in and being like, Kitsune Lore, surely there's something in here.

[Landie (Nova)]
They're the tricksters. They should have something. Do it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well, if this fails, I'm going to be so sad.

[Referee (James)]
That would be a failure. Paris could give you advantage on that.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's a good idea. Okay. Twenty.

Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Anything that you're thinking for Kitsune? Yeah.

I'm going to take the opportunity to read up on them.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I guess I'll roll a stealth or something. I don't know. I'll hide.

[Referee (James)]
Hide through initiative? For twenty, I've just gone through the Kitsune Lore. You pin a big foxtail to one of the mushrooms.

[Speaker 9]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
Because this will frighten the Nooglebee on its entry.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
So my hiding is going to be part of initiative?

[Referee (James)]
Sure. If you would like to hide, I'm going to roll stealth for initiative. Either way, round four at this point is a success.

Shall we fight it then?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yes. We should because it's almost nine.

[Referee (James)]
Place yourselves wherever you'd like.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Is it coming in through right here?

[Referee (James)]
He's going to come in through this circle.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, cool.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'm just going to move back a little bit, get the Manticore and Nova between the front line and the back line and have Mimosa try and Yeah, I like that.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Either here or over here so that we're already kind of flanking.

[Referee (James)]
If you want to draw up to six 10x5s of cover, you can do so. Earlier check letting you drag up canoes and boats and stuff like that that you guys can use to hide behind and such. Block line of sight.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Is this water that we're in?

[Referee (James)]
It's not. You're not swimming in it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, you said how big of a cover could we have? 5x10s 5x10s Or 10x5s Now is that squares or is that distance?

[Referee (James)]
Distance like two square, two down and one across I'm assuming I'm under a bush.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That's where I'm going to hide.

[Speaker 9]
Why does it look like that?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Because I did a spell. And then I have to change the color because this is also pink. I just like the 9.7 feet by 2.6 What's a good color that's not in this map? There's nothing. Gray I tried the black but it doesn't show up very well.

[Referee (James)]
Well, don't just use the drawing tool with the fill thing. Measurement control is not going to do it.

[Frogitha]
Do we have to move around the bells?

[Referee (James)]
No, that's just for covering that Noah was able to drag on land. Then add yourselves to initiative.

[Speaker 9]
What the fuck?

[Heart (Kamon)]
What happened?

[Landie (Nova)]
I rolled a 2 again.

[Referee (James)]
Go ahead and everybody add one hero point on top of your hero point for beginning the session. Thanks.

[Landie (Nova)]
I shift my eminence to fire his edge as part of initiative.

[Frogitha]
I'm walking my own execution right now.

[Referee (James)]
Where is Karis?

[Frogitha]
Nowhere. She's hiding.

[Landie (Nova)]
Am I allowed to move Noah for a little bit? I'd like her to start here if that's fine.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Do you want me to start over here?

[Landie (Nova)]
Maybe over here so you can sneak up. I don't want it going for you if it manages to spot you first. Maybe just so Noah is closer to it than you.

I think that's good.

[Referee (James)]
No, Karis, it's time to begin. That's going to kill me.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It is. You'll die gloriously.

[Landie (Nova)]
Sorry, I should have mentioned this before. I have an hour-long transformation. Can I have that active before the fight starts?

[Referee (James)]
Any kind of potions you want to take beforehand?

[Landie (Nova)]
Sorry, Nova's not here, but someone else can help you with this fight.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I forgot. I feel like Mimosa knows. She just pretends she doesn't.

[Landie (Nova)]
You have to roll the seek to discern that.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm just thinking she's worked with Mimosa.

[Landie (Nova)]
He doesn't do this very often, so she might not, but you can roll the seek. You can try and discern it. The DC is 28, I think.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, is it? Are you saying that?

[Landie (Nova)]
It is. I can ping the ability. This guy doesn't know that I'm Nova, though.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That sucks that that's kind of my nat 20 for the night.

[Landie (Nova)]
Incredibly funny. You just go along with all of Nova's crap anyway. Yes, yes, of course.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh my gosh, where did Nova go? I think it's funnier if Para doesn't know. I cast Equius Orb.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh.

[Landie (Nova)]
Crit fail.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, Nova, no.

[Referee (James)]
You're engulfed in the orb. That's it, you're engulfed. You're just in the orb.

Just in the stupid fucking temple of everything. Does that do anything? I begin suffocating.

Well, if you're not holding your breath, you start suffocating, but also because you critically failed, you can't swim to get free.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I think you can still escape, though, which is the same roll.

[Landie (Nova)]
Escape is like an unarmed strike, I think.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Isn't it? Can't you also use athletics?

[Heart (Kamon)]
I suppose they made the difference because you can now attempt an acrobatics or an athletics check instead of your attack modifier.

[Referee (James)]
It's the difference. That's the only difference, though.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, I guess the successful swimming check is different from, yeah, still.

[Referee (James)]
It uses movement to...

[Landie (Nova)]
When it casts a spell, it triggers a reactive strike.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Reactive strike?

[Referee (James)]
Leave the line, GM.

[Landie (Nova)]
It has a manipulate trait on the spell. I'll hit it. Hopefully.

Miss. Never mind.

[Referee (James)]
Stop rolling 2. Stop rolling the 2 to 4 range, please.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'll use a hero point on that one.

[Referee (James)]
Crit! It disrupts the spell.

[Speaker 9]
Easy.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hell yeah.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, nice.

[Landie (Nova)]
The spell doesn't get cast. It wastes 2 actions. Easy.

Let's go. Dab. Really?

Okay. Yeah, it's in the text of reactive strike there. Your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, which the spell was.

You disrupt that action.

[Referee (James)]
That's brutal.

[Heart (Kamon)]
So you're free from the orb.

[Landie (Nova)]
The orb never existed. That's a hero point for the ages, dear god.

[Speaker 9]
That is a hero point. That's a good start.

[Referee (James)]
It is its turn. Hera.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Would it still have moved there, even if Nova wasn't? Oh yeah. Alrighty.

Well, I'm going to... Well, we'll start off with the usual needle darts.

[Landie (Nova)]
Nice. Nice. We love a bit of metagaming.

[Referee (James)]
That's fair.

[Landie (Nova)]
Of course it's weak to metal. That's cold iron.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
And that will be me.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Come on. It's moved slightly out of my range of things, which is very rude of it. Let's see.

What can we do to make sure it will? You know. Needle darts.

Oh, a miss. Shocking. Cerys, do you need me to drag you?

No, I can't drag you. Too few things. We're going to try to shoot the thing.

Ah, a hit. Poor damage, but damage is damage. That is my turn for now.

[Referee (James)]
Turn ended. Cool. Mimosa.

Yeah, well. Currently off guard to you.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, they are.

[Landie (Nova)]
Off guard until my next turn for my crit. Oh, shit. You're right.

[Referee (James)]
That's a hit. That is a hit. That hurts.

Cerys.

[Frogitha]
All right. By the way, I do have three potions on me. When I die, you guys can have them.

Thank you. Very important. Am I in charge of the manticore?

[Referee (James)]
Yep. You could use a command action to get into action. Cool.

[Frogitha]
Move here. I'll use my second.

[Referee (James)]
Are you moving?

[Frogitha]
Oh, shit. Never mind. I'm not moving.

We're good. We're Gucci.

[Referee (James)]
We're gonna... What's the point of giving you guys a greater striking room if I can't use it?

[Frogitha]
We're going to try that again.

[Speaker 9]
I missed. Cool.

[Frogitha]
Fuck it.

[Referee (James)]
Did you want to use a spell to buff him before that happened?

[Landie (Nova)]
James is trying to bait you into using a manipulate action. Don't do it.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't say anything. It's not the tutorial zone, but that doesn't mean I can't give advice. It just means I'm not obligated to give good advice.

[Frogitha]
God damn it. I'm going to hero point that one.

[Landie (Nova)]
It would actually have multi-attack penalty 10 because you share it with your creature you're controlling.

[Frogitha]
Do I?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes.

[Frogitha]
If that's the case, I would not have done that. Um...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, your companion shares the multi-attack? Yes.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
There isn't a movement that you can do that lets you... I believe it's step, which doesn't trigger reactions, but that's assuming you can step.

[Referee (James)]
Manticore has no actions left to step. You can have the Manticore move. The Manticore is the one that moves, not the one that has to get targeted.

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes, the Manticore would trigger the attack.

[Frogitha]
I wish I knew this shit before I... Okay, you know what? I'll use my third action to have the Manticore...

[Landie (Nova)]
So you would have to spend all three actions commanding the Manticore, and it would be able to take a third action, I believe is how that works. So that is fine. Manticore could step, or you could have it stride away and get hit.

[Frogitha]
Okay. What is its movement? Fly 40?

[Referee (James)]
Fly 40?

[Frogitha]
What if we fly up 40 feet?

[Landie (Nova)]
Flying up directly is difficult terrain.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, we fly up 20 feet? Yes.

[Frogitha]
Okay, I will do that. And then I will do 20 feet. Oh, shit.

Cerys is hiding behind him.

[Landie (Nova)]
If he's 10 foot... If he's large, you would leave its range at... 15 feet in the air?

No, at the 20 foot point. You would leave its range.

[Frogitha]
Better it than me. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Now that's... That's just two actions for Cerys. Cerys has one action left.

[Landie (Nova)]
No, Cerys would spend three actions commanding the animal, so it can take three actions. Because it attacked twice and moved.

[Referee (James)]
But that would just be through it. So your first command gives it two actions though, right?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes, you can command it with one action to give it two, or three actions to give it three.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, so you can't do two actions.

[Landie (Nova)]
No. This feeds to make it more efficient, I think. Do I have to spend an action goading it?

Because I don't want it to turn and kill Mimosa.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I've got nibbled on.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Mimosa can still run if she needs to, because the reaction is done, maybe?

[Landie (Nova)]
Its turn is between now and then though.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I've got nibbled on.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Just, you know, maybe it'll be fine.

[Landie (Nova)]
Action one, stride. Action two, strike.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah! Pressure.

[Landie (Nova)]
I can't really gain anything by demoralizing it, but I want to goad it. I guess I'll just attack it again, though. That'd get my attention.

Hot dog, that was the correct decision. Um, hold up. Is it still off guard?

It shouldn't be. Because it's the start of my turn. Does a 25 hit it currently, if it's not off guard?

Does a 25 hit it? You rolled a nat 20, it doesn't matter. My first attack, though, for 15 damage.

It wouldn't hit if its AC is slightly higher.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

[Landie (Nova)]
Oh! Oh, that's really nice!

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Isn't it amazing?

[Landie (Nova)]
Okay, here's my crit damage, and it's off guard until the start of my next turn again. Let's go, gamers.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I love that you were talking about trying to flank it, and you had that the whole time.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I know, because here's what I forgot, and then I remembered it, and I forgot, and I remembered it.

[Landie (Nova)]
Alright, Nova's trying to get this thing to attack her with these strikes, too. I don't know if there's no mechanical way for me to do that other than praying that it targets me and not the most of it. That's the end of my turn, let's see if it works.

[Referee (James)]
Well, you could... I was about to say, you could roll above a 15 naturally to intimidate it, but that is mechanically impossible. Your digital dice try to go up to 5.

Look, my attack rolls are good.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'll just keep rolling attacks, and it'll work out. Oh, goodness. I have credit twice.

Will it kill me? Just one shot, that would be pretty funny, honestly.

[Referee (James)]
Do cones count as further for large creatures?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes, it originates from the edge of its square. So you could do a cone like that, or like this.

[Referee (James)]
Anyway, I'll delete my suggestive cone. Alright, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to force you guys to make this save, because technically it's already happened.

[Landie (Nova)]
Oh, I forgot about Frightened, sorry.

[Referee (James)]
That's my bad.

[Landie (Nova)]
That happened to me when I was running a trick with it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
What's the distance on it? Is it the whole map, basically?

[Referee (James)]
Nope, it's just...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's only targeted.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, just give me a moment. Sorry. It set Cerys' 20 feet up.

Well, for us it's not the target. There you go. I'm going to roll for the Manticore.

Manticore's good! Mimosa!

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hang on, I'm tucking my sun in.

[Landie (Nova)]
Would my Frightened 2 have made me miss my fast attack?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, you know what?

[Landie (Nova)]
It becomes a 23 to hit.

[Referee (James)]
That would miss. Wait. No, it would not miss.

Get that fucking damage back on there. Because remember, with the flanking, it brings the AC down to 22.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
What is this for?

[Referee (James)]
For Frightened 2, it's okay. You are only Frightened 1 on a success.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I didn't succeed.

[Referee (James)]
Oh. There you go. Okay.

I have to beat this.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm Frightened 2? Is that what you said?

[Referee (James)]
Yes.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm only Frightened 1 right now.

[Landie (Nova)]
If you just left-click it, it goes up. There you go.

[Frogitha]
Frightened 2? Didn't I pass it?

[Referee (James)]
Oh my god. Wait. Confused.

[Landie (Nova)]
You're fine!

[Referee (James)]
No, no, guys, stop. I'm going to roll some attacks. Please do.

Please kill us.

[Landie (Nova)]
Take my bad luck. Take it.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Alright, that's fine.

[Landie (Nova)]
It's got a bastard sword. I'd really like that if it's magic. It sure is.

It kicks me in the face after missing twice. Oh.

[Speaker 9]
That was frustrating.

[Landie (Nova)]
Nova's looking pretty good, confident, and cocky. It just gets depthed in the face.

[Referee (James)]
It's like a bleeding nose. Oh man.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Alright, Para is going to spend her entire turn charging up.

[Landie (Nova)]
Help me, help me, help.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
And I'll actually cast the spell on the next one. Because that's where all of the information is going to be. And we're going to have a lot between it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Alright. Hello! I have to move a bit closer.

Because this nerd decided to move out of my range. Is his frightened condition going down by any chance? Or has it been stable?

[Referee (James)]
It's going down? It's frightened condition is going down.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, I'll keep up Dirge of Doom then. So, gang. Let's just make sure that stays up.

Link in composition.

[Referee (James)]
That's close.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Actually, no, I don't need that right now because it's at 4. Since it's only a problem if it's 1. So we're going to do Courageous Anthem, gang.

So that we hit harder. And then we can do Lingering Composition. What do you mean I have no focus points?

Do not lie to me.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It probably spent your focus point. I have this problem in my other game where, for some reason, when using Lingering Composition, it spends 2 points every time. And I don't know why.

Well, that is most unfortunate.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, I always have to give myself back one.

[Landie (Nova)]
Holy moly. Come and pass a Lingering Composition check against this guy?

[Referee (James)]
Of all times to pass? Yeah, that's weird. I added a point back to your focus point.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Keep that support.

[Heart (Kamon)]
And now we attack the nerd. He's staying pretty still. Let's hope this works.

I'll just roll the damage to begin with. Please make a save. Incredibly rude of it.

But you still take 16 damage.

[Referee (James)]
I take half. Or do I?

[Heart (Kamon)]
No, it's the full damage.

[Landie (Nova)]
It's one sort of basic save.

[Heart (Kamon)]
For a moment I thought you were resistant to Mental. And that was what was happening. Okay, so that shall be my turn.

It would have been sick to get him sick.

[Referee (James)]
Also, I think this we'll see.

[Heart (Kamon)]
No!

[Landie (Nova)]
That was for Kamon, not for...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
The rest of us are immune except for Para, but Para should not come close.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Wait, shit. Kamon! Yes?

[Landie (Nova)]
I checked. It's okay. Is it fine?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, I see a line.

[Landie (Nova)]
Is it coming?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You're missing it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, I'm missing you by just barely.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Don't move, Kamon. I'm going to shoot something straight past your ear.

[Referee (James)]
Nova's gonna step to you. The Huntsman looks directly at Kamon and just...

[Heart (Kamon)]
What was that will save?

[Landie (Nova)]
Your frightened one from its aura.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, I am?

[Speaker 9]
To be frightened one.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well, damn. Oh?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Where? Me?

[Speaker 9]
Uh...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm going to put one of my daggers away as my last action.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I have a plan for next round, if it's still there.

[Referee (James)]
There it is!

[Frogitha]
Um... Who goes after me?

[Referee (James)]
I do. Nova.

[Frogitha]
Oh, Nova. I want to use... This?

I think this is a good thing to use. Is that a skill thing? A performance?

Is that helpful here?

[Referee (James)]
Not having to do a skill check. If you roll failure, you get it.

[Frogitha]
I don't think that covers saves.

[Referee (James)]
Nevermind.

[Landie (Nova)]
I would need to try and trip it for that to be used.

[Frogitha]
Oh, you know what? Ignore that because I'm going to cast Courageous Anthem. I already have it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Kamon's hopped it up. Yeah, no. They replace rather than stack.

[Referee (James)]
Which means if you have something you want to do, you're going to be more effective at it right now.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
So, you do have other anthems, don't you? Or is it just... Is that the only one?

[Frogitha]
In the feeling... How many allies am I going to kill with this?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you could do Counter Performance. That'd be funny.

[Landie (Nova)]
Top your body, charging in a Radiant Star.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's everybody I kill? No, that's because you're in the air. You can point it downwards.

[Landie (Nova)]
You can hit without hitting us. Para's doing that as well, is what I was referring to.

[Referee (James)]
This is going to be like in Magicka 2 where you cross the beams.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Just remember, if there's a third one, it's going to be bad.

[Landie (Nova)]
I don't know if I can do her line attack next turn.

[Frogitha]
I don't know how to make it diagonal. I'm going to place it here because I think I can adjust myself on the...

[Landie (Nova)]
I can see a line that hits just it. I don't think you need to stress about it.

[Referee (James)]
We don't have to fix the fidget. Just target him.

[Frogitha]
Use control. Oh, use control. Yeah, control.

Dammit. Alright, you know what?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Just hover over the spark and then use control and use your mouse wheel. And you should be able to turn it. That's such a bad roll.

[Landie (Nova)]
Put the sneak attack on it by firing the beam through the manticore.

[Referee (James)]
What is that? You spent three at... oh, okay.

[Frogitha]
I rolled terribly.

[Referee (James)]
44 force damage. Critical failure, but also blinded for one round. Listen, it was a good try.

[Frogitha]
I don't need to be... I don't need to hear it. Don't pander to me.

Okay, the combat tracker's not up, so... okay, there we go.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'll join in on the line attack goodness. I'll spend two actions not casting a spell. I'm not silly enough to do a manipulate action next to it.

That would be silly. I'm going to hit it instead. Hold up.

[Speaker 9]
What would it take?

[Landie (Nova)]
I'd have to release a weapon hand off... no, I'm just going to hit it. I'm going to hit it.

I'm going to hit it, then I'll let James hit me. That's a nice hit.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I just realized what I wanted to do was a manipulate, so...

[Landie (Nova)]
Just drop your weapon. That might be as well.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
No, I wanted to do dirty trick, which is a manipulate action.

[Landie (Nova)]
Oh, shit. Fuck it, we ball. I'll cast a spell.

I'll trigger its reactive strike.

[Referee (James)]
There we go. Oh, that's what I need to do next. Oh, well, you're already frightened, so it's fine.

It's me? Just trust. What's my fucking luck today?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah, if I wasn't frightened, I would have missed. Okay, now I get to... It didn't crit me, so my spell gets to happen still.

Shining Starlight Attack. It is the Swordswoman. It is a line.

It is piercing. It is a reflex save, so I can click this one, target it, and roll the damage. That should prompt a save for it.

Fuck, nice! It flips out of... I don't know, I miss.

She gets hit in the gut and sends the beam off in a slightly wrong direction. And that's my turn. Now it's going to kill me.

Oh, my frightened condition goes down one.

[Referee (James)]
That it does.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, should mine have? Yep. Aha!

[Landie (Nova)]
So should have the Manticore and Kairises. And... Kamons.

Kamons did go down. Excellent.

[Heart (Kamon)]
No, I only had one. I shouldn't have it at all, then.

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah, that's what I meant.

[Referee (James)]
I went to zero. Okay.

[Frogitha]
Big frightened off?

[Referee (James)]
Yep.

[Landie (Nova)]
Mimosa and Nova should both be frightened one still, and that's it.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Landie (Nova)]
Except for it, of course.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, it is going to go down. I've been slowly decreasing it. Makes sense.

This will not happen. It did have the Nightmare Rune. Because I didn't regenerate the attack.

Yes, I would like to replace it. What does that do? That makes more sense.

Yeah, motherfucker. Okay. Fine.

Fine. So be it. Nova!

[Landie (Nova)]
It's going to hurt. That one got me. It hurts a lot.

A lot. Oh, my god. I don't go down off that.

[Speaker 9]
Jesus.

[Landie (Nova)]
That's good. That's all I can ask for.

[Referee (James)]
Do I do Blight Breath, or... Or do I do the Dragon Breath? I'm going to do the Blight Breath.

I want to use Dragon Breath, but...

[Landie (Nova)]
I'm going to obliterate the manticore and the fairy in the sky with it.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, no, he is!

[Referee (James)]
He read my mind. Oh, no.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, no.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Do you have a zero? Okay. That's a failure?

What the fuck?

[Referee (James)]
That's a really good time to use it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's a level 9 creature.

[Referee (James)]
It's his thing. Otherwise, this was going to be double.

[Frogitha]
Holy fuck. Oh, my god.

[Referee (James)]
The garrison merely takes full damage. The manticore takes half. The manticore is doing pretty good work there.

That's his turn.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Jesus Christ. Okay, I get to finish this.

[Referee (James)]
I feel like such a fucking idiot. I never regenerated the attack after adding the runes.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, my good god.

[Referee (James)]
Oh. I didn't miss out on much damage because he didn't roll that many attacks. And also, he wasted one turn on a stupid spell.

[Landie (Nova)]
That's a lot of fours. Nice! Alright.

[Referee (James)]
How do you want to do this?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Doesn't he have to roll the thing?

[Referee (James)]
James is done with it. It's not going to roll here. Unless I rolled a crit, it was not going to make a difference.

Here. And half. Oh, wait, no!

I would have had five. Okay. Anything else?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, that's my whole turn.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
No, that's my whole turn. One good needle darts and you'll probably kill it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's true, that's true.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Especially because it's cold iron.

[Heart (Kamon)]
True. Do you have cold iron?

[Referee (James)]
I think everybody had better have cold iron something.

[Heart (Kamon)]
For needle darts, yes. Okay, cool, yeah, yeah.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You want me to hit? All you have to do is hit.

[Referee (James)]
I think if anybody hits with the cold iron, you can have a cold iron needle. With a cold iron toothpick.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Sure, why not? If this misses, I am... anyway.

Ah, it's a hit! Nice.

[Referee (James)]
How do you want to do this? Yay!

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, after it gets completely incinerated by a para, I see that it's still standing and I'm just like, ah! And I just target the shins of it. Whatever shins it has.

And it just sort of like, you know, does the thing on the ground.

[Referee (James)]
Beautiful, beautiful.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I love that you went through the shins.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, hold on. I have to... We need to check something first.

I'm afraid. Okay.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's fine.

[Landie (Nova)]
It hasn't used its reaction yet.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, wasn't a critical!

[Landie (Nova)]
Wasn't a critical. Oh, that's good! It just used its reaction on that, so it can't use its deathless rune.

[Referee (James)]
Cammon, my goat! Oh, wait! Does that mean...

do I have to use the deathless's... Hold on, do I have to use the deathless's reaction?

[Heart (Kamon)]
I think so.

[Referee (James)]
It is a rune. Okay. All right, so Cammon, take off that to do damage.

Damn. Unless I pull some bullshit like, oh, it's actually the egg using the fucking reaction. Ooh.

People love it when you do that.

[Landie (Nova)]
Mmm. Really earned bait and switch.

[Referee (James)]
That'd...

[Landie (Nova)]
Just all of us leave the server after this session.

[Referee (James)]
Very appropriate. All right. So he gets...

Hang on. Oh, maybe, maybe. All right, he's going to use the deathless rune.

He's going to come back with half health.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, hello.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
Paris, stop charging up again.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Is it still... It is still my turn. Okay, sick.

It is still your turn.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you for calling that out, by the way.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That's his reaction, right?

[Referee (James)]
I got you. That is his reaction. He does not get to whack people for free.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Cool. Okay. Well, I have exactly one action left, and I have nothing to do with it, so we're going to try shooting it.

A miss! Oh, well. That is the end of my turn.

[Referee (James)]
Mimosa. You're frightened. It increases...

No, it decreases. It decreases. Fuck you.

Bullshit. Jesus Christ. Nice.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
All right. Clumsy one.

[Referee (James)]
It's a horse-person combined. What do you do to... Do you take the donkey tail?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, I did think about that.

[Landie (Nova)]
Tie his tail to his back leg or something.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Something like that. Maybe diagonal legs get tied together.

[Referee (James)]
If you tie a rope around a horse's foot, they're going to have a problem.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, that's pretty much what she's going to do.

[Referee (James)]
They go from the intelligence of a four-year-old to a newborn giraffe.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah. Let's see, what's the rest of my...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You had something to have to give.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I had... You know what? I'm fine.

It looks dumb now.

[Referee (James)]
It does look dumb. It's back leg just keeps raising up and falling. It's really fucking distracting.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
One day, I will make a character that is specifically designed to be the absolute best at casting Clownish Curse, and I will just ruin Jinx forever.

[Referee (James)]
I'll be the server.

[Frogitha]
Powering up. This is going to be two rounds. This is going to take two rounds to fully power up, I think.

I think that's what it means. So, I'll just end my turn and then scroll back up later.

[Landie (Nova)]
Oh my god, I'm so hot.

[Frogitha]
If you right-click it, you can pop out message, and then you can just hold it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
That way, you don't have to scroll back up. Thank you.

[Landie (Nova)]
Action, strike.

[Referee (James)]
No, Chris. Damage.

[Landie (Nova)]
Second action, I will heal half of that. I will heal for nine damage. Me to 11.

[Referee (James)]
Regenerate the other attack too, just in case.

[Landie (Nova)]
Moving my icon to Scar of the Survival, and with my last action, I will hit it again. Secret miss. My turn has ended.

My frighten goes down. We are no longer scared.

[Referee (James)]
My frighten goes down, but my clumsy sure does not.

[Speaker 9]
Hehehehe.

[Referee (James)]
I wanted to get all of you in... Oh. Mr. Why did you do it?

I hope that's 20 feet. Yeah, I think this is like... I'm pretty sure it's like mathematically impossible to get all of you in that cone.

Unfortunate.

[Heart (Kamon)]
We spread out good. Three cheers, Gammon.

[Speaker 9]
Ah.

[Referee (James)]
Is that for Gammon? You are after me. Okay.

Technically, everyone's after you. Alright, that's not damaged. Don't worry about it.

So I get my blight breath back. Next round. Burn Nova and...

Yeah, we'll make it on Nova and Gammon. And your stupid orb too. No, it's an orb.

That's why. Hehehehe.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Hehehehe. And your stupid orb too.

[Referee (James)]
I would have gotten away with it. Jesus. Crit bail at 21.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh boy.

[Frogitha]
Holy shit.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Jesus. Oh my god. Okay.

[Frogitha]
That's the orb pass.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Well, you need an orb at 31.

[Referee (James)]
That's supposed to be 86. I'm sorry. Give me a second.

[Speaker 9]
That's okay. No!

[Referee (James)]
I almost... Alright.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, okay. My orb just survives. Very rude of what you did to it, though.

It's at 1 HP. Oh, Jesus Christ. Nova.

[Referee (James)]
Nova's very un... Nova's going to be uncontraceptive. Yeah, I'm not too...

[Landie (Nova)]
Like, it is what it is.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, don't worry. She got it. What do you think this big cone is?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Thank you, Para. Beloved.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, I just zoomed out and I saw that. That's crazy.

[Referee (James)]
We're going to yank out Flora's Femur.

[Frogitha]
Oh, no. Femur! No, chief.

No, thanks. How dare you.

[Referee (James)]
Hey, the attack roll and the damage were the same.

[Frogitha]
Holy shit.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Nice.

[Referee (James)]
That's pretty cool.

[Heart (Kamon)]
You okay?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It is very cool. Okay, Landy, I have a question. Would Cerys be getting hit by my 60-foot cone?

[Landie (Nova)]
Probably.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Because she's 20 feet in the air? Okay. I would assume so.

Okay, so I'm going to use a three-action heal. I have Directed Channel so I can make a six-foot cone. And I also have Selective Energy so that guy can get fucked.

[Landie (Nova)]
Huge.

[Referee (James)]
My healing goat. Directed Channel. Ooh.

Oh, that's so fucking cool. You're like...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, do I have to... He's not targeted.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, okay.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
No, he's not targeted. That's going to be... Because it's not undead, so I don't think it would matter.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Is that for everybody?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yep. Everybody in my cone, except for him. Yay.

[Referee (James)]
I'm pretty sure he's not undead.

[Frogitha]
Sir.

[Referee (James)]
No, he's amphibious.

[Frogitha]
Un... Heal.

[Referee (James)]
There we go.

[Frogitha]
Oh, the manticore! Oh, thank you, thank you.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Huzzah.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Arr, beloved.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
All right, that's me.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okie dokie.

[Referee (James)]
Batman.

[Heart (Kamon)]
It's me! One round remaining of Courageous Anthem, so you know what that means. I can also do a beam spell.

Would probably be... Beam, beam. Let's try to stun this guy.

Well, you get the drift. I don't need to put down the... The thing.

[Referee (James)]
It was starting to drown.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ahaha, that's fine.

[Referee (James)]
And I am totally gonna go cool. Which one has reach?

[Heart (Kamon)]
What do you mean, which one has reach?

[Referee (James)]
Just... Don't worry about it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay. Please roll your fortitude saving throw to see how well you succeed.

[Referee (James)]
But first...

[Heart (Kamon)]
H Christ, dude. Oh, so your spell doesn't do... Hm.

Exceedingly rude. Hold on, let me take that.

[Referee (James)]
Please go unconscious.

[Heart (Kamon)]
No, not yet. I'm good.

[Referee (James)]
Do not resist.

[Heart (Kamon)]
And one second. Exceedingly rude of you to do. Okay, so I'm slightly...

Wrong thing, not the orb.

[Referee (James)]
Bad orb. Give that to me. Trying to get something out of your dog's mouth.

Now, do you have to give the familiar actions to do that?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Nope, it's a free action.

[Referee (James)]
That's why it's an empty hole.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, it says two actions with the concentrate trait. I do think you do have to spend an action. That's weird, why does it have the free action thing then?

[Referee (James)]
Is it a free action or is that the command action?

[Landie (Nova)]
It's a free action from Kamon. It's a free action from Kamon, and the orb gets to do that.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, okay. I'm getting my thing back. One sec.

[Landie (Nova)]
I believe that's true. I believe it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Alright, that's the end of my turn.

[Landie (Nova)]
It's a once per day ability, which is...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, no, it's a familiar.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Do I revert that?

[Referee (James)]
I will let... Landi, you can look it up. It'll be easy to revert.

An attempted trait from me.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
And I'm going to assume that's my turn because I had to put my weapon back.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Alright. So...

[Frogitha]
Um... I think...

[Referee (James)]
It did use its reaction. Oh, shit.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, she's got to finish that one.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. I see, but I take... Additional damage.

[Frogitha]
Alright, well that's my go.

[Referee (James)]
Very cool. Is it three actions on both turns for those blind spots?

[Frogitha]
Yes. Yes.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Brings us to Nova.

[Landie (Nova)]
Um, so I actually can't find anything about it not being... About the orb being a free action, so I think I was wrong. I think it...

It's an action it can take when you command it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, that's fine.

[Landie (Nova)]
Nova's turn. She is on the ground, not holding her sword.

[Referee (James)]
Uh... I don't have my reaction back, so I can't hit you for standing.

[Landie (Nova)]
Or picking up my sword, excellent. I will stand with my first action. I never get the chance to do this because I'm always holding my two-handed sword.

I could try... No, I want to hit it. Oh!

I could heal, actually. I'm just going to heal.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Eh.

[Landie (Nova)]
I will move my icon back to my sword. It is not healing for 12. I am healing for 12.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
In my last action, I'll pick up my sword. Now with two hands.

[Frogitha]
Very reasonable.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh my god. I could have used a reaction. Dang nabbit.

Sorry.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I hate forgetting reactions.

[Landie (Nova)]
I love seeing at the end of my combat that my creature had reactive strike the whole time and I didn't use it once. Oh hey, I have my bad breath back.

[Speaker 9]
Yay.

[Landie (Nova)]
You're doing a stride action, is it? Reactive strike. I picked my sword up.

I made the correct decision.

[Referee (James)]
I don't think I could position myself correctly with a... Oh! We're cooking tonight.

[Landie (Nova)]
And a hero point. Miss. Damn.

[Speaker 9]
Sorry, gang.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know if we can actually hit you with that. Nah, it's 30 HP.

[Landie (Nova)]
I get you. Very funny. I assume that's meant to hit Mimosa, but that cone currently doesn't.

What? You need to...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah.

[Landie (Nova)]
Now I see a cone that hits three of us. You could probably hit the flying creatures with that cone as well. Well, it's only 30 feet, so it's...

I think it's too far. You're only 20 feet in the air.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Am I actually being hit?

[Referee (James)]
Technically you're not.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You know what?

[Referee (James)]
You're right. I couldn't get the placement.

[Landie (Nova)]
There is a better optimal cone placement that does hit Mimosa. Mimosa's targeted.

[Frogitha]
Whose side are you on?

[Landie (Nova)]
I know how hard it is to run a game.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I mean, here's the thing. I also do it to myself, so it's fine.

[Referee (James)]
It's his last hurrah. Alright, start making saves, people.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, which one do I do? Because there's two...

[Referee (James)]
Just look for the one that lets you click something. So down at the bottom, it'll have the Fortitude Save thing. And then I'll click the corresponding damage button.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh no, Mimosa! Oh god! Oh god!

Oh god! Oh, hang on!

[Referee (James)]
Roll the orb's fort save! I want to kill the orb!

[Landie (Nova)]
Who are pondering they orb?

[Referee (James)]
They'll never be pondered again. I'm rolling for the orb.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You don't like the wizard's orb?

[Referee (James)]
I despise the wizard's orb.

[Heart (Kamon)]
You're an ass, Mimosa.

[Referee (James)]
Mr. Grinch.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, so now you've knocked me out? Which I think is rude of you, but okay. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
The orb takes full damage. The manticore takes half, the carriage takes half.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah, the orb breaks until next week, basically. Which, again, very rude.

[Referee (James)]
It gets dying checks, doesn't it?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah, because it's a minion. Minions get dying checks.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
We figured this out during the camp session.

[Frogitha]
Oh, yay! Okay, well, my orb...

[Referee (James)]
Brings it to bear.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Um, well... I think I'm gonna do the same thing.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, I think you should do the same thing. I think we'd all love it if you did the same thing.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Alright, let me target everybody. Stupid manticore.

[Speaker 9]
Is the orb a construct? Alright.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Alrighty. You all get 24 healing.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Thank you, Pyro.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Thank you! What?

[Speaker 9]
Now kill it. Oh, it's my first turn.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
No, it's no longer...

[Speaker 9]
A third minion, so that sucks.

[Landie (Nova)]
Um... You could delay until after I act.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Can she do that since she's at the end of the turn?

[Landie (Nova)]
Um... Yes, because you're removed from initiative.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, okay, so...

[Landie (Nova)]
If you delay an entire round without returning to the initiative order, your actions are lost. And your initiative doesn't change. So, you can delay until the top of next round, yeah.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
But the top of next round is still before you...

[Landie (Nova)]
After me, sorry. You can delay until any point before your next turn.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, so... I will delay... Until after Nova goes.

So right before canon. Sandwiched in between them.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, I'm consistently bleeding? What the fuck?

[Landie (Nova)]
You're on fire.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You're on fire, but I don't think you would take that damage because...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I can't be on fire. You do take...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
No, I can't be on fire. I'm a water... Kineticist.

Does that automatically...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Non-magic... Is it a...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Is it a magical fire? It came from a sword, so I would think so.

[Referee (James)]
It came from a magic sword.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh.

[Landie (Nova)]
You do take persistent damage when you delay.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, you do? Weird.

[Landie (Nova)]
I don't think you'll take it at the end of your turn.

[Frogitha]
Oh, I'm... Curious. Alright.

I have... I have fairy bullets. Which I think fairy bullets...

Are always on fire. Oh. They don't do what I thought they do.

Um... Has he already used his reaction? Am I...

If I... If I do a... A spell with a manipulate...

He's not close enough to do that. Okay, cool.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You have to be within his range.

[Frogitha]
I doubt I will be able to... Okay. I doubt I will be able to, um...

Oh, you know what? Let's just have the fucking manticore come over here. Instead of doing a spell.

We're gonna...

[Landie (Nova)]
Rage doesn't have...

[Frogitha]
It's not letting me move!

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Because the manticore is not a minion, so... Um...

[Frogitha]
It's like... I want to play... Diagonally, so I can like actually get to it.

Okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
If the horseman has rage, the manticore would trigger...

[Referee (James)]
Random strike. It's... Is random strike for just, um...

[Landie (Nova)]
It's if you start a move action. If you leave a square within... Well...

These are all within the reach of the... Uh, person who has reactive strike. It's if you start a move action.

It's if you leave a square. It's if you do a manipulate action.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so that... That would be fine then, because he's starting... Further up.

Like, he's over... He's not actually 10 feet away. He's 20...

He's like 30 feet away. Yeah. So he's moving diagonally.

And this guy's only got a 10 foot reach. I don't know. Like, keep this like 10 feet.

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah. You can avoid that by... Using diagonals.

[Referee (James)]
That hits.

[Frogitha]
And then I will...

[Referee (James)]
Y'all stinging. Omega versus Venom mode. And then you have two action.

[Frogitha]
Alright, cool. That's just my turn.

[Landie (Nova)]
I will use my first action to stride. To here. I don't need to get behind it.

Although getting behind it means we don't get coned. I'm gonna get behind it. My second action, I will hit it.

Just regular hit. And with my last action, I will heal for 6 damage. Which is half of that.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Now it's my turn.

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes, it should be Mimosa's turn.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You should probably put her in the initiative so she can actually take her turn.

[Referee (James)]
How do you undo this? Nice!

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yay! Yay! She goes for the legs and then like...

I don't know. I don't know. Stabs.

Stabs up the chest. Stabs up the chest. She's short.

I don't... She brings it down to her level. And then stabs through the chest.

[Referee (James)]
Mimosa can just run straight under this thing. Use the...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Catch her eye. Catch the momentum. Swinging up with donkey tail wrapped around this thing's legs.

And just... Rip straight up. Magic does not return to life.

And there are 3 magical items on it. Along with... I want my femur!

[Landie (Nova)]
Your femur?

[Frogitha]
Yes! It belonged... It belonged to a dear friend.

You've gotten like 6 level 11 magic items so far. It belonged to a dear friend! I will not take any criticism!

[Referee (James)]
You could take the runes off and give those to somebody else.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, you guys can have the runes. I don't care. I want the femur.

I don't care if it's...

[Landie (Nova)]
Okay, let's put the runes on Mimosa's dagger then or something, yeah?

[Frogitha]
James, can you... If I put it back, can you do that?

[Referee (James)]
I think I can. So go ahead and put it back. Or put it in the party stash so everybody can look at it.

I'll just put everything in the party stash.

[Frogitha]
As long as I get the femur itself. I don't care.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, so this is definitely double. And then there's... 4 that you guys succeeded from.

Clear that. There we go.

[Frogitha]
Jesus Christ.

[Referee (James)]
You should be able to do that math really fast.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Identifying time, gang.

[Landie (Nova)]
I don't know if any of them are capable of rolling high enough to identify these. That mouth looks sick as hell.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well, uh... I'm sure Para might have something that could help. Let's see.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Overview, let's check.

[Referee (James)]
This is definitely above level for everybody.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Para has the highest in religion. But in terms of arcana... None of us are properly teaching.

That's fine.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You got really quiet all of a sudden.

[Frogitha]
What do I know about Flora? Is it easy to tell which... Which person they are?

Wasn't she your friend? Yes, but they... They all have things connected to them.

Yeah, they all have things connected to them. And I want to know which one this one is. Which person?

Is it person 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6?

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so let me go find...

[Frogitha]
That's also what I was referencing earlier. That's also what I was referencing earlier. When I was like, how did I get away?

Oh, I remember how I got away. Never mind.

[Referee (James)]
Flora ran away from a marriage to a noble at the altar. Let us proceed. Heal checks to chat.

[Landie (Nova)]
Names, can we have some magic bullshit to transfer the runes from the main gash to Mimosa's daggers? I don't know if there's anyone in... There's no one in Bronlock, near Bronlock, that is high enough level to do it.

[Referee (James)]
No, Lochte is. Or the rune carver. But it's gonna be...

I'm happy to provide you with magic bullshit. Especially for something like this. Oh my god, use a fucking heal point on that.

Jeez.

[Landie (Nova)]
Greta's tracking is like level 12, so if they're level 12, then that's fine.

[Referee (James)]
Holy shit.

[Frogitha]
Nice.

[Referee (James)]
Did that.

[Frogitha]
Is the femur ready to be taken?

[Referee (James)]
No. No, literally nobody's ready just yet. Alright, what was that?

That was on the lesser dragon plate. So let me click identify item.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
There you go. Well, that would explain why I got a 20.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Does Nova use heavy armor?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yes. She does.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Sick. Well, there you go.

[Landie (Nova)]
But I don't want to take everything. I'm happy with either the armor or the sword. And then we can sell...

I don't think either of you use swords or armor and parry incoming.

[Heart (Kamon)]
No, not heavy armor. If anything, I would need to take the stuff off it, but the stuff is kind of what makes it. Oh, what's that?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah, so... If someone would like the runes that's on the armor, then go for it. Like, that's cool.

I would rather the sword.

[Referee (James)]
If you guys want to pay... 20 gold, you can have the... item that you fail to identify, identified.

How much gold?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh, we haven't identified it yet.

[Referee (James)]
20. The sword hasn't been identified.

[Frogitha]
Why are you, like, so far away? You sound like you're in another room. They sound fine to me.

[Referee (James)]
No, they sound a little bit further.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Sick. Why did you get down to 59%?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
You were, like, all the way down from me. I don't know what happened.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
How dare you be turned down on Otter's End.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Unbelievable.

[Referee (James)]
My bad.

[Heart (Kamon)]
My deepest apologies. I failed to identify the sword while I'm at it.

[Referee (James)]
Oh yeah, you guys need to pay me some gold for it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Go into the box of shit.

[Referee (James)]
We're just going to pay some gold for it. Someone look at it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
How much does it cost? Because I also have this random, unusual object that I need.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Identify.

[Referee (James)]
20 gold. I think that guy might be able to do it for you as well.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah. Oh no. For the unusual sword.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
How about you? We weren't friends already?

[Landie (Nova)]
Yeah, that's what I just realized.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That's crazy.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I mean, to be fair, I always forget that the friends function works because it's like, we're in a server, of course we're friends.

[Landie (Nova)]
Even if you strip the runes off the plate armor, it's still dragon hide, which I would like.

[Referee (James)]
The thing is, as additional reward, because there's not many here, you guys can pick any... Whoever does not receive these items can pick one rune to copy off of these things, either for sale or for attaching to your own item.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh damn. That's some good armor.

[Heart (Kamon)]
So, as we are taking the many things off, we can divide this in a bit, but who wants what rune and who wants stuff?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I am good to go. If nobody takes the rat statue, I'll take it.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
That was from another adventure.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I don't know, I asked about it. Was it supposed to stay in the party stash? No clue.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
The rat statue stays in the party stash?

[Referee (James)]
No, that's from whoever has the rat statue. I will do a copy of... Actually, let's see.

There's plus two greater striking, nightmare, nightmare.

[Heart (Kamon)]
It's going to be hard for Paris.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
She's a caster. Hopefully she can find something. Armor is usually useful, but also we could take it for selling, so I could just sell it and get what I want out of it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Question, query, section part two. Flora's femur is missing its runes. Were those removed already?

[Landie (Nova)]
I didn't take them. I hope not.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, it's just... When I'm looking at it, it has none of the runes it had beforehand.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, it looks like the runes are gone.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Fuck. Uh-oh.

[Referee (James)]
What were they?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, I took them because they're mine.

[Landie (Nova)]
Oh, okay. Is that still happening?

[Referee (James)]
Hold on, can you tell me which runes were on there first?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yes, I can. I was under the impression I was getting everything from that.

[Referee (James)]
No worries.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Weapon potency plus two, greater striking, ashen, and nightmare.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay. That is all right. Just note them down somewhere in voiceover flow.

Okay, if you want one, you can have one. Oh, no, no, no. I don't use physical attacks.

I'm going to take the ones off the armor.

[Referee (James)]
The reason I say it is because you guys can still... So there's the items, and you can still do whatever you want with the runes on those items, but in addition to that, anybody who's not getting one of these three items, you can copy any of the runes and just have that transplanted onto anywhere here.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, okay, I'll put it in chat then.

[Referee (James)]
Nightmare, it's two. There's deathless, I think is the other one.

[Landie (Nova)]
Sorry to make you suffer. That's for the people not getting an item. They can replicate a rune.

Yep, okay. I'll claim the sword then, if that's okay with everyone, and then I'm done.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Ha! I am now the Magikarp. Fear my stinger.

[Frogitha]
I guess.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Exactly.

[Frogitha]
So do you fear now just a regular normal weapon?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Essentially, yeah.

[Frogitha]
Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and make it tiny, because the person who wielded it was tiny.

[Landie (Nova)]
What if the opposite happened and it made Seraph's peak?

[Referee (James)]
That'd be a really funny effect. What Mimosa could do is just copy one of the runes. If you're not taking the sword itself, you would take one of the runes and copy one of them.

The sword wouldn't lose both of them.

[Frogitha]
So it will have something on it?

[Referee (James)]
Unless you wanted to take both of them, because you wanted to sell one. That would totally be fine. I feel like, because it's midnight, I'm not explaining things correctly.

Don't worry. So the runes of these things exist, and you guys can do whatever the fuck you want with them. But also, anybody not getting an item, you can copy a rune.

[Frogitha]
I would like a rune on the femur, but I'm also just happy having the femur itself. Because with this, I think I can summon Flora's spirit to wield it.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, it works like Lottie. You know what I mean.

[Frogitha]
Lonnie.

[Referee (James)]
Lonnie!

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, so, now that that is out of the way, Mimosa has taken the runes from Flora's femur. Have any of them been copied off it as well, so there's a bonus rune for selling or whatever?

[Referee (James)]
Whoever's not... So who's taking the... Aeris is taking Flora's femur.

Who's taking the Bastard Sword? Nova. And who's taking the Lesser Dragonplate?

[Heart (Kamon)]
Also Nova, I believe.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'm not taking two. If someone takes it, if one of you take it, you can just have the runes off it or something.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Don't have it as... Yes, but the runes can be taken off separately. It's the armor itself, because it doesn't have...

[Landie (Nova)]
We're deciding who gets a double up of a rune, rather than the item itself.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay. The... So everyone who doesn't take a physical item can still take the runes and a copy of the rune bit, if I'm...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
If you're not getting an item, you get the copied rune. If you get an item, you don't get the copied rune. That is what I was understanding it as.

Because it was a case of there's not enough loot to go around, so whoever doesn't take an item gets...

[Referee (James)]
You can still strip the rune off that item. As normal. There's still normal items.

Not as a copy. Hold on. Don't strip it off.

To take it off of the item and do whatever you want.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ah, okay. Well, I'll... I'm fine with taking the armor to strip the runes off, unless Para needs runes off.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I'm okay taking a copy of the Greater Resilient rune.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
What about Deathless, since Kamen already has it?

[Heart (Kamon)]
No, this character doesn't. Sorry, I was mentioning it. Because Mysterio has the Deathless rune.

Okay.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's really between you two, I think.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well!

[Landie (Nova)]
It's Kamen's armor now. They can decide what they want to do with it later.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
There you go. Kamen got it.

[Landie (Nova)]
I got my sword. I have no claim on the armor. I get a juicy sword.

Large sword!

[Referee (James)]
Does anybody else have heavy armor proficiency?

[Landie (Nova)]
In the game, or here? It's here. Here?

I don't think so.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's pretty...

[Landie (Nova)]
fighters and champions.

[Referee (James)]
You could sell it for something fucking expensive.

[Landie (Nova)]
Then James will make fun of you for selling the cool loot.

[Referee (James)]
I will. I will do that.

[Heart (Kamon)]
The armor doesn't have a price slot. It's at 0 gold. Let me put it back in the...

Priceless!

[Landie (Nova)]
Let's just go out and buy like 6 of them if it costs nothing.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Let me put Lesser Great Dragonplate back in the party stash.

[Referee (James)]
It's a pro strat. How much does normal Dragonplate cost? 10,000?

So this is going to be 5,000. You motherfucker, when I enter that, don't reset it to 0 GP.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, I think it's because you have specific magic armor. If you unclick specific magic armor, what does it do to it? Ah, there it goes.

[Referee (James)]
It goes 5,000 and then goes up, I assume because of the rune. Okay. Or because of the Dragonblade.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Thank you for running.

[Referee (James)]
That was great. Nicely done. I hope one day I will get the hang of running fucking victory points in encounters.

[Frogitha]
It was fun. I liked the setup and everything.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Now you and all the fairies can breathe a little easier.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. Is it desperate?

[Referee (James)]
If the Huntsman pops back up... Yeah, the thing about the title is if the Huntsman pops back up, he's died twice so he's at... so he's going back at Wounded 2.

Well, technically Wounded 1 unless he waits like a season to recharge or not him, it's the whatever lord has access to him, in this case the Hag. But one last thing is that the little shadowy key that Miss Mimosa has been hauling around has a string attached to it that comes out of the... where the Nuclavees...

where the the lantern... something the revolt... the lantern on the night of the revolt died and it comes out of their chest and attaches itself to the key.

That becomes a second key.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Wait, I have two keys now?

[Referee (James)]
You have two keys, yeah. It's attached to the first one.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, where did I get the first key?

[Referee (James)]
The first key you got in the Catacombs of the Slula the candy band by the Hallowed Toriel scene.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Referee (James)]
That's the thing that nobody's identified up here. That's what you're talking about, right?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, yes I am! Yeah, the thing that she keeps asking to have identified. And nobody's helping me or telling me how to do it.

[Referee (James)]
Let me go check the... Where is it? Unusual object.

That's because there's nobody here currently who can identify it. You can, though, however, just ask somebody, especially with the gold that you have access to... Wait, no, the...

Yeah. Okay, at this point, there's like three different people that you can get in touch with. Korg and the Wizard is going to be getting in contact with you guys past the...

Oh, hey, it's 21st! Cool. Toriel scene attacks Mimosa's Hollow.

Torbell joins in, but on the side of Mimosa rather than on the side of Toriel scene. Toriel scene gets fucked up. And everybody between the different scholars available will be able to tell you that this is the Shadewither Key, which among other things lets you go to the Hollow that the three Plum Drops use as their primary base.

It's also the Hollow at the heart of Toriel scene. It's where the slua, the candy man, dumps his magic items as tribute to the hags. And this little side key, you can plug this into the Balefire of any Hollow.

Balefire for that matter. Either of these and go straight to the location that that's supposed to open. So in this case, Shadewither Key lets you go straight to the three Plum Drops.

And the new key that you've acquired lets you go straight to where the Huntsman uh, straight to where the Huntsman's heart is kept. And where he's regenerating.

[Frogitha]
And if we stab it.

[Landie (Nova)]
On camping time.

[Speaker 9]
Mhm. Get him.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
That can be for another time. Unless it can be real easy, I can just stab it now.

[Heart (Kamon)]
True. We'll probably get gone.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Because Mimosa wouldn't want to just let that Let that stew. Let that cook.

[Referee (James)]
With the Huntsman, it's also something where you could take the title out of them and try to give it back to them. It's all a matter of basically what curses have been laid on either object. Think of fucking with a title kind of the same way as fucking with a contract.

It would probably be an encounter similar to that to where there's traps laid on these things. Um, but killing killing him is probably easier for the hags to let you do because then they don't lose the title.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay. But also you can do that.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. That also means making sure you don't have to deal with this asshole is very worth it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay. Also, will you be able to um Identify Give me the unusual object or identify it? What's the word?

It's still unusual. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know. Let's see if you can make this DC 59 Arcana check. Nope.

Failed by 47. I'm sorry.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm asking who do I have to pay and do I have to pay it now? Do I get it now?

[Referee (James)]
No, you don't have to pay anybody. Let me press that button. There you go.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Woo!

[Frogitha]
Alright, folks. I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.

[Referee (James)]
I don't pick up my hours again for Sunday nights, so I get to focus on my real job. Oh yeah, James.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Can you go check the event that I posted and see if you are available for that time?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
And then also give me the second key unless it's attached to the shadow wizard key.

[Referee (James)]
Tuesday at 7pm high? I would be able to show up like two hours after that. After that start.

Unless That should be fine. I quit my work from home job. Which is a possibility.

Valid. They just cut out so they're like, well, we're reducing the after hours budget. I'm like, you're cutting specifically the night that I make the most sales every week.

Which is after two years of working for you people still disappointing but not unexpected. I don't think you guys actually looked at those numbers. I think you just picked me and said, well decrease his but this is why I got the management job to begin in real life.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Honestly, that would be a really funny adventure for mechanic to just show up randomly. It also be a really funny adventure for James to jump into the middle of it. Because by then the gimmick will have been revealed.

[Referee (James)]
Everyone, I think I figured this out.

[Landie (Nova)]
So excited to do more of the ballad of creation with you writing in that McCannon took the darkness inside. Luckily for McCannon, nothing gets to happen until it's written in the next book. But when that does happen it's so good.

James, can I do magic rune shifting things as well to move runes off the sword you gave me onto my sword? Yes. Because I realized the bastard sword is not reach so and it's also large so Nova could only use it while she's big.

They would go great with runes on my other sword that I already have. It's basically I need to rename my sword.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know if that makes it valuable outside of that.

[Landie (Nova)]
Hang on. Maybe I just get a new sword and I might have to spend some time getting them shifted over instead.

[Referee (James)]
You're good. My thing with this is if you guys want to move these around it's like the magic of the fame is the reward. If you guys want to transfer anything right now this is the place to do it.

[Landie (Nova)]
I would love to make my sword Cold Iron if I could do that too. The fame magic is not going to make it Cold Iron. That makes sense.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Can you give me something that you can't handle?

[Landie (Nova)]
I think the value of having a Dragonhide?

[Heart (Kamon)]
This is a joke. Do not take it seriously.

[Referee (James)]
Dragonhide is super fucking bad. That's half the cost of that item. I think somebody's going to sell that and they might get items for it.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah, yeah. That is what I'm doing. That's why I was kidding about the transfer of the Dragonhide.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Will I get that key later?

[Referee (James)]
One more time?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Will I get that key later at some point? Let me copy the key. You're my shinies.

Thank you so much. Also, Landy, Jack's tattered tape, can I just fix that? It doesn't need to stay tattered or dirty.

I can clean that.

[Landie (Nova)]
That's the magic item. You could have it in brackets repaired or something. Yes!

I don't see why that would stop it functioning as a magic item. It's from Springhill Jack. He is a British folklore in real life.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I don't know his purpose in the game, whether he was in an adventure path or it's just another- I think he shows up as extra information in a different one, because I remember reading about him in an adventure path that I was considering running, and we also had a friend who used him in one of our adventures. He might have shown up in the thing about cryptids because there was a whole book that had a bunch of cryptids. Yeah, Monsters of Myth.

[Landie (Nova)]
Monsters of Myth, yep. I just looked at that. Let's see.

So Nova can take the potency, the greater striking, and nightmare off it, which would leave it just as a cold iron bastard sword.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, so which key goes to which?

[Referee (James)]
The plum pitched skeleton key.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You're doing it for me! Okay.

[Referee (James)]
It also functions as a skeleton key.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay, cool. I will let you do what you're gonna do then.

[Referee (James)]
Since everything else is settled, I'm going to- wait, who took the armor? Heart. Okay, alright, cool.

And then, Hera, you're gonna get one other thing. Possibly common as well.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, I took a rune.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, you're gonna get one other thing and possibly common as well.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, okay. Can I get two things?

[Referee (James)]
It's going to be, it's a special thing. I don't think, if Cavan sells the thing, I think it's probably not because it's a lot of fucking money.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh no! I just saw the curse act.

[Referee (James)]
What does the curse say?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's a shade with a key. You're not an elf, so you don't have to worry about it. But if you ever want to fuck up an elf, just give that to them.

Okay.

[Speaker 9]
Super true.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh my god.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I was like, this is really cool. Wait a minute, it's cursed.

[Referee (James)]
The Obnubilate curse, which makes you nubile, is the elf's curse.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It's the main item in Gatewalkers, at least the first one, of which I was playing an elf, so that was fun. I didn't get that far though, I never saw the key.

[Heart (Kamon)]
You don't have to worry about me in terms of extra items because I'm most definitely selling that dragonhide to get stuff.

[Referee (James)]
Oh yeah. And you have enough money for something like that, if you want to buy something you don't really have to worry about availability, uh it might be a slight surcharge, but once we're operating at that amount of gold, I'm like, alright, just expedite.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Where does the pump pit key take me to? Oh.

[Referee (James)]
The plum drops are above where you'll seem. Oh. When burned within a hellfire, opens a gate there on skin or I call it stables.

That seems sufficiently dehumanizing for X. I'm gonna adjust the shade wither key in a similar fashion.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Cool, cool, cool, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Otherwise, this is basically a key of killing elves. This other one. The shade wither key is a key of killing elves and having a plus one bonus to whatchamacallit.

The plum pit skeleton key also works just as like a regular skeleton key.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Cool.

[Referee (James)]
This one opens to the cauldron stables, this one uh, huntsman stables, this one opens to their cauldron room. Otherwise known as their boss fight room. Unless one or two of them are dead.

Or just not there. In which case it's their bullying room.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Alright, so we gotta figure out their schedule and then just slip in.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ooh. This key is cool.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, this is. Okay.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I still have all of the manuscript pages. Do I need those? Sorry.

[Landie (Nova)]
If you ever want to save them again, I have them in a...

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Okay.

[Landie (Nova)]
I assume they're all archived in the... when the game got compendiumed.

[Speaker 9]
Cool.

[Referee (James)]
Where is... I'm gonna drop this in your inventory. Wait.

[Frogitha]
No, it's being airdropped.

[Referee (James)]
It doesn't have the consumable tab.

[Frogitha]
Baby, what's doing awake, baby?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It does have the talisman though and talismans don't.

[Referee (James)]
Talismans are consumable. Alright. One of the little things that you transform, one of the toadstools that you transformed earlier is gonna pop itself into a...

Transform itself into a toadstool wreath. Still has that little draconic image, fresco, sculpted shape. Whatever the appropriate term for that would be here at the front.

And you hear the voice of, I guess not Abzu, but Flanger was the name of the dragon from the previous campaign. Thanks for saving them all.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Of course.

[Referee (James)]
Do it again. And again, and again, and again, and you just keep hearing that sound until it fades into a really pleasant, like his voice isn't so much heard as felt. It's like a warm breath that vibrates you.

Like a pleasant summer's day was also a massage chair. Just gentle enough to not like rattle your bones. Or whatever that spell is.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Bone shaker.

[Referee (James)]
Bone shaker.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Little critter saga.

[Referee (James)]
Violent crackle. 100 unskilled violent creep.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
It was basically just saying that parrots should keep healing people over and over. Does it tickle?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Do they like it?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Hey Landy, if something has an imminence...

[Landie (Nova)]
That is an exemplar ability I believe.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, if the item is imminence does that mean that doesn't work for anyone else?

[Referee (James)]
I can edit it. It's gonna work for you, but tell me what I need to do to make that happen.

[Landie (Nova)]
It depends on the... if it has a transcendence action. Ah, it's that.

Yes, you don't get any of the benefits of that without having a spark of divinity. Which is the exemplar class ability.

[Referee (James)]
What's a transcendence action?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
The exemplar thing.

[Landie (Nova)]
You're basically giving... If you're giving Parrot access to this item, you're giving her a free dedication in exemplar. Which is fine.

[Referee (James)]
I just want you to know what you're doing. It's not like the feat, it's not the... It's not the full open access to the exemplar class.

[Landie (Nova)]
The dedication's fairly balanced. You get one specific thing. The easiest way to do this would be to give Parrot then the exemplar dedication as a bonus feat.

And her icon would be the victor's wreath. But then that screws her if she wants to actually take exemplar dedication without the victor's wreath.

[Referee (James)]
What does the action actually do? Or what does it normally take to do?

[Landie (Nova)]
So, exemplars have a spark of divinity. I can post this in chat, but it's a pretty big read. So basically, your spark is either in one of your enchanted items.

Nova has Barrow's Edge, which is her sword. She has Scar of the Survivor, so it's imbued in her skin. And she has the Skybearer's Belt, so it's imbued in her belt.

And she can move her spark of imminence between those three items into herself, where it does nothing. While it's in each item, the item becomes active with the imminence effect. And then she can do the transcendence action, which would then move the spark of imminence.

So, say if Parra had the Victor's Wraith, and then used the transcendence action, she would then need to spend an action to shift the spark back to her wraith to get the benefits of the imminence again.

[Referee (James)]
There's one imminence, one transcendence ability, but you can do blah blah blah. So, what does it take to do that transcendence? Like, what resource are you?

Oh, shift it. Alright.

[Landie (Nova)]
So, the transcendence you can transcend an item that has your imminence. Sorry, it has your spark. So, if an item doesn't have the spark in it, you need to get the spark into it, then you can transcend it again.

You can transcend once per round.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. If I did something like a free...

[Landie (Nova)]
If you gave Parra the Exemplar Dedication for free, it would give her the ability to do all of this. It's part of the dedication.

[Referee (James)]
That's true, but that's also like the Exemplar. I don't know, like, Parra, are you interested in the Exemplar Dedication?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I mean, it's very melee focused, which is not what I'm doing with Parra. But if it's free, and it doesn't interrupt anything else I'm doing, then I'm not as worried about it. As long as I can keep my Witchalyst.

So, because I think I need to...

[Referee (James)]
I think that'd be appropriate. Holy shit, you're close to level 7.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, I know. I was kind of hoping this would pop it up.

[Referee (James)]
If you guys, if you had to be a dickhead, if you guys had done the 5th round, you would be even closer. If not, have maybe would have hit it. 5 is a lot, though.

I'm not going to... Do I get it? I should start with 3.

But I was thinking in terms of if they fail some, then alright, 5 means they can keep going and maybe get to 3. Because I think you guys primarily won that because of... I feel like this is right.

I feel like you guys primarily won that thanks to the Frightened at the beginning.

[Landie (Nova)]
Probably. Maybe. I think I rolled 2, not 20, so I think it was mostly luck.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, I know. I shouldn't be clicking that. If you...

or you might have to redo that. If you would like to, you can add example or dedication to suppose.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
What did you do?

[Referee (James)]
I... selected... I selected Victor's Wreath as the thing, but then there were other options.

I was like, alright, what if I tried clicking out of it?

[Landie (Nova)]
You just have to delete the dedication and add it in again.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't want to make the other selections. I was like, ah, fuck.

[Landie (Nova)]
So you can make the icon a headband you already have, or I think you get the option to create a new item, which is probably where you got stuck.

[Referee (James)]
Exactly. So if there was a desire to create a new item, then I didn't want to.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well, I can put it in her sexy little collar that I gave her for no reason.

[Landie (Nova)]
The purpose for that is because your icon can exist in a magic item as well. Victor's Wreath.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I've forgotten the name of the class.

[Landie (Nova)]
Exemplar?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Exemplar, there we go.

[Speaker 9]
It starts with a D.

[Referee (James)]
Exemplar.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Icon is Victor's Wreath. What item do I want me to have my icon? I will just select an item.

Um... I mean, the thing that makes the most sense would be her religious symbol, but also...

[Landie (Nova)]
Doesn't really matter, but it does specifically need to be headwear. I guess it doesn't really matter. It's to do with weapon icons mostly.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I mean, it says a metal that hangs from your neck.

[Landie (Nova)]
Neck? Oh, never mind then. I guess it's a necklace.

I just assumed it was a headwear.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
How many belts go around your neck? I mean, are we guessed on here?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Oh, that was it. What is a belt around the neck?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Cool. And then it just automatically goes in there. Awesome.

[Referee (James)]
I'm starting a cult, so I gotta go look up those cult rules again.

[Landie (Nova)]
I'm sure there'll be no downside to adding like every subsystem from every adventure to your game.

[Referee (James)]
I'm gonna... It's all downside. The organizations, ironically, I'm not focusing on the Kingmaker terms right now, the organizations are like, I can roll a d20 and I can resolve this.

And Kingmaker is like really in retrospect obviously not that.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, Kingmaker is kind of like its own thing. Almost has to be the focus of the entire campaign.

[Referee (James)]
When you originally said that, what I was hoping hoping against hope was that that would mean that it was real easy to draw the rest of the campaign into its focus. That's like my rose-tinted ears. As opposed to what you meant and what was the reality, which was that this is in fact an entirely separate game that has not really been made to interface with Pathfinder.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I'm learning that most people give up on the kingdom halfway through Kingmaker, which feels a little silly.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It's not user-friendly.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah. Especially when only one person is actually interacting with it.

[Referee (James)]
And there's no way to automate it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I'm ignoring you right now.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well, because it's not meant to be automated. If you automate it, you're just using the base rules of like, we're not doing this. Automate the kingdom, and it's literally just like, okay, here's what the kingdom does while your players aren't around.

There's no rolling for it or anything, because it's just your players aren't in control anymore. It's the GM.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I don't mind doing it, it's just not user-friendly for me.

[Referee (James)]
Well, when I say automated, that's what I mean.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
There's no sneak-peeks or like...

[Referee (James)]
Like, hey, I'm gonna be low on resources this month. Make that take care of that.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I did see a... Yeah. I did see that someone had it set up so their players had automatic, like, this is the choice they're making every single time.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah!

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Which is easier to do when you are... I'll see if I can find that. God, I don't remember where it is.

It's probably in my history in Reddit. I thought it was really interesting, and I considered it for my group. And then my group maybe, possibly might not stay, so...

We'll see.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Someday. Someday we'll get there.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, because one of them has a job and might not be available on Fridays anymore.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
But we won't know until it becomes a pattern.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, and they won't leave until it becomes a pattern.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It becomes a problem. They'd still try to keep playing it even when it became a problem.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
They would be like, I can still play for two hours.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
As they like to be able to have all the things.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Let's see. History. Where's my history?

[Referee (James)]
Probably one of the most, like, VTT automation is like, hey, can there be something for... It'd be really cool if there was something that, like, when you were ready to play, reminded you, like, hey, did you, like, spend some money on, like, in and food and stuff like that? And then...

And then if it was like, well, no, then it gave you the opportunity that, hey, well, you can... If you didn't want to have spent money on this, what you could have done was done subsist action. Do you want to give that a try?

And that would make up for this many days. The way people normally automate it is like, okay, uh, here's my module, it's automated, uh, in keep, and ration tracker. And then you log in seven days later, your character's dead.

Your character's dead, because he didn't eat anything. It's auto.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, history. Can I search my history? I can clear my history, that's not what I want.

No!

[Speaker 9]
Lost forever.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Is it gonna... Hang on, I gotta scroll through all this Minecraft shit.

[Speaker 9]
Where else?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Um... Okay. Turns out there's a limit to how much of my history I can actually see.

Damn. Oh wait, no, it's recent. Okay.

Well, I didn't upvote anything, so... I guess it only saved a whittle bit. How tragic.

[Frogitha]
What you looking for?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Um, I found some... something on the Kingmaker. Um...

Ooh, actually, hang on, I might have... I might have found it. Because I remembered that I was searching up quick rules.

Um... Quick rules, party on.

[Speaker 9]
Excellent.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
No, that wasn't the right one. Um... Someone reduced the number of actions that each player gets, which is really funny.

To make it feel better, they reduced the actions.

[Speaker 8]
Um...

[Otterstar (Perra)]
God, I don't know where that post was. I do know that there are some actions that are actually really useful. Uh, oh, is it this one?

Yes, it's this one. Okay. Alright.

Um... I love that it sounds like Heart is just hiring everybody in the cult. Isn't it great?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Like, what an easy way.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I'm not quite sure how to do it legitimately, because yeah, if you pay them, eventually they'll stick around long enough that they're like, this is nice. But I'm not sure how to do it legitimately, outside the paying people thing.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You pay them, and then you start making it a multi-level marketing scheme.

[Referee (James)]
Of course, of course. I need rules advice.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, this is the one that I was reading where they talk about it. The players have default activities they do unless something pushes them to do something else, like a priority list. Reduce unrest, collect taxes every second turn, etc, etc.

Then they trust me to make the rules. Our defaults is to always use fame on a crit fail, on a fail, blah blah blah. There is an action that I found is actually really useful that nobody took because there's so so so so so so so many leadership actions that it's almost impossible to read through them all and understand them all.

Especially when my players refuse to read the actions all on their own.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Feeling a lot of shade right now.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well, I can't understand things for people to know.

[Referee (James)]
That's why Maelstrom is looking at you. That's funny.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I mean, the problem, I don't know, you had a list of it, right? Yes.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
There's a list of leadership actions, but unfortunately I don't, I think you're the only one who's actually willing to go through and try and read them all, but also it's like I wish there was a list of them and then a small description rather than a full one to just explain the basics of what it's for. Not even how it works, just what is it for? Because so many of them are so long that my players are going to read three words and go, fuck this.

But the useful ones are creative solutions, which effectively give you hero points for your kingdom, and also the magical version which was... Oh, where are you? Where are you, bitch?

There's a magical version of creative solution which I can't find the name of. I would think it was called magical solution, but it's not in here.

[Referee (James)]
There's ones that are like... that are for all intents and purposes uh... for all intents and purposes, they are defaults.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Oh, the magical one is called prognostication.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's very indicative of what it's... Because the writers were up their own ass and the word reminded them.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
And then there's some that apparently are specific to different characters. That's fun. Supernatural solution, there we go, that's the other magical one.

That's the one I was looking for. There's creative solution and then supernatural solution. And those are the ones that give you experience if you still have some left over at the end of your turn.

So if you don't need your hero points they get turned into experience, which I think is cool. But I give out hero points too much to count that for people. That would be a fun alternative rule to do at some point though.

And then there's RPG bot which is where I usually go to get the quick rules and stuff, but theirs is also really dense. I don't think you can get away with it not being dense. But they do the handy thing of highlighting which ones why things aren't as useful.

Though I think it's really funny that the one that I think my players chose isn't in the list of one of them.

[Heart (Kamon)]
RPG bot's great, but on occasion they miss one thing and you're like hmm, should I be picking that?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Cause they have Despotism, Feudalism, Oligarchy, Republic, and Thaumacracy. But they didn't mention the one we have which is the Yeomanry. So I don't know what their opinion on the Yeomanry is, but it's fine because that's what my players wanted.

[Heart (Kamon)]
What is Yeomanry? I don't think I've heard that before.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Have you ever played Icewind Dale?

[Heart (Kamon)]
I did for exactly one session so you're gonna have to tell me.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Okay, so basically a Yeomanry is a series of towns that all have their own government but they're all in agreement to meet and talk, basically. Each town has its own government, but they do all get together and have a counseling session or something.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, that's cool.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
So it's like they're all in agreement that they are part of the same thing but they're still pretty independent on their own.

[Referee (James)]
Yep. Like Anarchist Ireland or Greenland or Iceland, for instance. In like a very loose sense.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Basically like local government organizations, like bottom up, if that makes sense.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Exemplar actually makes very, it's very funny to me because that is kind of the essence of what I was doing with Perrin's build. It's just I didn't like the features of Exemplar. Because it's very melee focused and that's not what I do.

[Referee (James)]
Well there you have something that's not me. I saw that wreath and I'm like, huh, that's like very fitting and appropriate. It's a very cool reward.

[Landie (Nova)]
But yeah, there is not a lot of stuff in Exemplar that lends itself to healing. That wreath is nice, but I guess there's also the water skin that you get that lets you share potions.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
See, I have to bully James into giving me a relic.

[Referee (James)]
Yes. But I also have to give James the magic item. Plus greater striking.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
So the relics are fun because you can give them, you can put them on a regular item and then they slowly grow as they level up and I like that. Oh yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Let's see.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
The one that I really want is the life stuff. All of it. I don't remember which one the life was.

Where's my stuff? Where is it? Relic aspects, there we go.

Because I know it was one that I... did we give it to Carvey? What?

Sorry, what are you talking about? Oh, the vitality siphon. This.

Oh, hang on. This is the main thing that I want out of it because I think this is such a cool thing. So as a reaction, if you or if an ally within 60 feet gains more hit points than it's currently down, you can send the leftovers to another person.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
And that is so cool.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That is very fun.

[Referee (James)]
That's huge.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Random... Oh, you're pointing. Okay, hello.

You guys were talking about mythic points a while back. How's that discussion going? It sucks.

Don't do it. It's a trap.

[Referee (James)]
For some reason they took out the... for some reason the... Well, two things happen.

Basically, they take the functionality of hero points and they take it out of mythic points, but they also put it into an action that you must use mythic points to spend in order to do which works exactly the same except for attack roll. No longer use the attack roll.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
You can't re-roll in an attack roll, but you can re-roll in other stuff. And sure, yeah, you do get a special thing and you're special or whatever, but...

[Heart (Kamon)]
Well, I imagine you could always just have hero points and mythic points, right? Nope.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
No, they replace.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Mythic points replace. They use the same little three dots as heroes. So you can't, like, homebrew shenanigans it.

Okay.

[Referee (James)]
No. There was a thought where I had a thought that that would work well as a gift to basically have hero points back or to use them on the same things. Probably what I will actually do is just say you can use...

Did you pick him up in the box?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Wolf! That's his throne. He needs to be carried in the box.

[Referee (James)]
Let's see.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
How else are you going to carry a cat in a box?

[Referee (James)]
Probably what it will be easier to do is say, okay, we're giving mythic points the functionality of hero points again and doing that as a gift.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah. It's not bad. I'm just whining because, like, you do get some cool stuff.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I did take a look about the mythic paths a while ago. I downloaded the PDF for them and they're cool. I can see why the hero points thing is like, you know.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, it's annoying but, like, you do get cool stuff. You can use it during battle. My cool stuff is not used during battle.

I can just take, like, a loaf of bread and feed a hundred people using a mythic point because I'm going with the weird Eldritch Fae leshy god.

[Heart (Kamon)]
So, yeah. It should be that. I might have to re-read because it's been a while so I've forgotten completely about that.

I do remember seeing the godling one and being like, whoa.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Yeah. Very cool.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
I was going to make her a beastmaster but then everyone was like, what if you just made this weird creature a god? She's going to be mad.

[Referee (James)]
That's one that meshes well. Because it meshes at all.

[Heart (Kamon)]
If I recall correctly, you can be stuff like an archdemon, an angel. The thing is about the angel one, it's like, why be angel when you can be a god, hmm?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well, if you don't want to be a god. They do different things.

[Heart (Kamon)]
That's true. It's like what the character would want. True, true.

So, if I recall correctly, the ending lines to it is godling, archdemon, the celestial being thing, the magic spell one where you just become a font of magic and I think king slash monarch.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Was there another one? There's also one that's like a grand warrior.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, there's the apocalypse rider, the archfiend, the ascended celestial, the beast lord, the broken chain, which is the... Is this the tyrant or is this the one, this is the rebel leader. Yeah, this is the rebel leader.

The eternal legend, the godling, the prophesized monarch, the wild spell, and that's it. Yeah. Which are all very cool.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, then there's a bunch of stuff you can do to... Oh god, god. Tailor it, excuse me, to you.

[Heart (Kamon)]
It worked a bit like, what's it, an archetype thing, no?

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Okay, I'll have to re-read up on it.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
It does balance out, it's just it stinks.

[Heart (Kamon)]
It's just the hero point thing is getting your go.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
But you start off with three mythic points that you can use however you want. Hmm.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ascended celestial.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Except for attack rolls.

[Heart (Kamon)]
So if it wasn't for that one thing, you would be more on board.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. I hardly ever use hero points to reroll stuff anyway, so.

Hmm. Hmm.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Frankly, I keep hold of them in case I go down. I've been hit far too many times to not hold one.

[Referee (James)]
The first thing I picked up was that living vessel shit. I was like, oh, if I get knocked down, I immediately gain one hit point and don't die.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
So valid.

[Heart (Kamon)]
So cool. I like the eternal legend thing that you can just keep coming back as long as people are talking about you.

[Nessie (Mimosa)]
Yeah, isn't that cool? It was between godling and the eternal legend that they were thinking for my character.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Hmm. Valid, valid. When I was now looking at eternal monarch, most of them have some sort of revivability of sorts.

And I do find it funny that with the living monarch one, you can pull a King Arthur, basically.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Well, yeah, that's what it's based off of.

[Heart (Kamon)]
Ah, that makes sense! Or you can be a sort of fascinating thing where one of your knights can just become king. It's not quite possession, but it's just sort of, you know.

Yeah. Hmm. And become you for all intents and purposes.

Nevermind, it is a little like possession.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, the godling also has a very possession. Like, if you die, you become a deity and you can possess a body that has the same stats that you had before you died. The ascended celestial is really funny because effectively you just become a child again and instead of being revived right away, you have to go through life again.

[Heart (Kamon)]
There's the living monarch one also has one like that. If none of the knights decide to take up your mantle, you become a kid as well. If they're just like, no, I'm good, actually.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, which seems very ineffective for a campaign where you have to be this. Hope you don't die, otherwise it's going to be a while before the campaign can pick up again.

[Heart (Kamon)]
I imagine then if your characters are just very, very long-living types and it takes course over a couple years, but still, it would be annoying to miss out, I guess, two decades.

[Landie (Nova)]
I assume you just have all of your stats as a baby, so you're just a really strong baby.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I saw an anime that was apparently like that. Which one? I don't know.

I just remember there was an anime where there was a baby fighting a giant wolf.

[Landie (Nova)]
It ends up just being superpowered rugrats.

[Referee (James)]
That's a good answer. That was the only correct one.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I still can't believe I didn't realize that I couldn't actually cast reincarnate.

[Landie (Nova)]
So who did reincarnate Guji then?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I can do reincarnate if I get to level 8, because then I can take expert in nature. But also, do I want to do that?

[Landie (Nova)]
Resurrect at that level anyway?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
I think resurrect won't be until level 9. Because it's a 5th rank instead of a 4th rank. Level 9 is when I would get access to resurrect.

So, alas. Alas.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, at your current rate, that's not so far away. What? At your current rate, that's not so far away.

How's the level 7?

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Yeah, at some point we gotta go back to Salial Spire. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
I'm excited you guys are at those levels. I'm getting close at the very least. But I am going to hop off.

Thank you all so much for hanging out. Get Tentacle Potion! Get that out of here.

Get that out of here. Unbelievable. Alright folks, I will see you later.

Thank you so much for playing. It was a pleasure as always. Thank you for running.

[Otterstar (Perra)]
Hell yeah.

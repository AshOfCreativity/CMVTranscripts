[Speaker 4]
End of him.

[Frogitha]
Hold on, I'm gonna leave really quickly and then rejoin.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
I can't stop you. Damn it. There's supposed to be a frog noise that happens when I leave and- when I- when I rejoin- or when I join in general.

What the fuck?

[Speaker 4]
How's it work? Yeah. It's on.

Poor guy's image, very cool.

[Frogitha]
All right, let me try that again. Damn, you must have it disabled or something in the server.

[Speaker 4]
Really? What, like, what's the- what's the setting?

[Frogitha]
Um, so in voice and video, soundboard, um, entrance sound. Choose a soundboard sound to automatically play whenever you join a voice- a voice channel.

[Speaker 5]
Um, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Let me see if I can change that sound. You said- okay, here we go.

[Referee (James)]
I allow- allow members to use sound from other servers if they're a Discord Nitro member.

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Save.

[Frogitha]
Okay. Yes! I was so happy about that.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't know that was a thing.

[Frogitha]
I didn't either until I started fucking around with Nitro stuff. Um, I got Nitro because Xbox gave, like, a free three-month thing, so I had to do it.

[Speaker 4]
Absolutely. Create scene.

[Referee (James)]
I put a bunch of scenes in the- I basically shoved everything to the back room so it's still in the server and we could pull it out if we need to, but it's not, like, loading everything all at once. I deleted a bunch of files that were not in use, so I think it could just load properly now.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I have a feeling I'm gonna- Arsene's Goblin's gonna die whenever I play them.

[Frogitha]
Not for good, unless you, like, incinerate them. But, I mean, well, the problem is everybody- everybody else has, like, higher levels, so it's hard to get in with a new character.

[Referee (James)]
I feel like that's what a lot of people did, was they intentionally started throwing their low levels in just to- just to have those, uh, gummy thick meat shields around them.

[Speaker 4]
Presidential escort. Secret service.

[Frogitha]
Um, Scooter is making a character that's- you know those people that walk around in, like, they're- they're bodyguards, but they have fake arms so that they can quickdraw?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah!

[Frogitha]
He's making that. Okay. So he's making a gunslinger.

[Speaker 4]
By wooden prosthetic. Yeah. I have his fake hand is another gun.

Um, I didn't mean that.

[Frogitha]
I think we should tag people and see if they want to join, because if not, I don't know if we'll have a game on our hands.

[Speaker 4]
I can- I can do it with two people, especially if it's very- this is a useful base in which people do have, uh, higher level characters.

[Frogitha]
It'd have to be a competent character, like, mentally. Because Arsene's Goblin ain't- ain't that.

[Speaker 4]
He would just be two idiots stumbling around. With fire. With multiple characters.

That's what multiple characters are. Ah, yeah, yeah. Hello.

Welcome. I don't know why, I didn't think James was in here. Well, I bounced for, like, a little while.

I thought it was, uh, Frog Arthur and, um, Thingy. And I was like, oh yeah, I'll just wait for James to jump in and I'll- Order is set for between 7 to 8 p.m. Okay, that's totally fine.

[Referee (James)]
My work from home boss, who I've been desperately trying to tell, hey, if you call people from- people have spam blockers because they just get non-stop calls from, like, two towns in the southern region of India are responsible for, like, 90% of our spam calls. So everybody has spam callers or spam blockers. The way a spam blocker works is it says, hey, uh, have you never had any communication or contact with this person before?

Well, Verizon will tell you it's probably spam.

[Frogitha]
You can actually report people's numbers as spam. I- I've debated doing that to people that I don't like.

[Referee (James)]
But if you don't like the people, what you do is you sign them up for any kind- Sign them up for- Scientology.

[Frogitha]
Anything that sells people. Sign them up for Scientology. It's, like, $25 to start and then it follows them for the rest of their life.

In addition to that, you can sign them up to- if you know their address, you can sign them up to get, like, a shitload of free Bibles from, like, every single website that offers it. So it's non-stop things being sent to them.

[Speaker 5]
That's hilarious.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't even think of that.

[Verr]
The worst one is sometimes they don't- Some require, like, signatures. So they'll get, like, messages saying, Hey, you got a parcel here and you're going to come get it. You have to go there and get a free Bible.

Oh no.

[Referee (James)]
A very angry delivery with a very confused UPS guy.

[Frogitha]
Like, why is this- Dude, I- My mom's business partner that fucked me over with my pet sitting business, she just didn't want to pay me.

[Referee (James)]
What the fuck?

[Frogitha]
Yeah. All right.

[Referee (James)]
So I was, like, I was- Do you need somebody to, like, kill some people at this point? Like, you tell me stories sometimes and I'm like, you should- It can be done.

[Frogitha]
You know, look, her- I'm okay with her living longer because her muscles are calcifying and turning into bones. So, you know, I- yeah. So I'm good with her living as long as she possibly can.

Um, but she, uh, she fucked me over. I, um, I was gonna- I babysat for her and pet sat for her at once. And I only charged $50 for the whole service.

Okay. Um, and she didn't want to pay me. Exactly.

And she didn't want to pay me. So I- that was my- you know what? I'm not doing this.

Um, in addition to that, she- she would, like, take so long to pay me. Yeah, I was- I was not gonna do that anymore. Um, but she- she somehow has been using my number to sign up for, um, like, graphic design stuff.

So I've been getting calls from these people being like, hey, do you do graphic design artists? Like, you know, here's some promo stuff. And, like, it's just people calling me asking for her because she used her name.

I don't- I don't get it at all. So I've been getting these fucking calls.

[Referee (James)]
That's what- that's exactly what happens to some of these people who do a work from home job is selling pest control. And oftentimes people just put in- people just scrape numbers for any reason at all. People scrape numbers for any reason at all.

Anything that's plausibly make- there are services that will pay other people who provide services to feed them phone numbers for people who supposedly are just- are interested in, like, pest control or plumbing or carpentry, things like that. And a lot of them are fake because they get, like, you know, if they charge us $50 for- for the lead, then whoever they pay- whoever they pay for that lead is probably getting like 20 or 30 bucks or something like that. And so what they do- they will often just put fake people in there because it's good for- good for everybody up that chain until it gets to us.

They will just put fake numbers in. If you really want to piss people off- this is where the other ones come from- if you really want to piss people off, health insurance, pest control, you will get calls nonstop.

[Speaker 4]
Put into anything that's like, I'm looking for a quote, car insurance, anything.

[Frogitha]
Yeah. My mom did something with an LLC and- I feel that's actually illegal.

[Verr]
Like, I'm pretty sure there's, like, a law against that in America.

[Frogitha]
Probably.

[Speaker 4]
Not prosecuted, though. Everybody gets spam calls all day long. Yeah.

You don't know who did it. What was the LLC thing?

[Frogitha]
She- so, like I said, this was her business partner and they got an LLC for their business and she, like, inquired about credit card and insurance and loans and stuff like that for the business. And that is going to haunt her until she dies. Like, she's going to get calls about that until the day she croaks.

[Referee (James)]
Oh boy.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, so she actually got a credit card or she was, like, looking for one?

[Frogitha]
I don't exactly know. I don't think they got a credit card at all. But I think it was more like insurance and loans and stuff like that.

I'm not entirely sure. I wasn't big on the finance stuff. But I'm so- she just got out of this business.

She just got out of it because we found out- one, this business partner was, like, a control freak and a narcissist. We found out she scammed new mothers out of thousands of dollars at one point when she was doing a doula business. She scammed a lady who was having twins out of thousands of dollars.

And multiple people said the same thing about her doula business. In addition to that, she's always having people- people hack her account, her bank account, and then she can't pay for the trips that she's- that she's going on with other people. So they have to pay while they're there.

[Referee (James)]
Interesting.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
So- I wonder who's hacking that bank account.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, nobody's hacking it. This bitch is just a fucking grifter. I- I could rage all day about my disdain for her.

[Speaker 4]
You gotta kill these people at some point. I'm sorry.

[Frogitha]
Look, if she became a paraplegic tomorrow, I would uber over to her house just to laugh at her through the fucking window. I hate this bitch. I hate her so much.

Ugh.

[Speaker 4]
You're all fucking deserved.

[Frogitha]
She's also abusive to her boyfriend. Um, so- Oh, I'm sure. Yeah.

So that's another thing. She's just not a good person. I seem to surround myself with people that are just not good.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sometimes it's just- If you- if you grow up around them, it's very difficult to get away.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I had to move 1400 miles to get out of there, and it didn't work.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, I'm thinking that might be my- I might have to be doing the same thing. But I'm gonna be moving to the mountains, so- Maybe I'll encounter better people there. Or worse people, I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
Depends on which mountains. Appalachia. Yeah, that's fine.

Let's see. Blue Mountains, Smoky Mountains, Appalachians, anything- anything that trail, you're good to go. Rockies, no.

[Frogitha]
There's a nice, um, Cherokee, like, weed dispensary near where I'm gonna be. And it's gonna torture me for months because I- I won't be able to touch it until I'm done with the program. And then I'm gonna go on a weed bender.

Oh my god, I'm gonna get so high.

[Verr]
Oh no. I thought you said wave, like- Weed. Like loom?

[Frogitha]
Marijuana.

[Verr]
No, it's like the hair. Yeah, it's like there's a nice wave that's supposed to be nearby. I'm like, what is a wave dispensary?

It's like, uh, like, are you gonna do some, like, looming jokes or something like that?

[Speaker 4]
They wrap you up like fucking Rapunzel.

[Verr]
I mean, I've heard some weird things in America, so I mean, I'm not gonna question it.

[Referee (James)]
But- That's- I mean, that's par for the course in Philadelphia. They just have long weaves. And they get in car accidents because they get all wound up in the- It's bad, man.

Daniel. It's bad. And then the wheels keep spinning.

They just keep driving because they're used to it at this point. So the person goes flying around it. They usually- the weave usually releases right as they're on an upswing.

So you'll see people going right over the- right over the Liberty Bell.

[Speaker 4]
Slingshotting. Bald slingshot. Uh, ow, fuck.

Rough. Nobody tells- nobody tells you- as a man with long hair, they never tell you about shit.

[Referee (James)]
Like, hey, don't put your hair in a fucking ponytail all the time.

[Speaker 4]
You're gonna give yourself, like, torsion elk. You're gonna yank your fucking hair out. Hey, you have to detangle it.

Nah, I guess I could just fill it for a weave.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so what we were gonna get to earlier. I don't know how, like, more energetic now that I've had even less sleep, but what we were gonna get to earlier was these two gentlemen. I believe they're Arthur and Jim.

Arthur- Arthur and Jimmy.

[Frogitha]
Are those the two fuckwads that we tortured for an entire session?

[Referee (James)]
That is correct.

[Frogitha]
They were the only guys in the session?

[Referee (James)]
They were the only- yeah. Because I was the only guy in the session. I was getting tortured.

[Speaker 4]
In, like, a funny way. We leaned into it. What is- They explained to you guys, hey, we're doing really well this time around.

[Referee (James)]
By the way, if either of you want to bring along additional characters, that's totally fine. If you want to have, like, a bodyguard for Arsonist Goblin, that is- that is good.

[Speaker 4]
And I might even recommend it.

[Frogitha]
What is the level cap?

[Speaker 4]
What level do you have?

[Frogitha]
My lowest level is level three, except I- I don't- I don't really want to play Karis. Oh, and then level four.

[Speaker 4]
That's tricky. There's Gravekeeper Enid. Who's that?

[Frogitha]
I never finished setting that one up, actually. I never gave her spells or anything. She doesn't even have equipment.

I was gonna rename her, but I- to, like, delete or something. But that's, um, that is my old lady character. Who theoretically is still alive.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, because the time- the time got reset. She wakes up. Shit again.

Here we go again. Ooh, Karis is close to leveling up, though. And I think that you could do- I think you could either bring along Doran- Doran Boots.

I got level three. Yeah, you can bring along a level three.

[Referee (James)]
I think you could both bring along a level four. I think that's fine. I think that has to be fine.

[Frogitha]
All right, Kibi will look out for- Kibi will look out for, um, old whatever her name is. Yeah, whatever her name is.

[Referee (James)]
You guys have to keep the higher levels from attacking Sorcerer.

[Speaker 4]
And the Sorcerer has to take care of the lower levels.

[Verr]
How much room Director will be in? Like, will we be in, like, a large room?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, go ahead and pop yourselves on the map there. So, these two guys, pretty happy with how things are going on. Look, Kibi, you'll recognize them.

They do not have memory of the previous cycle's events just yet.

[Frogitha]
She greets them as she's known them all along.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, hey. Hey, big lady. It's the- Listen, we've been having a great time at school.

We're normally pretty bad at it. But for some reason, we just feel like we take these tests. We go on vendors.

We're hungover the next day. And it's like we know all the answers. Like, we've seen them before.

It's crazy. So, we're on a winning streak. We figure we're going to do a little bit of extracurriculars.

We're going to get some extra credit.

[Speaker 4]
See if we could just, like, finish out the semester early. Then do whatever we want. So, what we'd like to do is we've got these bombs.

We think they're bombs. We're going to try to make a bomb. That if they kill these critters, and then Jimmy interrupts and says, or if they die around them, he's like, no, no.

[Referee (James)]
It's going to be when they- The bombs have to kill them for this day. He's like, no, no. If they die around them, it's going to happen.

They start arguing about it. Anyway, something will happen when elementals die nearby them. And then they go into these things.

And I think it's going to be when they're killed near our little crystal balls here. And Jimmy over here thinks it's when they die.

[Frogitha]
This feels like that mission in Skyrim where you're given scrolls to use and they backfire every time you use them on purpose.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, kind of like that. Kind of like that. Because what we need is bait.

And that's why we put an ad up for a sorcerer. We need somebody who's kind of like between the three of us.

[Speaker 4]
Who's going to be, you know, plenty of easy meals.

[Frogitha]
Well, Gibby can tank things. And Goblin here. Explosions are, you know, like fire.

So they make fire. Goblin's in.

[Referee (James)]
Exactly. So you're going to be perfect bait. We're perfect bait.

[Speaker 4]
And then we have some people who can actually hold their own. Who can keep us from dying. Yep.

Well, you distract them. That's the hope. A ranger.

Now, we did get a loan. We did get a loan for some of our studies.

[Referee (James)]
Of course, this is the whole idea here is that if we get extra credit for this, this all pays off. Then that loan, we don't have to like spend it on room and board because we're going to finish the semester out early for academic excellence.

[Speaker 4]
So we're just going to have that money.

[Referee (James)]
It's more of a grant than a loan, you know. It's like a generosity thing. It's like, oh, well, you should pay it forward and eventually pay it back.

But it's more of a grant. Like, all right, well, reinvest into the school. Once you're like, I'll make money as a wizard or whatever.

[Speaker 4]
But that's a problem for a future us. At the very least, next semester, we could live like kings. So if this goes well, we'll give each of you an extra 30 gold.

And then we can actually make a few extras for you, if you like. We get to keep a bomb? Yeah, I mean, we could make it for you.

The biggest thing that we're like in trouble that we lack for is ingredients. Look at all the elementals here. Oh, yeah, there we go.

All right, so any questions for you guys? Uh, what kind of elementals? Where?

That's a great question. I think it starts with a seed.

[Referee (James)]
That's kind of why we came to this place. Nice little content, little tossing of elemental power.

[Speaker 4]
Actually, sorry. Being in an open area, I'm going to get kaiju. It's a big dinosaur.

There's going to be a bunch of them. You know, let's go for a swarm. Let's just like shake all of them together.

Arthur's saying this, and Jimmy says, what?

[Referee (James)]
That's a stupid idea. Give me that. And they find over this bag and out come a bunch of beans that spill onto the ground.

[Speaker 4]
Bees? Beans. Oh, okay.

The bees are next. Oh, oh, God. I'm going to have you folks get into initiative.

[Referee (James)]
He's not getting placed right there just this moment. I'm going to let you guys place yourselves around in a moment.

[Speaker 4]
If it's warm.

[Frogitha]
Oh, God. I have a plus two to initiative.

[Verr]
Do I see what kind of methods they are? Okay. A variety?

[Speaker 4]
Any particular like main group? No. However strange you find that, I guarantee you, I was more surprised.

That's weird. They don't even have like a... It seems like they don't even have an official stat block for it.

No, no, they do have an official stat block. They don't have official art for it. Or, well, Nephthys doesn't have one.

That is extra weird. What the hell, man?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know how I got so high.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so he's going to start that far away. I'll let you guys position yourselves anywhere within one movement.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Verr]
Sorry, I can't see where they are.

[Frogitha]
I don't want to go anywhere. I will take my chances.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Each round, 1d4 methods are going to split off of the first of a swarm. It can be many.

There can be multiple. And they're going to move for the... And they're going to move for Archon's Goblin rather than the other people.

So they will be weak.

[Frogitha]
We have to use these bombs, right? Or our companions are going to be using them.

[Referee (James)]
They're going to test out whether or not they are... Whether or not dying nearby for them.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. Perfect.

[Referee (James)]
I felt like I had an apprentice stat block. I guess not. But I can literally just look up Nephthys nearby.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Frogitha]
I love my character art.

[Referee (James)]
We should... Oh, see, that's where you should play them all.

[Frogitha]
They look like they're, like, cracked out or something.

[Referee (James)]
They are. The crack elemental.

[Frogitha]
Oh my god.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. Dude, this guy's got... Oh, you look old like shit.

That's for you. Well, you get an encounter with... No, no, no.

Bring back my dwarf music. What are you doing?

[Verr]
What are you doing? Dinky dinky hole. Yes.

[Referee (James)]
Arsene's gobbling. You are, though.

[Frogitha]
Where are these oceans at?

[Referee (James)]
They're about, like, uh, 20 feet up, I would say.

[Frogitha]
Awesome, awesome.

[Referee (James)]
About 30 feet up, I'd say. Those.

[Frogitha]
Where did all my cantrips go? What the fuck? Yeah, I'll fix that.

That's not good. Um... So weird.

They all disappeared. Uh, well, I guess I will just, um... Is that...

Yeah. Is that a distant one? Yeah, 30 feet.

Critical hit! Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
Oh god.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Got enough for the bank?

[Frogitha]
How do I... I've been rolling really good. I don't know what you did to this game, but it works.

How do I critical that? There's not really a...

[Referee (James)]
Good question. So when you click roll damage, what I'll do is I'll double it. Hit that.

I hit double. And we take a little chunk out of them.

[Frogitha]
Oh, uh, that will be my... Oh, goddammit. Now Kiwi's gone.

Okay. You have another...

[Referee (James)]
Did your character move?

[Frogitha]
No, I didn't want to. There's no reason to.

[Referee (James)]
No, that's fine. You have another action. I think it's like a two-action one, right?

[Frogitha]
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know what else I would do.

[Verr]
Fucking taunt them. Yell at them.

[Frogitha]
Oh, actually, I could just shoot them with a stun gun.

[Verr]
It also works. Elementally profile them.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god.

[Frogitha]
Elementally profile them. Okay, well... That missed.

That's my go. All right, Kiwi... Uh...

Kiwi, smash.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Frogitha]
I need to rage first. I can do that as a free action. Fuck it, I'm hero pointing it.

I missed it again. Beautiful. Uh, and then my second action will be to hit them.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, do it.

[Frogitha]
God. All right, Kiwi.

[Referee (James)]
Jeez. Fuji! Oh, by the way, all of you, um...

Set your hero points to three.

[Frogitha]
Oh, perfect, okay. You technically started many hours ago.

[Verr]
I'm gonna cask. Oh, shit.

[Referee (James)]
Do you think those... Oh, dude, dude, dude.

[Frogitha]
Oh, it didn't take my cantrips. I'm so confused here.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, I agree.

[Frogitha]
I've got primal innate spells, and then also primal spontaneous spells. I'm so confused.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, I'm having a very bad time.

[Frogitha]
Oh.

[Verr]
I'm just gonna run up here. And Kaiju's gonna do my little num-num. Ah.

As he tries to bite an icy one and gets a toothache. He's just gonna line up his shot. And he's gonna go pew.

Oh, why did I undo that one? You need to go pew for 14 damage. Dead.

Very efficient. Is there anything else nearby?

[Referee (James)]
These two are, uh, looking at their... looking at their scrolls and stuff. They're like, oh, oh, uh, we weren't ready yet.

Um, we have more seats though. That's, that's fine. We got plenty of it.

[Verr]
Okay, and is there anything else to shoot? No, we're gonna make them. Just saying.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Verr]
Then he's gonna reload, and I guess that's it.

[Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm.

[Referee (James)]
Brute apprentice. Definitely supposed to have the... Yeah, we're gonna put all the syrup ready on there.

Oh, why did I do the syrup? They're gonna bring out another bag of beans. All right, this one's gonna be...

Two. We're gonna put two bags here. We're gonna try to, like, stay between them.

Go ahead and add... Yeah, go ahead and add yourselves to initiative. It should be up there now.

No, no, I didn't. These guys keep losing. Oh, there's, like, there's, like, random walls in the air.

I didn't even notice because of GM view. Hey, this time I get to do it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no.

[Referee (James)]
Mephits one, two. Remember, at the beginning of each round, these guys are gonna spawn a bunch of Mephits, Revan.

[Frogitha]
Well, that makes more sense. XP for us.

[Verr]
So you're saying we should just let it sit and cook so we can just farm it for experience?

[Referee (James)]
That seems like the objectively correct method.

[Verr]
Because each encounter, as well, the more enemies involved means more experience ratio.

[Referee (James)]
Now there's, like, a little target template thing, where if you put down the template, it auto targets, and that gets rid of that fucking goad.

[Verr]
Evie and Gaiju.

[Frogitha]
What? Oh, no.

[Verr]
Why would you be so mean?

[Frogitha]
Eat it.

[Verr]
Ah, bummer.

[Frogitha]
How much do we take? Half?

[Referee (James)]
So I clicked half, which looks like it automatically applied your resistance, and Gaiju's resistance. That is their turn. Gaiju.

[Verr]
Gaiju's turn. It's gonna go. Probably shouldn't do this before.

It's gonna move up. And it's gonna target. You said there was two groups, or this is just the second group?

[Referee (James)]
No, there's two groups.

[Verr]
Okay, it's gonna bite that one. It's gonna go, nom. Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

It's gonna jump away. Like, you just hear the growling crunch of the beer. The stone and ice crunch between his teeth.

And he didn't move, so he gets a second attack, actually. Missing.

[Speaker 5]
Cutie.

[Verr]
I think he has anything but one action. Um, I was gonna try demoralize. Uh, I can't demoralize.

[Referee (James)]
No, that's rough. Oh, there's the roll. Oh, yeah, there's a little bit.

A little low.

[Verr]
I think that's my turn. Tries to elementally prove all these creatures. Yeah, it's rough, buddy.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, here we go. Fly speed of 25.

[Verr]
We're just gonna do a, uh, shot. It's gonna go, kabow, with his gun. Damn it, it's a hit.

[Referee (James)]
I go before you do. Uh, you do? I do.

Sorry, okay.

[Verr]
I don't even know why I did that. I'm not upset with you. I don't know why Foundry, uh, didn't mention.

It didn't show the initiative for me, for some reason. Yeah, because got Memphis Worms 2, it was up first. Uh, there we go.

[Referee (James)]
That is...

[Frogitha]
Where'd James go?

[Verr]
Um, let's go.

[Referee (James)]
We got a delivery of food. We have, uh, raw salmon that could be cooked, so I'm gonna eat it. Pretty good.

[Speaker 4]
Sushi?

[Frogitha]
Oh, I love sushi. I could totally go for some fucking sushi right now. Fuck.

[Speaker 5]
Very good.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, let me take this before I check them. Before I check whether they got the order right. Let me just take this turn.

Pretty simple. It's gonna be the same thing. Okay, Deku.

I'll just do... There we go. Reflex saves.

I mean, Kaiju and Kibi. Kibi saves.

[Frogitha]
Uh, I'm fine.

[Speaker 5]
Kaiju!

[Referee (James)]
Oh no, Kibi also takes full. Now I gotta do that. All right, Ranger.

[Verr]
All right, now it's my turn. Can I just use the, uh, same attack rolls before? Because it uses resources and I'd have to, like...

Yeah, that's totally fine. Reset my resources somehow.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, roll damage.

[Frogitha]
That Mephit Swarm above Kibi does not have good placement.

[Verr]
And so, 10 damage. Wow, I rolled really, really low on that one. I'm gonna do a thoughtful reload.

So I'll do a reload and a recall knowledge. Can I get some insightful information? Nope.

You get some information that's not very insightful. Uh, that should be 24, sorry. I did not roll map.

Does the 24 still hit?

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah.

[Verr]
Perfect. 14 damage.

[Referee (James)]
You're thinking, like, they're made of elemental- They're made of elements. What I should do is, I should hit them with just physical stuff. That'll, like, overload the element.

[Verr]
I just need to overpower resistances.

[Referee (James)]
When you shoot them, it doesn't do as good.

[Verr]
Kibi!

[Frogitha]
The swarms themselves. Are they on here?

[Referee (James)]
I'm here. Okay, this is one to the right.

[Frogitha]
Okay, Kibi. Smash.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
Don't forget your...

[Speaker 5]
Huh?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, did you roll damage both times? Oh, you did. It just took a while for it to get to me.

Not looking happy.

[Frogitha]
You know, we're Gucci. Wait, where we are? Um...

Oh shit, did I target it? Yeah, I did. Okay.

Reload my spoon gun.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
Damn it. Uh, this guy... He started off with a little bit of fast healing.

A little bit of heals. Carter's turn. Now, I was unable to use my breath weapon again for...

A couple of rounds. Nope, that's not damage to people. That's two rounds.

Also don't know why that's... Oh, I guess I know why that's here. I'm sorry.

I'm moving to your space. Do Swarming Claws. Go ahead and make me some basic reflex.

Oh, that's for Kibi and Kaju again.

[Frogitha]
Why did it not... I rolled. I hit the roll and it just didn't...

I succeeded regardless.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
It just didn't pop up. I got 24.

[Referee (James)]
You have to click on Kibi first, probably.

[Frogitha]
Ah, that makes sense. Okay. Keep that in mind.

[Referee (James)]
Then repeat the damage. Oh, hold on. Full damage.

That's supposed to take full damage. You're supposed to take... There you go.

Yeah, that's complete. I'll have him... I'll have him use his last action on summoning a bunch of methods.

That's not... That's not damage. Think of that.

Three methods. We're gonna have a dust method, an earth method, and a... Is that an ice method?

Yeah. Air, dust, and earth. Pretty cool.

That brings us to Koochie.

[Verr]
Koochie's turn! Okay, he's gonna go... Oh, actually, no.

He doesn't need a move. Sorry. He's gonna go Nonst.

Eee! He goes nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. And crunches that little method.

Does it die? Yeah. And it's gonna go up here in Prismal.

Koochie is going to look at these ones. And he's gonna do his electric arc. Wait, did I just target...

[Referee (James)]
No! That's one of the impractices.

[Verr]
I want to target the... Other one. Not him!

Might as well just do the, uh, the DC save. Hey! Perfect.

And then it's my turn. Okay, so you guys, this is that.

[Referee (James)]
We have a method swarm. Impostor. Oh, I don't want to get the buddy.

So we're gonna go for you. I'm also gonna see... That's not damage.

Oh! I can't use a breath weapon again for one round. That'd be at least one round.

Immediately, then that would be zero rounds. So that can't be the case. Go ahead and make me a...

Go ahead and make me a reflex save, Koochie. We hit you for some damage. And I'm gonna spin off another D4.

Ah!

[Speaker 5]
Merely two.

[Referee (James)]
Another dust method and an ice method. That's his turn. Bring us the ranger.

[Frogitha]
A ranger.

[Verr]
Gonna do a little pew pew. 23. For a 14 damage.

Very good. Gonna do a thoughtful reload. I don't think that...

Matters anything. Nothing. And then I'm gonna do a...

Finish the job and shoot it again. But this time, I'm going to change my shot. Double damage.

And that should be my turn. But I didn't do... Matt, would 20 still hit?

Sorry.

[Referee (James)]
Uh... Yeah, 20 would still hit.

[Speaker 5]
Bad. My turn.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, he's not touching ice. There's no reload. A regular roof method.

Which is... What's the speed? Fly 15.

Ah, that's bullshit. All right, so I'm gonna fly... I'm gonna fly up.

And over. There you go. You go back there.

You can spend two actions flying and one action hacking Arsonist Goblin. With a hit that was almost critical. That would have been funny.

But no cigar. We hit Arsonist Goblin. Do a little damage.

That's the end of this turn. So we come down to Kiwi.

[Frogitha]
Okay. Well... Uh...

I'm gonna just roll the strikes first. And then see how many hit. And then we'll damage.

Okay. One hits.

[Verr]
Did they like add that second bag? That's a bad idea. I feel the Apprentice is that.

[Frogitha]
Arsonist Goblin. Oh no. You know what?

You're getting touched. Please hit. Hell yeah, it hits.

What is Sorcerer's Potency?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Frogitha]
Wait. Does that...

[Referee (James)]
When you cast a spell from your spell slots, it either deals damage or stores hit points. You gain a status bonus that spells damage or healing equal to the spell's rank.

[Frogitha]
Do I enable that or keep that disabled?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, go ahead and enable that. Like there's a little toggle. I didn't get the...

[Frogitha]
Oh, well let me.

[Referee (James)]
Really? I'm clicking it.

[Frogitha]
I see, I see. Let me... All right, roll damage.

It still is not letting me. So I guess just add a plus one.

[Referee (James)]
This is a spell's rank. Are cantrips like rank zero or are they...

[Verr]
It's a spell slot so it doesn't add to cantrips.

[Frogitha]
Okay, that makes sense then. And then I will... Can I shoot him with my spoon gun from this distance?

[Referee (James)]
You do want to be careful because the spoon gun I think does extra... Does damage in like a five foot area or something like that. Does it?

It should have like a scatter, doesn't it? It has scatter.

[Frogitha]
It has scatter. Okay, thank you for letting me know that. I would have killed all of us.

[Verr]
It's only one damage. Fine.

[Frogitha]
Oh.

[Verr]
But it'd be super effective against wolves.

[Frogitha]
Okay. All right, well that... I guess I could like...

All right, let's see what you know. Where is it, where is it? Recall knowledge.

I'm gonna look through here. What do I know about these unnamed things?

[Referee (James)]
About as much... About as much as your ranger friend. Which sadly didn't say that much.

[Verr]
I didn't know anything good about my later check.

[Referee (James)]
Your later check... Your first check was a... Your first check was a natural one.

Your second check was a natural three.

[Verr]
There was not much improvement to be had, unfortunately. Don't know anything about a group of them, don't know about one of them.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, see I can't even... I can move if I want to hit you with the... Yeah, if I want to hit you with the kill and I just gotta...

Slide over this way, that's fine.

[Frogitha]
Oh. Well, he's gonna hit his own guy, isn't he?

[Referee (James)]
No.

[Frogitha]
What?

[Referee (James)]
I can angle it. Angle it away. There's nobody over here, so I can just...

[Speaker 5]
Ah, there it is.

[Referee (James)]
Make me a save. Poochie an arsonist goblin. Poochie makes it.

Let's go Kneebog. Kneebog! Oh, just say it's like a...

It's like a message, probably. Yeah, look for... Hey, there you go.

History damage. And that is the end of that particular turn. Damn, if it's warm.

Well, this went fine last time. So, we're gonna... We're just gonna do it three times, because you both are still standing here.

For the first one. It's gonna be Kaiju and Kibi for all three of these.

[Frogitha]
Uh, Kibi, Kibi, Kibi. Oh, we click on Kibi.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you don't have to click on Kibi for this one, I don't think. Because I'm targeting. So, if you press that button, then it's just gonna roll for her, I think.

All right, too fast. All right, number two.

[Frogitha]
Jesus, okay. Are you trying to send a message to someone? Hold on.

[Referee (James)]
Well, it only takes me one action to do Swarming Claws, and you're both here. Kaiju, come on. I know you took that throat.

Number three. Ah, that's my bad. Probably just taking a while to get to me.

[Verr]
Ah, oh, let's see a crit fail.

[Referee (James)]
What have we got, Kibi, for the last one?

[Frogitha]
Uh, oh god damn. Okay, let's see. I got a 15.

Jesus Christ.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so the first one, you both failed. The second one, Kaiju failed, but Kibi crit failed.

[Frogitha]
I crit failed? Oh no. Oh my god.

[Verr]
That was like a high one, too. Like, every other one combined.

[Referee (James)]
Damn, why didn't you guys re-roll any of those?

[Frogitha]
Was it too late?

[Referee (James)]
I mean, you got a chance now, I guess.

[Frogitha]
What do you mean, I have a chance now?

[Referee (James)]
Do you guys want to re-roll any of those?

[Frogitha]
Fuck yeah, I do. Which one was that from? Which one did I crit fail?

I didn't even notice I crit failed.

[Referee (James)]
I crit failed the 16.

[Frogitha]
Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay, yeah. Re-roll.

Oh my god, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's significantly better.

[Frogitha]
Shit.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, undo. Uh, instead of 32 fucking damage, you instead take 8.

[Frogitha]
James, you are a gracious god.

[Referee (James)]
Remember this fucking era, boy. It'd really suck if I killed one of you guys in like a random side mission. That's how it has to happen.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, it's always the non-important ones that get you.

[Referee (James)]
Exactly.

[Frogitha]
It's never like the really big, important shit. It's always like, you know, the one on a random Saturday that was thrown together.

[Referee (James)]
Remember, anybody can be resurrected.

[Frogitha]
Indeed.

[Verr]
Unless our buddies are gone.

[Frogitha]
Unless you use a 6th level spell on level 1s.

[Referee (James)]
That's how the death happens. That's step one of the resurrection at this rate. All right, Kuji.

[Verr]
Gonna cast rank 2 heal animal.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, sweet boy.

[Verr]
And then, uh, the pain's still alive, so Kuji's gonna stand- Kaiju's gonna stand up and he's gonna take revenge. He's gonna go, That's funny, he's aiming at the guy below him. Yeah, it matches too well with the colors.

Everything's too colorful, I can't see. That's, that's true.

[Speaker 5]
Did do that.

[Referee (James)]
Hey, I should have spent an action on the Mephit's War. I'll remember that for this guy. I'd love to do is get Kaiju and Kuji in the same, like, four, uh, 2x2 block.

All right, so Kuji, you're gonna have to make two- Wait, no, no. Can I do- Can I do Breath of Weapon? Which is gonna be more effective here.

They're not thinking about effective, they're thinking about beating people up. Kuji, go ahead and make me two saves.

[Verr]
Oh. Oh, I'm gonna- Prepare both of those. Gonna hair point.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, buddy.

[Verr]
Oh, and, uh, that, that's all of Kuji's hair points.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's not good. No, it's not. All right, the first one was a regular fail, so that's 12 damage.

The second one was a crit fail, so that's 30 damage. He spends his last action, get some mephits.

[Verr]
Get some mephits up.

[Frogitha]
Where's my sorcerer? Do I have any healing?

[Verr]
How quick do these mephits look?

[Frogitha]
Oh my god, I have heal! I didn't know that. I've been looking at it.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't register. Ignore that, that's not damage. He summons a single mephit.

Also, I have a thing now that automatically places people before- I think, actually, Kuji was already there. That doesn't- So you would not have noticed that it was working. However, now setting that if you go down, it automatically places you above the current combatant in the initiative.

[Speaker 5]
Nice.

[Referee (James)]
We shall have a water mephit.

[Verr]
Ranger? Can I do a shot at Kuji? Oh no, that's a swarm.

Um. Oh, hold on, I don't know if I did that right.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Verr]
So Kuji's here for two. There we go. And then, I don't know what I'm going to do.

Hello. Reload with elemental. Now it's my turn.

[Referee (James)]
Present with mephit. He's banged up, so you don't know what you're doing.

[Verr]
I collected a little help.

[Referee (James)]
He's gonna go underground with a good, fast healer. We have a water mephit. We're gonna move, and you know what, it's just gotta be a mephit.

All right, you two go ahead and make me some basic reflex.

[Frogitha]
Oh, thank god.

[Referee (James)]
Kuji, no.

[Frogitha]
Oh my god, I have seven hit points. Yeah, we're doing heal after this.

[Referee (James)]
You got less than seven hit points now.

[Frogitha]
Wait, I'm supposed to take half of that, aren't I? Because I passed it. Oh, you're right.

[Referee (James)]
That's my bad. Um, there you go.

[Speaker 5]
Wait.

[Frogitha]
Spells can I cast in one go, in one time? Because I can do two.

[Speaker 5]
That's what you get actions for.

[Frogitha]
Okay, awesome. I didn't know if there was like a weird, like you can only do one.

[Referee (James)]
Nah, this is a better one.

[Frogitha]
Fuck D&D. Like Pathfinder is so much better. Now I know what Otter was talking about.

Like, you know, complaining about for like a year.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, no, I felt it. I was like, that was just, you know, we're just doing the same thing.

[Verr]
There's a way to get like a quickened one for sustaining spells. And then you can get another one where you can sustain a spell as part of a summoning action. And then so essentially you can get three summons up at the same time.

And so you just spend your three turns to sustain spells. And you have your three summons up each getting their two turns. That is great.

That's so cool.

[Speaker 5]
I love it.

[Referee (James)]
All right. It is... Oh, it's...

I'm a dumbass. Arsonist Goblin, I'm sorry.

[Frogitha]
Okay, I heal, I'm gonna heal, uh... Okay. All these bitches are healthy.

I'm... can I... If I do...

If I do the big one, the big heal... Oh my god, this is so... Do I need to place the 30 foot thingy?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, because there's a... This big guy here, the Method Swarm... He's just chill by him.

[Frogitha]
I don't care if it heals them too. I don't care.

[Referee (James)]
Um, I want...

[Frogitha]
This is not healthy.

[Referee (James)]
It's what it, um...

[Frogitha]
Okay. Uh, well then you know what? Maybe I will just...

[Referee (James)]
There's... I'm not even saying anything. You can...

you do what you want here. You have like, uh, damaged teammates.

[Frogitha]
I'm sitting right by him. Hold on. You're not like, untagging or anything, right?

No. Try that again, and do a regular heal. We're not burning anything.

So why would I put burning on? Burn it? I have?

[Referee (James)]
This is for potency.

[Frogitha]
Okay. And then I will also heal myself. By casting it again.

[Verr]
But you know, there's a third level heal you can do, like a 30 foot elimination.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, but doesn't that heal things like enemies?

[Verr]
Yeah.

[Frogitha]
All right. Um... I think we're good on that front.

Uh, and then I will... Move. There we go.

That's my turn.

[Verr]
Because, did you... I was gonna say, if you do a two action, you can do an extra, like, increased healing amount.

[Frogitha]
I think I'm gonna move out of the fucking way.

[Verr]
That is a good point. Uh, I think that's... Koochie's gonna be dead now.

[Speaker 5]
No. Well, I mean...

[Verr]
You're not going...

[Referee (James)]
You were told explicitly, like, who's going for who at the beginning of the round.

[Verr]
Did you not listen? Yeah. I didn't say they're going for Koochie, did they?

[Frogitha]
For me.

[Referee (James)]
They're going... So the little guys are going for the little guy. Big guys are going for the big guys.

You turn to your gaze on the little guys to get a little extra... A little extra hits in, and then you're paying for it.

[Verr]
Oh. Are we trying to kill the big guys?

[Referee (James)]
I missed. That was supposed to be against... Arson-ish.

Arson-ish Goblin. That's why I didn't notice the spelling was different.

[Frogitha]
Goddammit, I twinged that.

[Referee (James)]
What's your... Evidently, what's your AC?

[Frogitha]
AC? 15.

[Referee (James)]
What's your... Sorry, your A-she.

[Frogitha]
A-she is 15.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, that misses that. He's still 14. Oh, that's the end of his turn.

And 15 foot fly speed, so it's two moving...

[Speaker 5]
Gibby!

[Referee (James)]
That definitely hits.

[Frogitha]
I'm going to work here. Okay. And then I'm going to move.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's... You get an additional two damage from the axe. The Retribution Axe.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
He's the last one who hit you, so that means you get to whack him again.

[Frogitha]
I'm going down here.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Frogitha]
Do not want my comrade to die. I also don't want Arsonist Goblin too, but Kuji is near death, so...

[Referee (James)]
That's fair. Who are you trying to smack here?

[Frogitha]
The guy that I have.

[Referee (James)]
The guy? Very good. The image is not doing so hot.

Are you moved? Are you swung? Is that the end of your turn?

[Frogitha]
End of my turn.

[Referee (James)]
Very good, very good. Oh, I hit two people for free now. It's back to the big dog.

I'm not doing that. Hold on.

[Speaker 5]
No, no.

[Referee (James)]
Dead one out of the way. Alright, there we go. Everything's back out.

Everything's back to how it should be. Kuji! Sorry, Kaiju.

That's one success. One failure. Two successes.

Guess the fail then. Not trash. Half damage, half...

Wait! Nope. Crash that last one.

Nine need to make. I reversed it. We're good.

[Frogitha]
Sorry, I'm sorry. I looked at him. He's mad at me now.

[Referee (James)]
Dog's very upset that you observed.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
They're gonna keep spawning.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, we gotta get rid of these big dudes. Get overwhelmed.

[Referee (James)]
Here's what I can do. Nine. Here we come.

Breathwork in time.

[Frogitha]
Nine. How many hit points do I have? How many hero points does Ki be used?

I think one, so I would have...

[Referee (James)]
You've only used one so far.

[Frogitha]
Alright, yeah. I'm gonna re-roll that one. For fuck's sake.

[Referee (James)]
Ah, that's rough.

[Frogitha]
Last one will be for emergencies. Damn it. Alright.

[Referee (James)]
Kuji had it dying twice.

[Verr]
Uh, Kuji's dead. Dead, dead. Dead?

Dead, dead? Dead, dead. Yep.

[Referee (James)]
If he had it dying twice, he should be dying three.

[Verr]
No, no, I'm dying dead four. I like Kuji's dead, dead.

[Referee (James)]
No, you should be dying three.

[Verr]
No, he's been up and down three times already.

[Frogitha]
Is he?

[Verr]
Don't you start at dying, uh...

[Referee (James)]
He started dying four. Hold on. Alright, well, time to go.

Re-claim with the death roll. Why did we have something wrong?

[Verr]
He was wounded eight. So he's dying once he's dead.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, let me pull...

[Referee (James)]
How do I risk death? If you have the wounded condition, increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value. So if you're wounded three, does that mean that you become...

dying three?

[Verr]
No, you increase it by your wounded... If you go down, you get the dying condition, and you increase it by your wounded condition. Ah, shit.

[Referee (James)]
Gotta spend money to resurrect you.

[Frogitha]
We'll get it. Kibi is not letting anyone die fully. With her seven gold.

[Verr]
Are you kidding me?

[Frogitha]
Not? How much gold do you have, Guji? Can I get it off of you?

[Verr]
No gold.

[Frogitha]
Oh, no. Goblin?

[Speaker 5]
Ranger.

[Frogitha]
Goblin has 29 gold.

[Verr]
Ranger... Which one's more legit? The breath of that thing.

The one, um, although, Kaiju still gets his turn. He is an adult animal, and so... He has one action to do whatever, which he's gonna miss.

And then... That's mine. I do my reload, and then I do another shot.

[Referee (James)]
Hey, there we go.

[Speaker 5]
Hit.

[Verr]
For, uh, 12 damage. I can't hit right.

[Referee (James)]
I'm gonna reverse that.

[Verr]
Um, it does count as splash. So I'm not sure if that, uh, acid damage carries over to anything.

[Referee (James)]
How does it count as splash?

[Verr]
Um, splash upon acid.

[Referee (James)]
There we go. I'm just trying to figure out why it does. Is acid, uh, physical damage?

[Verr]
Uh, acid is acid damage.

[Referee (James)]
That's what I'm thinking. So why is it...

[Verr]
It might be resistant because it's a mephite. Normally, earth has a resistant element, uh, acid.

[Referee (James)]
Immune to precision. That's, that's what was taken off. But it does take acid damage.

Why is it not adding? And how many times have you hit this thing?

[Verr]
Uh, three times? Okay. No, shoot, twice.

Twice.

[Speaker 5]
All right.

[Verr]
And that is my turn.

[Referee (James)]
It is not looking great. Earth mephite is...

[Speaker 5]
Let's roll for it.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, he's willing to pop out.

[Frogitha]
What were you rolling for?

[Referee (James)]
I was rolling for his morale. Let's see if he was, like, gonna go for it. He's gonna fly over.

And Mr. Poop. Fly that healing. Yes.

A water path. Uh, Kiba, do you have reactive strike?

[Frogitha]
Um, let me look. I don't think I have reactive strike. No.

I do have... Uh... I don't know if this counts as anything.

But, you know. I don't exactly know how that works.

[Referee (James)]
When other people attempt to move, you can try to... Oh, that's funny. When other people try to move, you could roll acrobatics against them.

And if you're worse, it knocks them off guard.

[Frogitha]
So could I have done that to this guy?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. His other one's about to do it as well. This one right next to you.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Verr]
That's an action, not a reaction.

[Frogitha]
Is it? Because there's no real way to...

[Verr]
Yeah, next to it.

[Frogitha]
Ah, it's not a reaction, I don't think. But I don't know how you would do it if it's not a reaction.

[Referee (James)]
It says when other creatures attempt to move.

[Verr]
Yeah, so if you do it next to yourself and then try to run away from your next turn.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so on your turn... Right, so on your turn, you can just attempt that. I mean, that's the same thing with the steal action.

Trying to frighten people, intimidate them.

[Frogitha]
I will probably never use that because I still don't understand it.

[Referee (James)]
It's just, so your last... You know how your multi-attack melody, like your last attack really sucks. Because you only have like a plus one bonus to actually hit on that attack.

Instead of doing that, what you do is you'd be like, That guy's right in front of me. Actually, you could do this at the start of your turn. You'd be like, ah, you're like tripping him up.

You're breaking his ankles. If you succeed, you could literally knock him off guard. And that means your remaining two attacks, even if nobody else is around you.

You're gonna get the benefit of that flanking.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
So you're more likely, even if those first two attacks are gonna hit anyways. You're more likely to crit as a result.

[Frogitha]
Well, that's awesome. Because I also have something else that fucks with that.

[Verr]
Yeah. Think about like when someone tries to walk in, like you step in front of them. And you're like, whoop.

And then you both sidestep at the same time. Then you both sidesteps like, whoop. And it throws him off guard.

And then I let you like, especially if you're a rogue, get your second attack. Things like that.

[Frogitha]
Alrighty.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. I'm a big fan. I didn't mean to bother you now.

Oh, like you're doing right now? I said, huh? And then he just kept saying, huh?

Huh? Huh? And he kept getting in my face and then he walked away.

[Speaker 5]
Huh?

[Referee (James)]
Like that. Arsonist Goblin. I can't really use the breath weapon here.

No, yes, I can.

[Frogitha]
Oh, you absolutely can. You're just gonna hit your buddies too. And that's beautiful.

I love that. I support that.

[Referee (James)]
Up until this point, they've been studiously avoiding hitting Arthur.

[Speaker 5]
Uh-oh.

[Referee (James)]
I was gonna hit one of them no matter what. No, that's, that's, that one's dead.

[Frogitha]
Oh, nine.

[Speaker 5]
There we go. Arthur, no.

[Frogitha]
Please bring one back.

[Referee (James)]
Goblin takes regular damage. The ice method. He's not touching ice just now.

[Frogitha]
I think I might suicide bomb. What? Very on brand for her or him.

I don't actually know what gender I made them. I don't, oh, unknown. Okay, cool.

That makes sense.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, Virhehe, I'm gonna put you in charge of Arthur. He's been attacked now. Just a little apprentice dude.

[Frogitha]
Forget about making another, another character.

[Referee (James)]
You might have an opportunity soon. All right, Arston's Goblin.

[Frogitha]
Oh no, I didn't say it like that. Actually, you know what? I'm not taking, I'm not taking a step back.

Um, and I'm gonna pull out my flamethrower. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Well, let's see.

[Frogitha]
You're the, uh. Child. Oh, it's a 30-foot line.

Drop, because that's free action. Um. They're all concentrated on me, so...

I'm gonna do what a idiot would do. Uh, how, I, I don't know how to do that.

[Referee (James)]
I am unable to- Oh, so if you click on the, uh, if you click on the card in the chat, it's gonna like, expand. Now what kind of mountain is fire, did you buy off that other guy?

[Frogitha]
Oh, Lesser. Okay. I'm assuming I don't have- I'm assuming this is gonna be two actions to activate it and then I- and draw it, so I can't really move and do this at the same time, so I'm- I guess I'll just die.

[Referee (James)]
That still gives you a bunch of targets, so there's this one, your death, and they take extra damage from the area damage.

[Frogitha]
Oh, I was gonna do all these. I was just gonna- I was just gonna concentrate it on me, like, turn it- You can only hit like, two of these guys anyways. Oh.

Alright then.

[Referee (James)]
I know what I'll do.

[Frogitha]
I know what I'll do. Uh... This is a mistake, but I'm gonna do it anyway.

Take a step back, we're gonna forget that I did any of that. Cone. Damage.

Yeah, which one's the water one, because like they don't have names on them.

[Referee (James)]
Water one, yeah, why don't they have names on them? I've been set to default to show everybody's names, but I think that doesn't apply to things like Raph and the Canadian.

[Frogitha]
Well, that's that's Goblin's turn. I have a feeling Goblin will not be with us for much longer.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, he's gotta kill these fucking swarms, man. That's one of them.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
That's my pick. I think they're gonna try to take you back home with them.

[Frogitha]
Back home? They're gonna steal me? Breathe weapon.

[Referee (James)]
Arthur and Arsenal's Goblin. I'm gonna need you to make me reflect save.

[Frogitha]
I'm not even gonna.

[Verr]
Do it.

[Frogitha]
I'm gonna crit.

[Verr]
You can't take damage if you don't roll.

[Frogitha]
No matter what damage I take, I'm down.

[Referee (James)]
Let's just aim. Oh, yeah, that's his turn. I have an ooze method.

And three actions, five over. That is their turn. Coming out to Kibi.

Kibi, there are two method swarms left. One of which is at half health. Which has been at near death for like two weeks.

[Frogitha]
Oh, which one's near death? This one up here.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, the one on the top is near death.

[Frogitha]
Damage?

[Referee (James)]
That's all right, that's one.

[Frogitha]
Awesome.

[Referee (James)]
He's very close to death. You just gotta hit him again.

[Frogitha]
Oh, wait, he's close to death?

[Referee (James)]
This is near death.

[Frogitha]
Oh, I see. It didn't show for me. All right.

Okay, cool.

[Referee (James)]
You don't have any hero points left.

[Frogitha]
Not that I'm willing to spend.

[Referee (James)]
You got one hit point left. Do something.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, but I'm also near death. I'm also near death and probably gonna go down and won't be able to stabilize myself without a hero point.

[Referee (James)]
That is true. All right, this is gonna be versus... I'm gonna move this little guy out of here, completely out of the way.

Arthur and Kaiju. Two saves. Arthur crit failed the first one.

Why are you boosting him to dying four?

[Frogitha]
Arthur, you better bail the fuck out of this one.

[Verr]
He's dying. Four.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't even roll the second damage out.

[Verr]
He failed. He's wounded two, so he's on dying three. It fails, so it brings him to dying three.

And then, regardless, crit fail, so that's an extra fail, so he's four. It doesn't matter the damage, it's dead.

[Referee (James)]
So he's wounded... He was wounded two.

[Verr]
Wounded two. When he gets knocked down first damage, that's wounded three.

[Referee (James)]
First damage doesn't knock him down. I saw he had five. No, it doesn't.

I applied it. He had five hit points left.

[Verr]
No, he only had five hit points.

[Referee (James)]
No, I applied the damage. He got six... Unless it's...

[Verr]
He only had five hit points. Like, I healed him back up, and then he got hit. And he's basically, basically dead.

And if he took 12 damage, that would have knocked him down.

[Referee (James)]
He didn't take 12 damage. He took six. I clicked apply, and then I clicked on him.

I saw he had five hit points left. Now, it could just be desync again, because the server's acting up. The second damage, he did...

[Verr]
He did crit fail that. Well, if he got knocked down and crit fail, it's still two dying. So either way, he's dead.

[Referee (James)]
Right, is that for... Okay. Oh no, that's doomed.

Give me a second. Dying one, or the result of your critical failure. So it's...

[Verr]
The Pathfinder does both of those. He was wounded two, so either way, he's dead.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, that sucks. And oh, that takes half of the second one. Man, I clicked that button, and it was legitimately like, 10 seconds later, I see like...

Like, wounded three, wounded four, dying four. I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! It's just desynced on my end.

[Frogitha]
Oh no.

[Referee (James)]
Arthur.

[Verr]
Arthur. Can I clear that, so I can see what's actually on the board? So that one's dead.

So it's just this one? Um, no, they're both still alive. He's got a heart.

[Referee (James)]
They're both still alive? One is near death. The other one is half health.

[Verr]
Where's my cast? I can't heal, can I?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you can't heal for a second.

[Verr]
Gun for the three action, make sure to kill that one that's nearly dead.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, three hit points, he absolutely cannot survive.

[Verr]
Yep, that's Arthur's turn.

[Referee (James)]
He's toast. Time for me to roll some morale. Nope, they're going full send.

[Frogitha]
This is crazy. How do we even recover a TPK?

[Referee (James)]
You gotta, you gotta talk to Warlock, the witch, or a cleric. And then you get a quest.

[Frogitha]
Uh, I can't even select Hebe right now, what the fuck? I can't do it on the board.

[Speaker 5]
I can't select Hebe. He doesn't cock it, Arthur.

[Frogitha]
I can't select, I'm gonna reload. Who am I supposed to take care of that?

[Verr]
That's the thing.

[Frogitha]
Can we bring in an extra character?

[Verr]
Arthur? No, not right now.

[Referee (James)]
Well, that's what Arthur is. Arthur can kill him. That's the thing.

[Verr]
How can Arthur kill him? He's got no damage. He's got no items.

[Frogitha]
Because, uh, he's Arthur.

[Verr]
He's got a 2d8 damage for max damage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
And you can kill him.

[Referee (James)]
You got the sheet, man. Horse is super damaged. All right.

[Speaker 5]
Half and half.

[Referee (James)]
And that is the end of his turn.

[Verr]
Ranger. Ranger's gonna drink a potion. And then two actions to, uh, book it.

So he moves 150 feet away.

[Referee (James)]
All right, he hit. That's funny. He's going underground.

I'm gonna go on this side. I'm gonna add, uh, Jimmy to the initiative as well. What's, what's this trench?

He's not, he's not touching water right now. He doesn't get healed.

[Frogitha]
I walk away from my computer and then get a notification. What was that? A puppy.

[Speaker 5]
Go for it.

[Frogitha]
I'm feeding the dog. So if you hit me, uh, roll for me. I'm feeding the dog.

okay just in case i'm not back in time i will be using hero point to stabilize myself okay

[Referee (James)]
nope nope get back here i gotta turn off that i could figure out a way to turn off that uh automatic healing check mark it's his turn arsonist goblin needs to do what stabilize hero point stabilization arsonist goblin still has a hero point

[Frogitha]
goblin does have hero points okay two of them actually i don't know if it adds things for

[Referee (James)]
like a recovery check or something like that but all right we'll stabilize i'm back where are we now it's arsonist goblin's turn uh oh wait am i supposed to roll something uh it should have sent you to dying and stuff like that but if you're stabilizing them must be add unconscious for zero hit points there you go uh these two are just gonna spend all their actions trying to hoist you up

[Frogitha]
i'm gonna get kidnapped oh yeah oh that's amazing i'm just gonna make three rolls for each one

[Referee (James)]
whenever they get to three successes they're gonna start turning you away now there's one it's a crit all right that's fine it'll be v2 stages half of the round we have jimmy who wants to control jimmy i give them uh both of you ownership

[Frogitha]
uh i can't forget that okay uh where is big flying monster that is trying to kill it down here okay what do you have on you jimmy jimothy jimmy has spell

[Referee (James)]
oh bells i thought this one has but no they don't that's up

[Frogitha]
i just roll damage that's it there's no for force barrage yeah jesus christ did i do something wrong yes what did i do you done minus three instead of three votes i i didn't put that in i just hit it um how do i even fix that because i don't see a way to change it that's a great question

[Verr]
what is what is the base damage what before was one and then she rolled a two and i had a minus three so it turned into so it should be three damage times three bolts if she does three actions

[Frogitha]
which is what i wanted to do but uh all right well that's gonna be uh such are

[Referee (James)]
nine so just do slash roll what yeah slash r or slash roll nine three times that was just the ones no you said it was three bolts for three damage

[Frogitha]
okay all right that makes sense then all right cool i guess that would be his go oh kibi still alive how far can you run kibi 35 all right let's go paste my axe does it

[Referee (James)]
oh forget your extra two damage extra two damage i'll roll an extra just do like slash r

[Frogitha]
uh stuff like that too here you go um and i'm not gonna re-roll that extra one because

[Referee (James)]
again i wouldn't be able to stabilize if i'm dying target was last creature to damage you that's the if somebody was the last creature to damage you you put that uh toggle that interactions

[Frogitha]
right i just keep forgetting um okay that's kibis go

[Verr]
oh that's awful Arthur's gonna do his last fit um oh no kibi no um yeah beggar i guess this is as good as any place to die uh he's going to do his ambitious spell so he's going to do a flat check seeds oh hey bible so what does he roll for the crit do i need to do like another check to determine how successful i cast it

[Referee (James)]
no no so that was the um must first attempt a dc11 flat check so just if you were if you

[Verr]
were 10 over then you would have um what's a flat check how do you get a 10 over on a flat check

[Referee (James)]
would that just be a nat 20 i guess or maybe for being well help action wouldn't do that yeah no i i'm the wrong person to ask about that i have no idea

[Verr]
but i do know that you succeeded when you went that fireball um kind of want to kill this thing

[Referee (James)]
but also kind of you could get a few people in there i'm gonna get kiwi okay put the burst down wait let me uh put a 20 foot template down now measurement controls circle template great get to them or us i'll get at least one of those guys in there if it like goes over one square then up

[Verr]
well if i go up i get kiwi and if i try to get it square and then up

[Referee (James)]
nope as does all of that guy's score different a little bit here go back down a little bit

[Frogitha]
because i can get in this little corner right here this little corner will not affect me

[Verr]
up the circle so if you go over it won't ever go up there no it won't hit anyone else except for that one guy there's no really good use of this but i would do the i'm not sure how to do a save in this one now because

[Referee (James)]
so you can request rolls i said this that you could request rolls just a little like a token hop bar in there why is tig in the pig is not in the party oh let's drag him out what's what's going on here uh reflex save right

[Verr]
yep that's a success

[Referee (James)]
actually takes half

[Verr]
this dc is 21 area but it's also an aoe would he yeah there's an extra five bringing him to negative four how do you how do you want to do it oh yeah just get a wisp of the uh the fire probably go like more like that because why not

[Referee (James)]
cheering if they could you take a bit of uh discorporating method leg fireball

[Frogitha]
he be singed

[Verr]
yeah there's a big like uh last ditch resort hopefully master didn't fuck it up you still have an action

[Referee (James)]
over ambitious spells

[Verr]
yeah that's right i was originally going to move but then i thought if it does blow up i might as well take everyone else with me like all these other small minions with me yeah um he doesn't get anything for one action i guess he's gonna run over here next to arthur sorry not arthur the um his companion the other one jimmy bud it keeps trying to target swarm it's gonna go up here a little bit further away oops sorry you can only move there yeah it's 25 ranger uh rangers out oh he's completely retreated that's fine yep um the potion gives him the potion gives him a plus 40 speed boost but he spends the

[Referee (James)]
minute running i don't mind if people who are retreating do fire back i also don't mind if they

[Verr]
just can't settle the retreat he can't okay like it's an emergency escape post you use it and you just basically book it for the next minute you can't do anything if you decide to run i'm getting

[Frogitha]
kidnapped um kiwi's gonna get kidnapped with her she's yeah not letting not letting a comrade go

[Referee (James)]
all right so both at this point of them have been killed so like a minus 30 modifier that's gonna bring them back to these guys are gonna break a fighting retreat which means this guy is just gonna straight up burrow 60 he's gonna be out of here water method has nobody fight so he's running thanks my fave do the same arsonist goblin how do i roll for i don't know what you do on your trip you've already stabilized so i'm is there anything nothing okay nope huh these guys have one success earlier so they're gonna try to like i said i'm just gonna give it three rolls between the two of them assuming a help action that was wrong i don't see the result of that it is incorrect whatever it is are we looking at it too long yeah they messed it up that's right

[Frogitha]
jimmy jimmy jimothy i choose you what are we what are we oh right uh what are we doing frostbite would do much unless those are water are they water or are they frost

[Referee (James)]
oh these so these guys are names that's fine so one of these is an ooze method and the other one okay the on the left is an ooze method on the right is a dust method

[Frogitha]
that's it just jump to bottom oh okay um i think because i don't think i can use forest barrage anymore because it's marked off right oh it's over ambitious spell

[Referee (James)]
um

[Frogitha]
all right um i don't have that so we're gonna we're gonna do oh no you do every mission spell

[Verr]
is on the um none of the spell section it's in the main section so it's an action

[Frogitha]
is that gonna burn arsonist goblin's body up though yes well if you cast fireball on her yeah

[Verr]
it will generally outright kill him yeah well then

[Frogitha]
oh i think that's you want to kill somebody without hitting

[Referee (James)]
arsonist goblin there's also acid grip there's a frostbite

[Frogitha]
that's what i'm doing frostbite so if they can just not get a 19

[Referee (James)]
they did not get a 19 buddy you're within 30 feet you could demoralize

[Frogitha]
i you know i could i could actually do i have anything or any other kind of uh basic action macro stuff basic action macro boom boom boo be gooves it's not tremendously effective jimmy jesus christ he be oh he be he's gonna trip them hold on of this i have this make an attack to knock a foe off balance melee strike if it hits

[Referee (James)]
well it doesn't increase till after you make both of them so basically you get

[Frogitha]
you get to do the you get to do an attack uh-huh do i do the plus two for um for whatever on this one or no

[Referee (James)]
what are you thinking of uh creature was last creature to damage you no not this guy

[Frogitha]
fuck it kibi dies kibi dies we're re-rolling

[Referee (James)]
all right

[Frogitha]
and i oh they're dead i don't even have to trip

[Referee (James)]
um my last action will be demoralized if you moved if you moved here instead of right below

[Frogitha]
them true that's true that's true thank you and then i can just smack them i don't do as much

[Referee (James)]
tutorializing outside of the tutorial content which is why i was like i was like i gotta bite my tongue oh fuck hit and that's damn hope rip them i think with the uh that was a separate attack the um oh right because that's an action okay slam down the two action thing and it does that well this combination actions there's one guy on the mat that has not yet gotten to fleeing and is probably wishing he has

[Verr]
oh where can you hear me yeah oh there we go oh sorry i forgot athel's me um so who's still just that guy yeah he hasn't he hasn't fled yet he's wishing he had yeah but if there's only one guy left might as well that's it yeah what happens to him um i can like reach out yanks him back over here crushing him and dissolving the body in the process

[Referee (James)]
oh shit he died all right very good guys add it to the uh turn tracker

[Frogitha]
how much money is this going to cost us uh you're going to make it back which is not something i say often so we're we don't have to start a gofundme to get our companions back 400 gold

[Referee (James)]
no signed because that ended up being over leveled for not pretty much everybody except for well that was kiwi no it was a rule for kiwi too arthur and jimmy are uh hyperventilating

[Frogitha]
uh i think we all you know what uh i deserve extra xp what are you doing excuse me trolling

[Referee (James)]
well stop it worry about it no you're gonna have it all right well you weren't far off so you guys are getting paid the uh let's put 120 gold in there uh they they are willing to pay you obviously for the companion that died say that again jimmy and arthur are obviously going to pay for the companion that died though they're they do state that they wish the his 30 gold share to be contributed to his resurrection fund rude besides the gold itself a lot of these methods are carrying maybe not necessarily carrying it they just leave behind these gems oh wow and you can see that there is a loot loot box are you barking about i'm gonna

[Frogitha]
i'm gonna go make sure the doors are locked these dogs make me paranoid no worries not gonna have to kill somebody all right everything's fine dogs it's fine all right well uh arsonist goblin obviously wants at least one of the orange ones still down here

[Verr]
still alive there's one still there they are fleeting they flew away

[Frogitha]
oh i'm gonna take two of the aragonite he's gonna actually just um i mean they just they just

[Referee (James)]
tried to sell them for their cost gold can't we yeah i think there's a pot on there

[Frogitha]
my name is treasure i don't know if you guys have access we do in our character sheets but not on the

[Verr]
on the thing itself what happens if i press this chucking converts all treasure to coins all right now we have to just divide that it should be at the end button just do it

[Referee (James)]
because we're out of the coin charge of stuff like that make sure it's in everybody oh only two people are selected i know why that's all right there's a ranger arsonist goblin

[Frogitha]
arsonist and kiwi there we go two left over i think we could safely give that to

[Verr]
um our fallen companion now look for full kuji who sacrificed himself

[Frogitha]
or he was sacrificed i should say kuji gets an extra two pieces of who also did kind of

[Referee (James)]
sacrifice herself as well man i was sitting there i was i'm thinking i'm like fucking move out of this war move out fucking disperse disperse serpentine you gotta move out i think you can't stay in the same square you're gonna fucking die please move i couldn't say anything it's not the tutorial so all right my oven's been on 400 for like uh for like an hour now and i'm gonna go check i'm pretty sure that one of my salmon dishes were not actually delivered oh uh and being that i live in the great state of texas that means i have to go kill somebody so i'll be right back

[Frogitha]
you're a goblin

[Speaker 5]
oh no

[Referee (James)]
all right what's the resurrection procedure i wish i could like for class features

[Frogitha]
filter out all the dedications oh i can't fuck me all right you can

[Referee (James)]
there's a cannon that i need to like unfuck my uh beach right the cannon is just the retraining feats entire time but getting rid of the so here's the thing is getting rid of the archetype feats um will also get rid of the ones that you are what the fuck is that noise

[Frogitha]
i don't have an archetype yet uh who arsonist goblin isn't i haven't picked one yet i have to pick one after this but i didn't want to i didn't want to pick anything because i'm weird i don't know about if i can pick an archetype all right if i can pick like a dedication can i also use my class feet after my archetype feet can i put my class feet as yes something from the okay cool

[Referee (James)]
i think there's virtually no feats that are like archetype feats that are available for aside from dedications there's not much that's available for level two if anything

[Frogitha]
i wish i knew what paths i could take for this like what is good later down on the line but i

[Referee (James)]
don't know anything so the great news is is i think every time that you fail to uh every time that you don't do downtime you can you can go back and be like all right my downtime is retraining pathfinder 2e lets you retrain things like these i don't know what unless it's just as fast as you can right there's it's not everything but gosh bear coming from 5e that might as well just be like a total fucking like the ability to retcon the entire campaign

[Frogitha]
i don't know what dedication to give them i love how you can retrain some of the racial

[Verr]
feats like long teeth or like bite attacks by filing your teeth down i love that so much and you can train into it by growing your teeth

[Referee (James)]
like alchemically shaping my teeth out

[Frogitha]
oh yeah i could make arsonist goblins scary by giving them a psychic dedication

[Referee (James)]
they could be scary

[Frogitha]
arsonist goblin has a great potential to be quite scary they don't have enough oh yeah they do have enough intelligence that's also kind of scary they're smart they just don't have any common sense me which is the minus one to wisdom oh yeah i guess maybe they would know how to read no they only know how to read goblin they don't know how to read common you can just say they're really high intelligence they have a plus two to intelligence so not really

[Verr]
high intelligence shouldn't they have like four or five languages known yeah but i i never pick

[Frogitha]
languages because i just don't see like like lore wise like why my character would know these

[Verr]
languages we'll just think about like uh living in south america you know a lot of people speak spanish so you know you pick some up along the way yeah you'd like have a passing familiarity with a bunch of languages you'd also not be able to read that but you know you've read the uh sds of a lot of the um fire stuff and so you learn other languages by reading the sds sheets not much is

[Frogitha]
known about kneeback they don't really have backstory other than prison so you know maybe they met some cool people in there or maybe they have an insanely weird backstory uh from before

[Verr]
well the prison has a really good reform program and teaches you bilingual

[Frogitha]
well they did get out so they're they're on they're on like probation or whatever whatever

[Verr]
the next step is i have no prisoner i don't know what comes off to prison demolitionist can i pay for a reincarnation instead of resurrection

[Frogitha]
a firework technician oh my god what do you get from this oh you gotta be trained in crafting i don't think they're trained in crafting level two skill fees first repeat okay i guess they couldn't

[Referee (James)]
be that was instead of uh methods themselves that's like doing that it should have been uh

[Frogitha]
wisps coming off level zero guys oh god the ones that don't that just eat magic

[Verr]
oh do they yeah i'd have been pissed so uh what you do is you roll a 1d 20 for reincarnation to determine what kind of creature type so 19 would be a rare rule and then so you choose how many rare um what rare type of ancestries would be found nearby so an uncommon ancestry and then so you draw a 1d whatever how many options are able then i become that race oh that's fun i like that that is fun so if you want to look through the ancestral list and just see how many would potentially be in this region and then you assign each one a number and then roll a id of the number of races and i become that race do you keep all your memories yeah so that'll be in the thing a wish let's just like

[Frogitha]
explode there tattooed historian would be really funny considering their prison background

[Referee (James)]
but you gotta be an orc yep have a look at some ancestry

[Frogitha]
would make wild mimic dedication excuse me but i can't make them aware creature the vindicator

[Referee (James)]
i had to leave your lizard folk ancestry

[Verr]
who could also add rare if you want i'm gonna press that i had a funny thought uh

[Referee (James)]
there are there are 19 there are 19 rare options on a 20 i'm going to on a 20 or a one i'm going to choose something funny for me go ahead and roll the d20

[Verr]
please can i pick

[Referee (James)]
i don't want you i think a 20 or a one i think all right so 14 so one two three six seven and then well 13 14 aww it was very close if you got a 15 it would have been sprite which was the toss-up i was gonna either i was gonna either choose sprite or pop it with the funny options uh but right above sprite is skeleton

[Frogitha]
oh my god you're a skeleton now oh i love that so much

[Referee (James)]
skelly man

[Frogitha]
holy shit oh you know who's gonna love you dr basha

[Verr]
my flesh didn't come back what's going on exactly

[Referee (James)]
like so i think all three i think there have been three deaths if i'm not mistaken in the in this campaign so far and uh all three of them with well Nessie Nessie was killed by like a by like an escape encounter it wasn't really technically a combat but every all the other ones were killed by swarms two which were said to be swarms yeah there it is outer hazard that's so funny so it kind of failed right now you you put it on there just i'm gonna whatever you say i'm gonna pin it

[Speaker 4]
that's excellent what is it i return with no flesh

[Referee (James)]
the resurrection pops off the flesh doesn't come back with them oh wow that's really funny uh so what is what is being a skelly man uh do to you

[Verr]
uh negative healing there you go

[Frogitha]
i need a familiar i just got familiar master dedication oh didn't have any prerequisites or anything so i guess that's okay uh we're comrades until the end uh how do i get one i meditate under the moon until something crept out of the forest okay that's just one option oh it's got to be a rat that i smuggled out of prison right uh you infuse your familial yeah okay cool

[Referee (James)]
instead of a flaming otter elemental that is a rat elemental so do i need the familiar feet if i

[Frogitha]
have the familiar master dedication is that familiar master dedication gives you the familiar thing okay cool gives me the in hand no it just gives me the familiar okay cool no no if you already

[Referee (James)]
have the familiar you get the enhanced familiar fourth level there's familiar mascot

[Frogitha]
all right so i'll i don't have the familiar thing so i just go ahead and get an enhanced familiar

[Verr]
all right no no no if you don't have a familiar fate you get the regular familiar if you already have the familiar fate you get the enhanced familiar fate so i can't upgrade it and get the enhanced familiar no you can't level four

[Frogitha]
it's well i could have gotten and i as a class beat i could have gotten um this familiar and

[Verr]
then gotten and yeah if you want to do that you can get it otherwise you can get a level four

[Referee (James)]
depending on how you want to do it yeah vera was saying if he didn't if you got something else you

[Frogitha]
just wait until okay we'll do that so i have enhanced now oh god i hate picking fucking skill feats not skill feats uh class feats what am i gonna pick gotta be something

[Referee (James)]
more familiar or master abilities each day instead of two and now i'm gonna look for familiar among these pokeball oh you're gonna pick a random one well it's gotta be level well within it's gotta be not level appropriate but level within reason i don't know where do i find familiar all right we're gonna check net this first and then we're

[Verr]
gonna so if you get a familiar you go to classes and then there's an option there for familiars and a specific familiars do you know what do you want to roll for one

[Referee (James)]
oops i pressed the wrong button what do you mean that that can't be reached no

[Verr]
oh well first essentially you can have anything that you want as a familiar

[Frogitha]
but some have a requirement i wonder if there's any fire elemental familiars

[Verr]
yeah so to get a fire elemental familiar you need to have i think they're like four class feature later uh elemental is three so if i get one now can i get a different familiar later yeah so it takes a bit of time to change it i think it's like a week familiars are more

[Referee (James)]
powerful than the so what i'm looking at right now are specific familiars uh the ones that are um from player core 2 is this the same thing or is that something different i want a fire elemental

[Frogitha]
i want a cinder rat that's cool and so you got the element twist yeah i'm looking at the archives of nefes and i found fire elemental as his animal companion one and then it says your companion is a fire elemental such as a cinder rat or a lava otter

[Verr]
yeah so essentially uh there's like if you can get like um it really specifies what you can and can't do you can just choose like any pet animal really but then it needs to have like the following abilities to make it so if it needs to be flying it needs to have the flyer feet you know things like that

[Frogitha]
what did you say about the levels it has to be the same level as me

[Verr]
so it's your level okay but for like the specific familiars you need to have that amount of ability points

[Frogitha]
to use on to have that as a pet someone smarter than me tell me if i can use a cinder rat

[Referee (James)]
uh i was gonna have them uh give you one of these from the what is this required number of abilities five uh oh i could just do this on a new tab

[Frogitha]
what am i thinking i can't wait to pick up tattoo artist as a feat

[Referee (James)]
um this is the okay so elemental is one and i don't have any special speeds fast movements too uh as far as i could tell you only need two for um so with uh with the mess with the uh enhanced familiar thing because you're you're taking both of them at the same time you get the familiar feed and then you get the enhanced one because you're taking that dedication right if i'm reading this correctly you only need two abilities in order

[Frogitha]
to or make the cinder rat can you pull it into my uh give me pull one into my foreground and give me command over it

[Verr]
so essentially what you do is you just make a new character sheet that's a familiar and then you give the traits that you want the animal to have and then you name it and voila

[Referee (James)]
i'm gonna create a little test one here it's not familiar it says total number of familiar abilities is two but that should be four when i set it to when i set the master to arsonist goblin first i'm gonna grab the one that doesn't cannot be given that he can work on the past aspergill land that's up there i open it back up

[Frogitha]
i don't know anything about the cinder rat i just it fit her aesthetic his aesthetic it's aesthetic basically it's just a rat the that's pretty cool it does fire damage that's all i need

[Verr]
that's the name of bernie you can do a tattoo transformation it turns into a tattoo on your own flesh wait wait wait say that again you can get tattoo transformation it's essentially it's one of the abilities you can choose so you're familiar you can transfer it transform

[Referee (James)]
into a tattoo you carry on your flesh where is this i see uh go ahead and click on all right i'm gonna do two things first i'm gonna add enhance familiar as a bonus feed to your sheet that was the last thing i was missing i said you're gonna name him bernie yeah like bernie sanders turn e okay can you see bernie inside the

[Frogitha]
all right go ahead and click on that guy

[Referee (James)]
now anytime you want to see this there's the um there's the nethis thing and then inabilities

[Frogitha]
i don't have like i don't think i have control over him i don't i don't see anything it's completely blank for me other than the name fire mini and tiny picture and master i figured

[Referee (James)]
if you had if you had that damn it i figured if you had ownership over its master then we just automatically transfer there we go so i added enhanced familiar as a bonus feed to your character sheet so it doesn't get confused with anything else so now the total number of abilities is fixed you can see right now i've added elemental fire and fast movement land so the cinder rat has a movement speed of 40 that's what boosts its movement speed to 40 and it's an elemental it's

[Verr]
fire so how would i so if you have the yeah so that'd be three feet what how many feet did you

[Referee (James)]
say that was we're not talking about feats we're talking about abilities yeah that's right sorry how many ability did you say no so if you i think you should be able to view it i'm not sure because i'm not sure what the um you you look at it on the ref account there's just two on there elemental

[Verr]
familiar fire and fast movement land so that's you'd need for elemental you'll need the resistance trait resistance familiarity just like the elemental and then i believe if there's a mouse need to send oh so i can't have bernie no no you would have bernie but that would basically be all your points what do you mean all my points what points so when you get the familiar you get two points to spend on traits and certain the style of the creature you need to spend an amount of traits so just say like if you want an owl you know it needs a flyer flyer trait which gives it a 25 fly speed um if you want the elemental trait you need to have it resistant to element you want to pick and then the elemental trait and that changes it from animal to an elemental okay

[Referee (James)]
and then sir must have the resistance familiar now you're right here is to the following classical electricity now the way that you have that ability look next to abilities you'll see a little magnifying glass that says browse that brings up all of the different familiar abilities

[Verr]
so then if you get extra so you can spend it on other things so like when i level up i would get or no so with the feet so having the normal familiar feet you get two when you get enhanced familiar it gives you four and then there's like another one that gives you like six

[Frogitha]
and then you get bonuses depending on something about a tattoo what where is this so this is the

[Verr]
very first one it's tattoo transformation so you know you can transform into a tattoo flesh when trans itself and can't act except to turn into back into familiar so you can carry it around on you and whenever you need it it like peels off your flesh oh that's cool i can't wait to get that one

[Frogitha]
because i'm getting i i picked um i picked skill training for my skill fee and did crafting so that next time i can um i can get what is it uh the tattoo i can be a tattoo artist that would fit the vibe oh hi sweet boy all right so i just pick two more skills for him so if you want wanted to

[Verr]
go like a cinder rat it'd basically all your skills to do that okay although i don't know

[Frogitha]
if you'd go elemental though um i don't know how to see those the traits required it's in the

[Verr]
oh yeah so in the overview would be like just a roof of familiars i have the cinder rat pulled up and i don't exactly know so essentially you wouldn't be making a cinder rat you'd just be

[Frogitha]
um making the equivalent of it fire elemental immunities to fire weakness to cold and water

[Referee (James)]
i really need this picture for

[Frogitha]
yeah um so i got two abilities so far i just don't know which ones are i just don't know which ones make

[Referee (James)]
um a cinder rat oh he's got a so really it's three you get a that's my place all right are you clicked on birdie yep and then go to abilities which you might already be on and this is one of the compendium browsers it lets you go over everything that it's looking for uh what you want to look for in the little search text box for the upper left is resistance so i think you misunderstand so you

[Verr]
wouldn't exactly be copying a stat block from a cinder rat you'd be using the stats to create a creature similar to it that you would refer to as a cinder rat so if you're after more of a companion like a cinder rat like for a combat creature you'd need it as a companion so like a like a beast master or something along those lines rather than a familiar so if you want like your companions a fire elemental such as a cinder rat or a lava otter that would be a companion not a familiar i'm just mimicking it um which i would probably recommend did you want your rat to like attack or did you just want it to offer some bonuses

[Frogitha]
i was hoping for an attack things that you could do with the familiar like you

[Referee (James)]
cast spells from its position yeah what what class is arsonist goblin sorcerer you're not completely non-combat you still have strike no yeah so i

[Verr]
think of familiars as supportive creatures where a companion is a combatant so you can get a you can get like a a cinder rat as a fire elemental companion if you go like beast master

[Frogitha]
okay i got beast master um so what do uh let's see so when how do i get more abilities for a familiar i know i asked this before but i am tired with feats okay at this stage

[Referee (James)]
remember the character is only level two basically leveling up and uh and selecting the feats that are appropriate for it i like the

[Frogitha]
like versatility of a familiar because i can just choose different things to make to give it so i don't think you can really do anything right now canny

[Referee (James)]
he's just kind of there yeah so that's what i'm saying did you elemental nope you still got

[Verr]
you got that one ability left so if you want instead of going a familiar out there you could go like beast master and with gm fiat you could have your cinder rat and then you can use that to run up to creatures and like buy an attack and scratch and later and you'll get bonuses for it hmm at a higher level it'll it'll be able to do like a flamethrower

[Speaker 5]
yeah you don't want to do that

[Verr]
because that would be the animal companions and so if you go down to like fire elemental you can get like an animal companion such as like a cinder rat or a larva

[Frogitha]
get rid of the familiar and the familiar master dedication that way i can do beast master so just make sure it's right

[Verr]
with james that you're able to get a fire familiar as a companion god i can work up to it because generally the requirements for my fire familiar is from the flame holder

[Frogitha]
i mean it could also just be it could also be a quest like i wouldn't mind it being like a

[Referee (James)]
they're literally handing it to you is um oh okay the fruits of the fruits of this endeavor i think you're elemental i see what you mean now when you say like this is much more focused on combat and like an active role rather than like a support role

[Verr]
yeah so familiars are good for supportive like they'll give you bonuses two class bonuses alchemist extra reagents they can cast spells but like minus four of your maximum soul level so it's pretty not much until like level 13 but essentially a familiar offers a greater passive ability and supporting roles where an actual companion would be like combat focused and you can use this into your three archetypes to get like companion like to say like kuji and kaiju they're both animal companions and you know if you're an action shy of you know being as good as any some of the other players basically hit points normally most people but they're a bit more rigid in their abilities

[Referee (James)]
oh i feel myself stopping

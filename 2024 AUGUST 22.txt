[Speaker 1]
If it comes in, then we can have her jump in, but otherwise, that's totally fine. Alright, we left off last time with you guys engaging in combat.

[Speaker 3]
Are you sure we can't wait for Otter?

[Speaker 1]
Otter can make it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but can we?

[Speaker 1]
Can you wait for Otter?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like I'd have to text her or call her, because I think she slept through her alarm. Which I totally can, I'll text her.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can do that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because I know she didn't want to miss this out, because she bugged me about this session. Unless her phone died, then... We just have to...

[Speaker 1]
To catch everybody up, you guys heard that there was a demon of sorts hidden inside of this hollow from the pixies that you befriended. Or rather, you befriended their direwolves, thanks to some quick thinking.

[Speaker 3]
Eggs. Eggs? Is that what you're talking about?

[Speaker 1]
There's a pixie village inside of this hollow, which is currently being attacked by very large... Very, very large... Soldiers and a...

There we go, a legion of... An arm... Sorry.

Soldiers from the Bone Gnar's Legion of Hobgoblins. Accompanied by a whole bunch of ogres. A few goblins here and there, but they're primarily hobgoblins and ogres.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like Charis would have loved this pixie... pixie hollow.

[Speaker 6]
Probably.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Too bad she's in space.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Do we still have initiative? We don't. They're all dead, right?

Howdy. Hi!

[Speaker 1]
No, you killed the initial ones that you found.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Oh shit, there are so many more!

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, there's so many more.

[Speaker 2]
I forgot I had to zoom out!

[Speaker 7]
That's under attack.

[Speaker 3]
Someone play Pera. Wait, Pera's not here. Maybe we don't have a healer.

Do we have a healer?

[Speaker 7]
I have Leia on hands.

[Speaker 3]
Enough. Welcome back. The most heal-y thing that Susudio can do is bite people.

[Speaker 4]
Splendid. Well...

[Speaker 2]
Nox has healing, but is he still... I don't know what he was. Stunned or something?

No. Was he? He's not letting me see.

Is he dominated?

[Speaker 3]
He has the grabbed symbol. He's been grabbed.

[Speaker 2]
I know he was, in some way, unable to do anything. I don't know if that effect has worn off since the person died. I say we just start and then Otter will hop in when she does.

[Speaker 6]
Goodbye. Oh, hello.

[Speaker 5]
Hi, I just woke up.

[Speaker 6]
Yay! Morning.

[Speaker 2]
It was really weird texting you, I gotta say.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, somehow I slept through everything.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I was figuring.

[Speaker 5]
I had like three alarms. It happens.

[Speaker 4]
It happens to the best of us.

[Speaker 5]
So what have I missed?

[Speaker 2]
Nothing. We almost started and then Froggeth got scared and wanted to waste you.

[Speaker 3]
There's a lot of enemies.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, rightfully so. She got scared rightfully so. I wasn't scared because I didn't see them, so, you know, ignorance is bliss.

[Speaker 5]
Now I have to go through and check all my messages.

[Speaker 2]
I only sent you two.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, did you just drop something?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, pivot. There you go. Sorry.

It also says Nox is cursed.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, what?

[Speaker 2]
It also says Nox is cursed.

[Speaker 6]
I missed a lot. How did you get cursed? I don't remember.

I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
Oh dear. What?

[Speaker 6]
Hmm?

[Speaker 5]
I just swapped my headphones over.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
I was saying Nox's temporary effects is cursed and dominate monster, so... Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Are we in the middle of this fight? I remember a lot less guys.

[Speaker 1]
You guys finished the previous fight? Now that there has been something of a ruckus from this side, the uh... These folks are going to be a lot less...

These folks are paying attention now. They're no longer just, like, stomping through pixie homes.

[Speaker 3]
So now they're like, what the fuck? Hey. Charge ahead, I suppose.

[Speaker 2]
Am I still, like, immobile, incapacitated, whatever?

[Speaker 1]
You are no longer stunned, though.

[Speaker 2]
Stunned, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 7]
It's time to kick more goblin ass.

[Speaker 3]
Are we ready? Because Kiwi's going to charge over there if we're ready.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's fine. Agnes is sitting on top of...

[Speaker 4]
Kiwi, leave some for me! I'll just watch the fight and join in when you're done.

[Speaker 2]
You weren't here last time.

[Speaker 4]
I...

[Speaker 8]
I think I missed the end of it. You wanted to put a character in.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um... They... The ground that we're walking on is prickly and will damage you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
I'm walking around on the water, then, and...

[Speaker 2]
On the water, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Um, hey. I can make a bridge.

[Speaker 2]
Um... How does... And then, like, get stabbed through our feet.

[Speaker 7]
How does that work? You roll the die. And you get a number of feet.

Or a number of, like, five-foot cubes.

[Speaker 1]
Equal to the... Equal to the dice result. So if you roll a Lakekeeper die and you get a five, then you get five...

Cubes. Of five foot.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that is not what I wanted. Oops.

[Speaker 7]
Should I be long-rested for this, or...? Um...

[Speaker 2]
If you weren't here last time...

[Speaker 7]
Sure, this is still technically, like, a week in the future, so...

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Is it for all of us, or...? Yeah, for you guys still, because you guys traveled for, like, uh... Two... I think you traveled for a total of, like, 17 days?

Or maybe it was, like, 23 days? Last session? Not since the last battle, though.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, we don't get... We don't get a rest.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you do not get a rest.

[Speaker 2]
Heart failed to get the rest.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're very silly.

[Speaker 6]
Five times besides... So... I guess I will just use...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, wait, what is my... What is a warlock? A d8.

I'll use half of them. Get 30 square... No, five...

Five times 30? Is that how that works? 30 squares.

[Speaker 7]
Hey, James. Hello. As soon as we have a bit of downtime before combat begins...

May I use... Oh.

[Speaker 2]
No, we're going straight into combat, but... Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Is there anyone I should avoid hitting, or is it just everyone on this... Everyone that's not us is getting them?

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 4]
Cool.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I'm talking to myself. Don't take that as an answer.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, right. Is there anyone I should avoid hitting, or is everyone who's not us...

[Speaker 2]
That one. Anyone who's not us at this moment. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Are the Nixies still a problem?

[Speaker 7]
Probably a problem if they come attack you guys.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. Wait. Hang on.

That doesn't look right. You can't see them right now.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, she might be able to. Her warlock eyes.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, for some reason it is technically showing me, but I'm acting as though I know they are invisible. Because I don't know what's causing that.

[Speaker 1]
You might be able to see invisible creatures.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I looked through my features and I couldn't find what was giving me that. Um... Because I know I have some vision stuff, but...

Oh, shit. I didn't look at items. Anyway, um...

So, I rolled a 30, and then I times it by 5?

[Speaker 2]
That's a long bridge.

[Speaker 1]
So basically you get 30... You get 30 cubes. You get 30 spaces.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so that's what this is.

[Speaker 1]
And you can arrange that however you want, by the way. Yeah, um...

[Speaker 2]
You can do like little stone steps, so like every other... Oh!

[Speaker 5]
You know what? I assumed it had to be connected, though. Um...

And I still assume that. There is not a 30 wide thing. There we go.

There's my bridge.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Yeah. Right across the room.

Does it go on top of them? What happens then?

[Speaker 1]
I assume it's just going over them. Or next to them.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. There's 5 foot of space. Um...

So there is a safe space. Uh, to be.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 5]
Can I make it stand out a bit more?

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna deposit Agnes on it.

[Speaker 6]
I can select a fill texture. Yeah! How long is this, then?

Yeah, 150 feet.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, Aggie. Go over here. Oh, I shut the door on myself.

That's annoying. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Folks, go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 2]
There's no combat encounter.

[Speaker 1]
There's no combat encounter. There is now a combat encounter. Fuck you.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, let's fucking do this.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee, fuck yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Keebee, smash.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm waiting on these guys. Are these guys ruling initiative?

[Speaker 5]
I think it's secret until we actually get into initiative.

[Speaker 1]
Let's just need to properly add them.

[Speaker 3]
Let me know when I can move. Do I have to use this right here?

[Speaker 5]
You don't have to if you have an alternative route. It's just this is a safe spot to walk.

[Speaker 3]
Can I travel under all of this? Over, like, on the water? Or is it solid?

[Speaker 1]
No, those are houses. Very small houses.

[Speaker 3]
Otter did make a bridge so you can use her sanctity. Yeah. I don't want to block everyone, though.

I'll hop down after.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, where do you go? Right there. Oh, okay.

You're still at the top of the initiative. That's totally fine. I'm going to draw everybody's attention to the big fucker.

[Speaker 3]
Which one? There's two of them.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so he is... First of all, you are not CR6.

[Speaker 3]
The top ugly one.

[Speaker 1]
Both very ugly.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, top one is uglier.

[Speaker 1]
Right, holy shit.

[Speaker 2]
If you zoom out, the bottom one looks like an angry cat, so...

[Speaker 1]
So the one that's right here that I'm pinging is wearing plate. He has two, like, burning... You can't quite...

His face is mostly obscured. You can't quite see it, but there are, like, two burning eyes just peering out from this unnatural dark. And he's wielding a very, very, very obviously magical greatsword in one hand.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Does my rage carry over from the last battle, or do I need to rage again?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it can carry over from the last battle.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool, because I only have two left. Alright, well, I guess I'll attack this little goblin dude. Ooh, what is this?

[Speaker 1]
That is a squad of goblins.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, I'll attack that one, actually.

[Speaker 1]
Squad goblin. Squad goblin.

[Speaker 3]
I guess that does have area of effect stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, good to know.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Reckless. Hey, team. Hello.

Hey. Alright, so 13 to 16 to 9, then a 1 on this squad. There you go.

So, it would take...

[Speaker 3]
And if the first hit kills, which it won't, but if it does...

[Speaker 1]
If it kills one goblin, then a 10 to 10, which would then get reduced.

[Speaker 3]
I still have bonus action. Oh, did I already roar? No, I didn't.

Oh, do it.

[Speaker 8]
This is my fight, son.

[Speaker 6]
I actually love that for TV. Okay, alright, how many creatures of my choice? It doesn't say how many.

They're just within, like, 10 feet of you.

[Speaker 3]
Which is... Okay, so that's these three. Unless I can, like, hop over to this right here.

And I think I can get more.

[Speaker 6]
Can I do that? And give him an opportunity attack? No.

Because reaction rolls... If I use a reaction roll to hit back, that won't be a bonus action, right?

[Speaker 3]
That'll just be a reaction roll.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, can you say it one more time?

[Speaker 3]
So, if I jump to whatever this is right here to get within 10 feet of multiple... You know what, never mind. I'll just do this.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so they will make an opportunity attack against you.

[Speaker 3]
And is attacking back with my martial dice a reaction roll, or is it a bonus action? Because I think it's a reaction roll.

[Speaker 1]
Can I still do a bonus action if I do a reaction roll? But reaction... So...

If you mean, like, an attack of opportunity or something like that. Do you mean, like, parried?

[Speaker 6]
It is... Parried is a reaction, I think. This.

Riposte. Riposte. Yeah.

Not going to. It's if somebody misses you with melee attack.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that's it.

[Speaker 6]
But that would be a reaction.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Ignore that, though. I'm just gonna roar at them.

So, these three need to make a DC wisdom of 17? Or a saving throw?

[Speaker 6]
These guys still have four left. Damn. Yeah.

Hobgoblin has... What's this guy's charisma modifier? Is plus three.

Damn, he makes it. All of them would succeed. The R is within 10 feet, right?

It's just these three. Paladins R is what I'm talking about. Oh no, that's all you.

I'm just roaring. No, I gotcha. Alright, so I think they all succeed.

Ugh, okay. Kibi's not getting out of the way. So, you can crawl over her if you want to.

No! No, you should not wait! Drop in!

Yeah, get in here. This is what we want to do. I want to just, like...

[Speaker 1]
Let's just put that there. Hmm. Just give it a little...

There you go. Now he's a little bit easier to see. Get hovered by anybody.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I just mixed up quests.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Alright, so, Kibi, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 2]
It is.

[Speaker 1]
Nox!

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Okay, um... He's mad.

Let's see, how far can he go? He has zero walk. Why is he still in an effect?

[Speaker 5]
It doesn't look like you've taken it off yourself.

[Speaker 2]
He's still grappled and stunned. Okay, hang on. Alright, there we go.

Okay. Oh, I assume I have to, like, follow... Okay, well.

[Speaker 5]
You could probably also walk across the, um, that space.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, he's got reach.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Well, I love buffers. Okay.

Uh...

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna assume that hits.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Can I just leave him if he's dead?

[Speaker 7]
You're taking that long.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, she's dead.

[Speaker 6]
Cool. I'm...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Let's see. Are these guys fey or fiend?

[Speaker 5]
I think they're goblin.

[Speaker 2]
Nevermind, it doesn't matter. It's an action.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go. Yeah. Alright, anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, come on. Wait.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so... Probably won't take out a bunch of these guys at once. Let's assume...

Did I... Do that? And not hit anyone.

There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, hold on.

[Speaker 4]
Does that get kibi in it? If so, I might want to move it a little bit backwards.

[Speaker 1]
No, you could... That could miss kibi.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think kibi's in it anyway.

[Speaker 5]
I think what you're seeing is my square.

[Speaker 6]
Ah. Yeah, I... Probably.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, kibi would fail that and get hurt really badly.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so it should hit everyone on the right with kibi, and let me roll for damage.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, surprising. Did the captains get... Did any of these guys get the bonus?

[Speaker 6]
Who would have made it if they got them? That's a beautiful aura right there.

[Speaker 8]
Do you want to drop in silk, like, at the bottom of the order?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that'll be fine.

[Speaker 4]
Right. If all that's done, I will wink at kibi and give her bardic inspiration.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi blushes. What does that look like on her fur? I think that it's just like a ripple.

[Speaker 2]
Aww, that's cute.

[Speaker 3]
Aww.

[Speaker 2]
I think they're getting, like, a little bit fluffier. Like, when they kind of, like, swoosh their cheeks out a little bit.

[Speaker 8]
Your face sinks in to your fur, like Homer Simpson.

[Speaker 4]
Right, and that will be all. Action, bonus action.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
That will have to be his. There we go, cool. I think that's all of them.

That guy does take a toll. If only one of the squads succeeded. There we go.

All right. Princess Dazio.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm, spooky.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna do this. Oh, this one's harder to not get kibi in.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's got a high con. Just chance it. If you have to.

Obviously don't if you don't have to.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I think right here misses kibi by one. Because it changes shade. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm. Sickening Radiance might belong.

[Speaker 1]
That one, I'm going to attempt to counterspell. I have to roll.

[Speaker 6]
Aha! Can I counterspell that? I was just gonna ask that part.

You can indeed. That's all.

[Speaker 2]
Just picturing wizards getting into a counterspell fight. Feels like it's like a times infinity.

[Speaker 1]
Or starts its turn there. Okay, that's gonna be a little bit easier to resolve. I don't have to roll all of these right this second.

Thank god.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, I should pop that out for you then.

[Speaker 1]
I'm also going to pop it out.

[Speaker 8]
Pop it out, pop it in. Let me begin.

[Speaker 1]
Message. You can actually have a separate window here. Yes, excellent.

Okay. Anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 5]
Bonus action... No. I will do a little fly though.

Probably... Let's see, where do I feel like flying? I don't really think I need to get that closer.

I'll do a little fly over here. Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And temporary hit points there down to four squad members. They're gonna start off... Okay, attack DB.

[Speaker 3]
Bring it. That hits. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Additional 19 plus 9, so 28 damage.

[Speaker 3]
So do I half the martial advantage damage as well?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Uh...

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Uh... Next, I have...

Somebody's got an alarm.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's a thing for a goblin.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Leadership, I like that. What the fuck is going on with that?

Fucking asshole, come here.

[Speaker 1]
It's three from the oathbreaker. 13. What's his leadership die?

He's added D4. Nope. He's going to...

He's going to do supper, I think. The damage was 13?

[Speaker 5]
I believe so.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Yes, 13. You can't call that one out, tragically.

[Speaker 6]
Within range.

[Speaker 1]
Within, like, disadvantage range. That's not gonna help. Okay.

Uh... I am going to... Yeah, so he's just gonna...

Move up. Gonna sidle in with his squad here. And he's gonna attack DB.

Do it. That does it. Twice.

We're gonna add leadership to that. Nope, we're not. Because that's still missed horribly.

I rolled a 1 and a 9. Jesus. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna... The first one hits, but the second one doesn't. So I'm just gonna hit back.

He's, like, right next to me.

[Speaker 6]
Mhm.

[Speaker 5]
Shouldn't he have disadvantage? Or not advantage?

[Speaker 3]
He should be at advantage because I'm...

[Speaker 1]
Because I recklessed.

[Speaker 5]
But also, with Sickening Radiance, he gets an exhaustion.

[Speaker 1]
Exhaustion is... Disadvantage on...

[Speaker 5]
Ability checks. Okay. Ability checks.

I see that now. I just saw checks.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. My sword attack... Is that an advantage, I think?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No advantage. It only hits.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. So that's... 21?

Yeah, I masked.

[Speaker 1]
Captains cannot vary.

[Speaker 2]
I'm so proud of you.

[Speaker 1]
You can't. Alright. So this one would be a C kill.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Amazing. Fuck that guy.

Throw him in the water.

[Speaker 1]
Stacking. Wait, nope. How'd you get in there?

Alright. Next hobgoblin captain has to do the same thing. Sitting for all.

Needs a small bonus. Next to the Earthbreaker. And succeeds.

Want to take... Half damage, I believe.

[Speaker 5]
I actually don't think he takes half damage.

[Speaker 1]
Does he take no damage?

[Speaker 5]
It doesn't say he takes any damage on a success.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay. Wait, no!

[Speaker 3]
The hell happened?

[Speaker 1]
I just... I deleted what I was about to write, and actually took away all my hit points, which is probably what I should have expected.

[Speaker 6]
So this guy's going to jump over, quickly lose.

[Speaker 1]
Looks like heart. No, heart left. He's going to jump over, and attempt to attack Hesio.

[Speaker 6]
Water ritual.

[Speaker 1]
I need Hesio to make me a concentration check. Yes. Uggy.

I need the computer, please.

[Speaker 2]
That's the real reason you need to check your concentration, the damn cat.

[Speaker 5]
And double check if I have that. I do not.

[Speaker 1]
You still succeed, though.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to push my keyboard under the thing. Okay, now you have space, Bubby.

[Speaker 1]
That is his turn. We have another hobgoblin squad, which is going to make a... attempt to make a save.

They are going to move out of range, and they are now going to attempt to hurt Hesio. Yeah. The rest of their squads here do not die.

These guys only have four. Twenty-four to hit. Yes.

Oh, twenty-eight damage. That would fail by two.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I don't think I have anything that boosts constitution. I don't think... I'm not in Orbalis.

[Speaker 1]
No Orbalis today. No Orbalis fucking up my plans today.

[Speaker 6]
After the Oathbreaker. Are you back? Yep.

Sorry, battery died. Welcome back.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Oh, it's in the actions here.

[Speaker 3]
When you say your battery died, does your computer just, like, die?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm using my laptop. Oh, okay. My apologies.

You're good.

[Speaker 3]
You feeded a hot dog.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that does not seem great. Who's that to?

[Speaker 1]
That is in a thirty-foot radius.

[Speaker 4]
Oh! Oh, caramba.

[Speaker 3]
Well, hold on. Kibi has... Let's see.

This. Each creature of my choice within thirty feet has advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's good, they're gonna need it.

[Speaker 3]
I cannot be frightened.

[Speaker 7]
Look at that emo fuck.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, fancy.

[Speaker 1]
Wouldn't know how to do his proper or... Oh, wait, no, no, it did work.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you might want to turn the attenuation either up or down. I don't remember which one it is. Just so the edge is a little more clear.

[Speaker 8]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
That's a thirty-foot radius. Man, that's spooky. Very.

It's very cool, too. All right, bonus action. We're gonna attempt to attack Kibi with these shadows.

Is that, like, a melee spell attack? I'm just gonna do a... Where's the beat, man?

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, I want that. Oh my god, yep, that hits. Now is that...

What kind of damage is that?

[Speaker 1]
Necrotic.

[Speaker 3]
Necrotic. Okay, ouch.

[Speaker 1]
Also going to pop this out for myself. Pop out message. Get a blue window.

Get a dragon here. Okay. That, he's gonna move a little bit, but that is his turn here.

Oh, I think I get to use martial advantage. Wait, no, because it wasn't a weapon attack. That brings us to the bolt launcher.

Jesus. Time for the simple shit now. Attack against common.

Total of seventeen damage. Let's see. This guy is literally firing a ballista at you.

He's just holding it.

[Speaker 6]
At who?

[Speaker 1]
At common.

[Speaker 6]
Why?

[Speaker 1]
To be mean. All right, we have a Goblin Iron Shadow here. He's going to teleport to another point of shadow.

And attack Kiki. Use shadow jaunt, and then she'll use four attacks, I didn't know that.

[Speaker 3]
Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
Another miss. Embarrassing. Oh my god!

[Speaker 3]
All right, you get one hit.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, I'm gonna add a d4 to that.

[Speaker 3]
Aww.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, still misses. Okay, okay. Very light d4 damage.

The Booyah! Who is miraculously still alive. He's gonna use a classic.

[Speaker 6]
What does it do?

[Speaker 1]
Your Oath of An... What level Oath of Ancients are you, by the way?

[Speaker 2]
Oh... Um... You know, it's nine?

[Speaker 1]
Because I think that you have resistance to spell damage.

[Speaker 6]
Or it might just be magical damage, period.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's Aura of Warding damage to spell resistance. And then the sword also does something like that, too.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I need everybody in that circle, though, to make me a...

[Speaker 2]
Nope.

[Speaker 6]
What is it?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so ten foot radius of me. I get advantage on saving throws. I get spells and other magical effects from the sword, and also that.

[Speaker 3]
I get advantage on saving throws, right? As a monk?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, but if you succeed, you get, um...

[Speaker 2]
What am I... What are we rolling for?

[Speaker 7]
Fireball save. Everybody who's in that tent up there gets hit by a fireball.

[Speaker 2]
So, nox and agni...

[Speaker 5]
I don't think nox is in it. Nox isn't in it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I thought nox was in it. That was my bad.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Agnus is gonna die.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah!

[Speaker 8]
Sylk burns a charge of his Ring of Evasion to pass it instead of failing. I assume he fails with a 12. He would fail with a 12.

The DC's 14, though. I don't think Sylk is in it where you placed him. Oh.

Never mind. I retroactively claim that charge back. Good strategy, good strategy.

Maybe I could run into the fireball.

[Speaker 2]
Could you lay on me?

[Speaker 8]
There's a hireling that...

[Speaker 1]
I fell a dinner of bodyguards in a building called Get Down that they will knock you to the ground.

[Speaker 7]
I need to make a concentration saving throw for my Shield of Faith that I still have up.

[Speaker 1]
24 fire damage on a fail. 12 on a success.

[Speaker 7]
I do concentration saves work. I'm assuming 20 is a success.

[Speaker 1]
It's 10 or half the damage, whichever is higher.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
That is the Booyog's turn. I'm also gonna have the paladin. I'm gonna have the Oathbreaker invade his buddy's space here.

I redulled.

[Speaker 7]
Alright. 5, 10, 15, 20. Kibi!

[Speaker 3]
Yeah?

[Speaker 7]
Let's harden you up. I'm using all 25 points of healing. So get yourself up in shape.

[Speaker 3]
Nice, thank you.

[Speaker 7]
And that's my action. Now for my bonus action. Where is you?

I actually know command isn't a bonus action. Fuck! I actually think that's my turn.

Fuck. That is 25 points of healing. Oh, I can use my bonus action for this.

If you'll allow it. What is this? Say what you're doing.

It's not let me fuck you. Say what you're doing! Say it with your voice!

Use your words! Using my channel divinity to restore a spell slot with the optional feature.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. Alright, so Sudio.

[Speaker 3]
Sudio... He's gonna run...

[Speaker 1]
If you guys ever have a bonus action left or healing or something like that or movement left over you can always do that stuff. They're not gonna stop you from doing that stuff.

[Speaker 3]
You know what, he's just gonna he can do the jumping stuff, right? He can just jump to the roof and cross. Yeah.

This guy.

[Speaker 5]
Oops, it wasn't supposed to go to her.

[Speaker 1]
How do you out-of-character talk? Oh, I disabled that module. Use your words!

[Speaker 4]
For out-of-character talk you know how you are based you have to release your character and not select them at the same time? Oh, that's too much. Fair enough.

[Speaker 6]
What the fuck? What is all that from?

[Speaker 3]
Interesting. I'll take it. I don't quite believe it, but I'll take it.

Oh, are you hearing things in your brain?

[Speaker 1]
You also have to it doesn't look like it's adding your ability score modifier. Which is... Or any of the other bonuses.

But it has four this creature has four hit points so that will kill it.

[Speaker 3]
I'll have another hit. Um... Can I just move here?

Move here. How much movement does this idiot have? Why does it say he has zero?

What the fuck? Let me go to my other guy.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, because I think you're grappled still.

[Speaker 3]
Am I grappled?

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god, stop double-right-clicking fuck on the screen! Uh, there you go. No longer stuck.

I should be able to move.

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful, wonderful. Can you move this guy out of the way so that I can stand there? Because that's the only place I can go.

[Speaker 6]
Yay!

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm going to attack this guy. And you said that this is not doing my... with the damage?

Or the...

[Speaker 1]
The damage wasn't doing it properly.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, how do I see what that is? What it's supposed to have?

[Speaker 1]
So, go ahead and do... Plus what? Could be plus your dexterity modifier plus your...

plus like a bonus.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so like a plus five.

[Speaker 1]
Plus like the bonus of the weapon, so that should be plus two, so it should be like something plus seven. Plus... I screwed the dice, plus seven.

That's twelve. Nice. And that's on the booyah!

[Speaker 3]
Um, I...

[Speaker 1]
Yes, mark it. Perfect.

[Speaker 3]
I have... Um... Oh, uh...

I can regain sixteen hit points. Or I can gain sixteen temporary hit points. Uh, yeah, that's my go.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Agnes. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I don't think I can... You're a monk, so you can like evade, disengage.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, there we go. Why did it tell me... Is that for when they're already in it?

Anyway, I meant to do that instead. Oh, yes, the attack is... I just didn't separate the thing.

[Speaker 1]
But also, this is one of my favorite spells. Uh, so... This is...

Alright, so... Everybody in there has to make a strength save.

[Speaker 2]
I think Cecilio barely isn't in it.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. And as a bonus action, you can cause a bolt of lightning. That's what the attack is.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, well then, for my bonus action, I'd like to attack with some lightning. Um...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, wait. It has to be sixty feet from the center. So, like...

It doesn't even have to be in the thing. You just get advantage if they're in the thing.

[Speaker 1]
Which is good, because you have disadvantage on attacks against creatures draped in shadow.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I guess I'm gonna lightning bolt the big white troll dude.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the fog... It fails.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Nessie, don't forget to pop it out.

[Speaker 2]
I'll pop what out?

[Speaker 5]
The thing. If you right-click on the chat message before James makes it go away, you can pop it out so you have access to it later in the combat.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Same. Same thing.

I see it, though. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Squad... Okay. But he is going to take fifteen lightning damage for the other four, because he failed.

Alright. Any other movement or anything else like that on your turn while I apply this damage?

[Speaker 2]
No movement. I take it the fireball thing's gonna go away.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yeah. There's no longer a fireball there.

[Speaker 1]
Though there are burning pixie houses.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no. That's why they hate us.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Nowhere really for her to move. I don't wanna...

Um... It won't... It's not what I mean.

Okay. I'll move there. It's her turn.

I don't wanna get too close.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair. Unraveling squad is going to attack the caster.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, what? Have they been subtracting the d6 from...

[Speaker 1]
The ones that... Some of the ones that have failed have not been. Okay.

Go back up. I wish... I'm gonna try to...

After this combat is over, I'm gonna reload and see if I can add Defred's convenient effects back on.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think you can. It's still 1. Or 11.

Whatever.

[Speaker 1]
Dynamic active effects is active again.

[Speaker 5]
Because I just looked at Defred's yesterday or something and it was still not updated.

[Speaker 1]
They need to update that stat. I need that. It was so fucking good to just create an effect.

Any effect. And just apply it.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, you still can, I think. It's just Defred's isn't... Because dynamic effective allows you to make effects.

That's how I made Nox's aura.

[Speaker 1]
So we're gonna apply the minus d6 to these guys. Longbow attack versus Agnes. These guys have free squadron.

They rolled a 1. They missed.

[Speaker 4]
They forgot to knock their bows at all.

[Speaker 1]
I believe it. They can't. It's really hard to see.

This is the problem right now. These guys are going to attack you. Leadership.

[Speaker 3]
Aww. Aww.

[Speaker 2]
Every time you say that I just picture Zef Brannigan from Futurama. Leadership.

[Speaker 3]
Roll your stupid damage.

[Speaker 1]
I will roll my stupid damage. Nice. I like the squadron.

[Speaker 3]
I get half. That's only 19.

[Speaker 1]
Plus another 8. Which is actually poor.

[Speaker 7]
Phoebe's getting fucking bullied right now.

[Speaker 3]
That's okay. She can take it. She's got it all.

I plan to come and give you my aura. I have a potion that I'm gonna drink next. Because I can take many more hits.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sending the hella over. Which is going to take some damage. He's gonna walk on the brimble road.

Now he's gonna attack Sissudio.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
Really shitty roll. That sucks.

[Speaker 6]
7 damage on Sissudio. Alright, Sissudio.

[Speaker 3]
He's got a bunch of temporary hit points. Is there like a max amount of temp hit points that you can get?

[Speaker 1]
No, you just can't stack them.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So that's a yes. Got it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Half the round. Ki-Bee.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on.

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna be Ki-Bee, then Nox, then the Naiad, then Silk, Kaman, Hestia.

[Speaker 8]
I'm at the top. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Ki-Bee. This guy is still alive, right? This little dude?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah. Yes. Apparently I have disadvantage to attack him.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. That sucks. Can I reckless and turn it into a normal?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can. That hits. That also hits.

That first hit might kill him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh? Then we'll just put it over to these people.

[Speaker 1]
9.2 to hit. There's nothing that's gonna help him there, I don't think. I think he's just toast.

[Speaker 3]
The 19 will go to this guy. Or these guys. And...

I don't suppose that...

[Speaker 1]
What was the roll to hit? Oh, it was the 19 to hit. That will miss.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
You can use the Bardic Inspiration.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay, so that's a D what?

[Speaker 4]
It's a D10. Last I checked.

[Speaker 3]
Slash roll. D10. Alright.

I don't think it hits. Damn it.

[Speaker 1]
You missed by one.

[Speaker 6]
Oh well.

[Speaker 1]
Anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Uh... No, because I'm an idiot and didn't pick my potion instead of hitting.

But, you know, that's fine. That's pretty on-brand.

[Speaker 1]
But you do still have a bonus action, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah? I just don't know what to do with it.

[Speaker 1]
If you think of something, you can use it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! I can action surge to take a potion, right?

[Speaker 1]
You can take a potion as a bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, can you? I won't argue with that. Uh...

I got two of these.

[Speaker 1]
Seems good, because Nox just went AFK at the worst time possible. Which is fine, because I'm guessing it's something to do with kids.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, he drank her potion.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and are you action surging? No. So it would be Nox.

I'm just going to have Silk go first. She did just say she's back. Oh, alright.

Nox.

[Speaker 3]
Oh shit, this guy moved closer.

[Speaker 1]
I really like the effect of the fairy light going over the high contrast.

[Speaker 3]
It blinds me.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, everybody all allies within ten feet of Nox. It gets my auras and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
What would Nox like to do for his action?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to hit. I'm just showing the stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're good. Go ahead and roll your attack first, because I think that stuff is actually applied automatically.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Is this big, ugly cat creature alive? Okay.

No, Phoebe is not ugly. She's adorable and fierce.

[Speaker 5]
And no, some of that stuff is not automatic, because I made it. And I couldn't figure out how to make it happen.

[Speaker 1]
It's tricky, because for some reason it says it depends on whether or not a creature is friendly.

[Speaker 2]
It is showing that they do have it on there, so at least that's something.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's just showing who has it. I think the big problem that I had was I didn't know the coding portion of it.

[Speaker 1]
Right, the attribute.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And I couldn't find any.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, both of those hit. Jesus. Oh, you have disadvantage on these tasks because he is draped in shadow.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
So can Knox just not see him, then?

[Speaker 1]
It's not that you can't see him, no. It's just disadvantage on these. That's the effect.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, then I'll roll an attack again.

[Speaker 1]
Still hit. Still hit, yes. Alright, cool.

Yeah, no, he's toast. Alright, anything for your bonus action? Movement.

[Speaker 2]
He already moved. I think that's it Yeah, that'll be it.

[Speaker 1]
So how does it look? Can you guys see the gloom light, or is that only when you're not selected on your character?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we can see it even when not selected. It might click on your character. Should I have the green?

Should I send a screenshot?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, send a screenshot. No, no, no, it's not the green, it's like the black.

[Speaker 5]
I can see it, but I wonder if it has to do with whether or not you have darkvision.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I'm guessing.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm. Is the bolt launcher the big threat here? Or is there another guy that's a big threat?

This guy. The biggest threat is probably the Oathbreaker. Okay.

Do I have a clear shot at him? You have disadvantage on all targets within the shadows. Okay.

I do have... I guess I just have invisibility on the scope. Won't necessarily pierce the darkness.

If I have disadvantage, that means I can't apply sneak attack to anyone outside the shadows. Hobgoblin Captain, I guess. Yeah.

Can I shoot this guy from where I am?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. That guy is still in it, though.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, he is. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you click on Holoth, it might show you the... or if you just click outside... Oh, I see.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Uh...

Alright. No sneak attack contribution. I guess I'll just make a...

Uh... I'll steady aim. I'll just shoot at this guy with a regular shot.

No sneak attack. Oh, but I can have Holoth use the 21-gun salute thing. Uh...

I have to remind myself... Oh. Only if the target had advantage, it's a critical.

Never mind. Not worth doing. Just a regular attack, then.

[Speaker 1]
Hits. And who are you attacking? Ah, Holoth.

Still a shit-ton of damage.

[Speaker 8]
Decent job. Uh... And...

that's it. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 4]
So, just need to get rid of that Oathbreaker dude, because he seems like a problem.

[Speaker 2]
Are these guys... They take damage each time their turn ends in my sphere.

[Speaker 1]
I applied the damage at the beginning, but...

[Speaker 2]
Okay, okay. I'm just making sure that that's still happening.

[Speaker 6]
Right, let me...

[Speaker 4]
Let me roll the damage for that. And then I'll give a little bit of inspiration to our local warlock Hestia. Oh, thank the stars.

Alright. Well, he's in... Oh, wait!

And the extra 1d6 because of Kibi's sword. So... 26 bits of damage and is incapacitated.

Hestia, you get... You get Bardic Inspiration. And Cameron gives an award-winning smile.

What does your Bardic Inspiration do? Can I use it on spells and stuff? Yes, you can.

So what you can do is you can add it to any ability checks, saving throws, and if you do a spell that does damage or healing, you can add it to the damage or healing thing. Yokey-dokey, that's what I want. And it's a d10.

So I'll just move a little away. Nope. Yeah, I'll move a little away.

No, there's really nowhere to move. I'll just move back a bit.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Still continues. Okay. Alright, so he's incapacitated.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, hello. Oh, wow. Whatcha doin'?

Would you like a little ca- Oh, that's what fell.

[Speaker 3]
I need caffeine.

[Speaker 5]
What? Same. Same.

[Speaker 7]
Get yourself a local caffeine injection today.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm, I wish.

[Speaker 4]
Can't take actions or reactions.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that was giving Hestia the bardic inspiration.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, brings us to Hestia.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, um... Oh, gosh. Hey, Augie?

I need my keyboard again. Thank you, puppy. Gosh, he's incapacitated.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on a second. No, he's not. What's this?

[Speaker 4]
Leisure ship.

[Speaker 1]
Ah.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I can't counter that.

[Speaker 1]
Into a...

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, I'll go with my original plan, then.

[Speaker 6]
Fair. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
And then that is 1d10, correct? Yep. Awesome possum.

And then I'm going to fly over here and I'm going to use my healing light bonus action that just consumes a usage that didn't do anything for me. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Boop, boop.

[Speaker 5]
There we go. I gained myself some healing.

[Speaker 1]
Into the Hound Goblin squad. Nessie, can you ping that again?

[Speaker 6]
Uh... Yeah?

[Speaker 2]
Is that something I'm supposed to be able to do in the pop-out, or do I just need to...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you would have to just recast and then just hit the do not use... do not consume usage button.

[Speaker 6]
Boop, boop, boop.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Ends its turn there.

[Speaker 2]
Hurting all the bad guys towards you guys.

[Speaker 1]
Now they have to worry about it.

[Speaker 6]
Buddy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. These guys are going to attack Nox with their longswords. Roll to 1.

That's their turn. Okay, Hound Goblin captain. Wait, no, no, no.

Alright, so that's how I marked them defeated and dead with, like, the skull over them instead of, like, the... I don't even know why that's an option to, like, not have, like, the skull just over their fucking thing that's... Alright.

I think I'm just going to move over here and I'm just going to reuse that roll. Could take damage from the brambles, but it's okay. Let's get in and attack.

[Speaker 7]
It's my turn, bitch.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Attack and attack. Misses. Alright, cool.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, and I get to give advantage to someone's next attack roll, I think. Silk, next attack you make is with advantage.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to move up and just take a touch twice versus the squad. Wait, no, it's straight roll because they're in shadow. Still hits.

Miss.

[Speaker 7]
Down to three in the squad.

[Speaker 1]
This squad, in the meantime, is going to attack Nott as well. They rolled a one. This is the last one.

Alright, that's us.

[Speaker 6]
The earth workers are going to move forward. Two. Alright, we're going to start off with the monk.

[Speaker 1]
That's my multi-attack.

[Speaker 6]
Three, yes. Very good.

[Speaker 1]
I need you, well, actually, it's if I hit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that hits.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Sesudio, make me a constitution save.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no. Sesudio, you are paralyzed.

[Speaker 3]
Can he be paralyzed? Probably. Probably.

[Speaker 2]
You should, are you doing that with advantage? You also get a plus three. Yeah, you're saving throws.

[Speaker 3]
I have to do that with advantage?

[Speaker 2]
Sometimes you do not.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Then let me.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Let me look. Stealth from damage.

Well, you still get a plus three.

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't matter. Oh no.

[Speaker 4]
What's Sesudio's AC?

[Speaker 3]
Eighteen.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Nevermind. That roll is too high for any subtractions to do anything.

[Speaker 1]
It's not like he can die. Okay. Not next to any allies, so I can't do martial advantage, that sucks.

Also going to advance me. Let's do it at third level.

[Speaker 3]
Are you doing this just to Sesudio?

[Speaker 1]
This'll be just to Sesudio.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Again, it's not like he can die.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, he's paralyzed. I'm just going to save that for the second hit. I'm an idiot.

[Speaker 6]
No, you're not.

[Speaker 1]
Did you apply your damage to the eighteen?

[Speaker 3]
Eighteen. Apply damage.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, now. Let me attack roll. Hits.

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 6]
He doesn't. Question.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, oh no. Nevermind.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, Sesudio.

[Speaker 3]
I think he's still kicking. No, he's not, he's paralyzed. He can't kick anything.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, that's wrong. Ignore that. Jesus.

Why is the Corvula so fucked up for Divine Smite? It's not a sporty. Eighty-eight.

[Speaker 7]
No, it's not fucked up, because that was a critical.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's the thirty.

[Speaker 7]
Ow.

[Speaker 1]
You alive there, little bro? And then I'm going to attack with your third attack.

[Speaker 2]
If you survive until it's Nox's turn, I can help you.

[Speaker 3]
It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
He'll come back to one health point.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Thirty-four.

[Speaker 3]
Do your worst.

[Speaker 2]
Is this slashing?

[Speaker 7]
Fourteen.

[Speaker 3]
Slashing damage?

[Speaker 1]
Eleven slashing, three radiant. And then another Wait, no, not parry.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just doing half damage. I can't calculate all that.

[Speaker 1]
Just take Just take away an additional one. Once you're finished. Okay.

Oh, here it is.

[Speaker 3]
Eighty... If it'll fucking let me. Eighty-one.

[Speaker 1]
And then... You can have again. Eighty-one.

[Speaker 3]
Why is it doing this? Eighty-one, you cunk. Alright, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Then the Ogre Bolt Launcher has to have him, like, step over.

[Speaker 8]
Nope.

[Speaker 1]
Awww. Point two to hit. Four...

Nine damage. That was a really shitty roll. Hit me!

It's his turn. The Naiad.

[Speaker 8]
Fucking hey. Did you already apply the damage or should I? You can go ahead and apply the damage, I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
Miss Riddles. I hit Riddles.

[Speaker 7]
Yes! Finally hit me.

[Speaker 1]
Twelve psychic damage. Is that Naiad's turn?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 1]
They're gonna split their attacks here. Six. And a critical versus the squad.

Nineteen. Jesus.

[Speaker 8]
They're down to two dudes now. I can't apply the damage. What the hell?

You took the six, right? There you go. Okay, I went through.

Yeah, thanks. I was, like, right-clicking on the message and I couldn't get the menu to pop up.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Rinaldo.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Is this big guy still alive?

[Speaker 1]
I'm getting a lot of audio feedback.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sorry. Sorry, Augie went right under my mic and started cleaning himself.

[Speaker 1]
The Ogre Hounda is not still alive.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Oh, these guys up here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Say that, guys.

[Speaker 7]
You can't walk through an enemy.

[Speaker 1]
You have to go around.

[Speaker 2]
It's rude.

[Speaker 7]
I'll probably take an attack of opportunity here, actually.

[Speaker 6]
Indeed.

[Speaker 2]
You could've done it in such a way where you don't get...

[Speaker 7]
Alright. Hit me with your attack of opportunity.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and roll your shit while you're doing that.

[Speaker 7]
Alright. Just make sure this hits first. Does an 18 hit?

[Speaker 1]
Your damage? Yes, it does.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Roll your damage.

[Speaker 6]
Okay! Okay!

[Speaker 1]
Fuck Blood Vessel. Dead.

[Speaker 7]
Already?

[Speaker 1]
Mark him defeated. Thank you. Wow.

Nice. Alright, you still have one attack.

[Speaker 7]
Yes. 21 damage before you get on my ass.

[Speaker 1]
The damage of this...

[Speaker 7]
What?

[Speaker 1]
21 to hit, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. 1d6 lightning. That's...

Okay. Apparently I'm selected. Whatever.

Whatever. Fuck ever. Divine Smite at second level.

There we go. Oh. I had myself selected.

There. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
He is also now dead. Perfect. Okay.

After that, we have Susubigo.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, how do I get rid of paralyzing?

[Speaker 1]
I... don't think... You have to wait until the beginning of his next turn, I believe.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. And he'll just, um...

[Speaker 1]
Somebody could also cast Lesser Restoration.

[Speaker 3]
He's moaning groan on the floor, I guess. Yeah, I'll just say, if he...

[Speaker 2]
Nox has Lesser Restoration, so if you can survive... Okay. I will try.

[Speaker 1]
There's also Cleansing Touch, which some paladins have, but it's a level dependent thing. All right. Agnes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. Mine?

[Speaker 8]
I have to hop out to a meeting. Okay. I authorize anyone and anyone to play Silk.

Good people. Real good.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 2]
Mine's still further forward. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Plus two bonus.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, damn it!

[Speaker 7]
I do make it.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Well, that sucks. Um...

[Speaker 7]
Again.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Let's hope that...

[Speaker 6]
I... Fuck.

[Speaker 2]
That's amazing. Oh, that's unfortunate. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt that group.

[Speaker 1]
By the way, the Lightning doesn't, um... The Lightning doesn't interfere with, like, casting two spells in a turn.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because it's a bonus action.

[Speaker 1]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Does an 18 hit them?

[Speaker 1]
18 does hit.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, dammit!

[Speaker 1]
Just the... They don't take the 2d6. Wow.

But they do take the 14 Lightning damage.

[Speaker 6]
Goddamn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And then, um...

[Speaker 1]
It's down to one dude.

[Speaker 2]
That is all she can do.

[Speaker 1]
Temporary.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wait! I... They get extra damage because I have done a dragon thing.

Dragon? They get this thing. Right?

Because it's chromatic. Is that extra damage?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. You get a bonus equal to the number rolled to one of the spell's damage rolls. Yeah, so add another d6.

Woo!

[Speaker 2]
There.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Now she's done.

[Speaker 1]
These guys, they're gonna take damage either way.

[Speaker 2]
It's also difficult to raid.

[Speaker 1]
Jump over here. Go to the floor. But we'll get back in a moment.

They are going to shoot across at Grenold.

[Speaker 7]
You have 22 to hit.

[Speaker 1]
Unless I never use my Taladin's bonus action. I should do that next time. Plus four.

[Speaker 7]
Just hits.

[Speaker 6]
32 total. How? And they take their 2d5 damage.

[Speaker 1]
And they get Bramble Road. We have the Hobgoblin squad next. Over here, which is not feeling so great.

It's just the... It's just the one dude. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I'm down, though.

[Speaker 1]
He's fucked. He's not doing so hot. He's just gonna attack Peevee.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, what about this guy?

[Speaker 1]
That's him. It's all just him. And also Morphling.

[Speaker 2]
He came around and did a U-shape and killed everybody except for him.

[Speaker 6]
Who's attacking? Peevee?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. I got 9 and then 10 damage.

[Speaker 3]
9 and then 10. Alright, cool.

[Speaker 1]
It is top of the round. Peevee!

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm assuming this hit is gonna kill him and then the next hit is gonna go to this guy. You know which guy I'm talking about.

Do I get an advantage or am I still at disadvantage?

[Speaker 1]
Still at disadvantage.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. So that's a 14 damage on this guy. Does that kill him?

[Speaker 6]
He's still up.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. And a 19.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
You know what, now I'm gonna action search because I would like to request that we long rest after this.

[Speaker 7]
Assuming we get to long rest.

[Speaker 3]
I really want to. I don't like this guy. What's that?

Ow. Ow. Not even at advantage.

Jesus.

[Speaker 6]
Good for you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah. Only 1 and a 13. Fuck this guy.

Oh my god. Okay. That didn't do much.

[Speaker 1]
I'm starting to scratch him up a little bit.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I think I have a bonus action. Bonus action. Um.

Hug it. This is a thing I can do. Alright.

There we go. Done.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. That brings us to Nox.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Studio. Might not be worth it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, but.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well what do you want? Do you want me to not do it then?

[Speaker 3]
You know what? Do it. Alright.

Somewhere in there.

[Speaker 2]
I think the Google Hub said I was talking to it. He is not paralyzed anymore.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
He can stop being dramatic on the floor now.

[Speaker 1]
Nox also has a bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
Yes he does.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see. The abbreviated bonus action. That's so stupid.

[Speaker 5]
It's not abbreviated on the old sheet.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, but the old sheet is hard for me to look at. Otherwise, I would do it. Um.

That's concentration. That's concent- Uh oh. Nope, he's done.

Everything else is con- Wait, no, he's not concentrating anything. That's Agnes. Nevermind.

Um. We'll do... We'll do that.

So, that's what he's doing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Here is going to attack some. So is.

Common, go ahead and take your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Just a quick question. How many goblins are left, like in total?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, all the ones that don't have a death thing on them.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. You misunderstand. I want to cast Mass Suggestion, which has a limited amount of people it can cast on.

[Speaker 1]
Right, but that's still... I would just go ahead and count those. So there's the Hobgoblin squad on top.

That's four of them left. Um. There's two squads with four Hobgoblins.

There's the... There's a squad with three Hobgoblins left. And then there's the Warlord.

[Speaker 4]
Eleven. Okay. I could get all of them with this.

Cool. Let's hope it works then. That would be all twelve.

Thanks to our dear Kibi, it's at the seventh level.

[Speaker 1]
Those guys are also within thirty feet. Ah, but they would still fail. And they still fail.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, for the Oathbreaker, I want to use my Minstrel Dice on him.

[Speaker 6]
Slash roll... Forty... Eight.

Which should make him fail. One... Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
And there was a set of Goblins that also succeeded?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, there was one Hobgoblin squad that succeeded.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, cool. Let me just make them also fail.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. They also now fail.

[Speaker 6]
Sweet.

[Speaker 4]
Now, uh, I guess the general command would be, uh, protect us? Like, protect me and my companions.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that would as far as I'm concerned, end this particular combat.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah! Yippee!

[Speaker 1]
Be here for a farewell. Fade after one minute.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, cool, cool.

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna take a ten minute break.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna get a ten minute nap then.

[Speaker 6]
Ten minute nap.

[Speaker 1]
Enjoy! Why is this so... Oh, does not taste good.

[Speaker 3]
You know what? I could totally order some coffee.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what's going on here.

[Speaker 2]
I know, I'm... I already had coffee today, and I might just...

[Speaker 5]
I would go with... I would have to go with my dad.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, that'd be more than a minute.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, it's only like five minutes of coffee.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, that's true.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to get myself a cup of water. Catch you in the later!

[Speaker 6]
Why do I have an effect from the Hobgoblin Warlord?

[Speaker 5]
What?

[Speaker 6]
Oh. I have an effect from the Hobgoblin Warlord. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
He's giving me a bonus. To my attack.

[Speaker 6]
That's really cute.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'm gonna...

[Speaker 2]
You are cutting in and out, lady.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I know. I had to turn down my sensitivity. Because it keeps like picking up.

I think now that my... I think now that I don't have my AC going, it's like more sensitive. So if I mutter, you're not going to hear me.

[Speaker 2]
Actively, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because it's not actively screaming and getting filtered.

[Speaker 3]
Guys, I need help.

[Speaker 6]
What's up?

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I don't know what to order. I don't know much about coffee, but I really want coffee. They have a campfire mocha, a berry white mocha, a vanilla white mocha, and a latte.

What the fuck is a latte?

[Speaker 6]
Hot milk.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I want coffee, though.

[Speaker 2]
It's like shots of coffee with hot milk.

[Speaker 5]
It has coffee, just a small amount. It has espresso.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's just two... I want to say two shots of espresso with hot milk. It might be one shot.

Um... What's the campfire one?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Real chocolate melted into steamed milk and combined with rich espresso and toasted marshmallow flavor. Topped with whipped cream, mini marshmallows, and chocolate.

This shit's too fancy for me. I just want coffee. Okay, and then there was the berry one.

Yeah, that one looks interesting. Um... It's...

rich chocolate melted into steamed milk combined with rich espresso and raspberry flavored. Popped with whipped cream and ice... whipped cream and chocolate chips.

[Speaker 2]
It sounds like, if you don't want anything that fancy, either the latte or the... just the vanilla one. I go with the vanilla one.

That's the third option. That sounds like it's going to be flavored but it's not over the top. They also just have hot crafted press.

[Speaker 3]
I might just get that.

[Speaker 2]
That's cheaper. That's wonderful. You also could just get that and then dress it yourself at home.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I'm going to get the cheap one. Yeah.

I don't want no fancy shit. Oh, you can actually add things. I'll just get a basic bitch.

[Speaker 6]
Enjoy. I will.

[Speaker 3]
I can't wait. Do we get it now?

[Speaker 1]
I can give it to you guys now. You're not in any immediate danger but you are still in relative danger.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[Speaker 7]
Someone's behind my door. Yes, I hear you. I'm coming.

[Speaker 4]
James, do you still have the link to the magic weapon rolling thing? I think I misplaced the PDF.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you look for ADDDMG anywhere basically if you just look for DMG on the server you'll find it. Thanks.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Do that real quick.

[Speaker 1]
I'll do has file and then I'm surprised I don't have anything pinned.

[Speaker 3]
This has nothing to do with anything but I wanted to show you a cute picture of the dogs that I just got done pet sitting.

[Speaker 6]
I would love to see that.

[Speaker 3]
This one in particular. She was my favorite.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
She's absolutely precious.

[Speaker 4]
10 out of 10.

[Speaker 6]
Right?

[Speaker 3]
She's the best personality. There were four of them and I think she's definitely my favorite. I do play favorites.

I don't play the favorite. I pet them all and love them all equally but I definitely have favorites.

[Speaker 6]
I understand.

[Speaker 1]
I can distribute awards which is cool but it doesn't show me all of the primary spline characters assigned to players instead.

[Speaker 6]
It doesn't show me all of the players. Not biting me. I don't want to cuddle.

Come on. Hey, stop it.

[Speaker 1]
And how many characters do we have?

[Speaker 6]
Eight. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

[Speaker 3]
7, 8.

[Speaker 1]
1, 2, 3, 4. Wait.

[Speaker 3]
Is this a dude?

[Speaker 1]
No, he's a higher link. Two from Nessie, one from Mother, one from Heart, and one from Phineas. You guys immediately will get 1,425 XP.

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 1]
1,425.

[Speaker 3]
You're gonna put that somewhere? Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Stop it.

[Speaker 7]
My cat's bullying me.

[Speaker 2]
Cat duty.

[Speaker 1]
And who are we baiting on? I do not know. Who's back?

[Speaker 7]
So everyone's here. Excellent.

[Speaker 1]
Let me know everybody applies that XP that I just put in the chat.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Yep. I'm doing it to Kibi now.

[Speaker 6]
I already did it. Yes, there is a version 12. Agnes leveled up?

Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, hey. Congratulations.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's done.

[Speaker 6]
Ow!

[Speaker 4]
Your cat still bullying you?

[Speaker 7]
He always does.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, he's so defeated.

[Speaker 7]
If I ignore her, she bites me.

[Speaker 3]
If I give her attention, she still bites me.

[Speaker 7]
I love cats. Cats are your endgame bosses. You don't understand.

[Speaker 3]
I love them so much. I befriended the outside cat where I just got done pet sitting. It took me a couple of days, but I finally did.

[Speaker 1]
Red, stop. What are you doing?

[Speaker 7]
I'm getting bit.

[Speaker 3]
Lock the cat outside of your room.

[Speaker 7]
Great idea.

[Speaker 3]
He or she might scream a lot, but it's better than getting bitten.

[Speaker 6]
Come here.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, now she gives me kisses. That's crazy. Yeah, I caught you now.

Off we go. It's funny, they shift their personality the second you catch them.

[Speaker 4]
Such is life.

[Speaker 1]
Has everybody applied the XP to their character sheets?

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to return to setup, which is going to temporarily disconnect you folks. I'm also going to apply XP to...

[Speaker 6]
I'll let him have the total once everything is set. Yes, Deepthread's convenient effects actually did get a... apparently did have an update a while ago.

There's also Deepthread's effects panel. That's interesting. Actually pretty cool.

[Speaker 1]
The effects panel for version 12 updated two months ago, but convenient effects apparently updated yesterday.

[Speaker 6]
Sweet. Update all my modules. Why do I have French Pathfinder 2nd edition module?

Did you accidentally download it? Like in a box set or something, maybe. I'm going to remove it.

Also, probably going to get rid of Warpgate. I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, as far as I know, Warpgate just doesn't exist anymore.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it no longer has a proper manifest link. Updating JB2A or DP5A. Yeah, the person who made it can't maintain it anymore.

I think they had to delete it because there was some weird shit going on with it. Very true. Okay, I'm relaunching the world.

And everybody should be able to log back in now. I've been through a desert on a horse with no name. You know, this is having a crisis.

And she thought that me doing that was talking to her. She got really mad at me. Wait, were you talking to her when she was saying that she didn't want to talk?

[Speaker 2]
No, I was, but when I started singing horse with no name, she kind of yelled at me. But because she didn't want me to talk to her, I couldn't be like, I'm not talking to you.

[Speaker 3]
Who is this that we're talking about?

[Speaker 2]
My oldest, my four-year-old. She's almost five. She's in a hungry and tired spot.

All she wants is a Popsicle, but she needs to have lunch before she gets a Popsicle, so she's mad. She doesn't know what she wants to eat, because all she wants is a Popsicle. So she's just laying on the kitchen floor, kind of opening the food and letting it.

And going like, I want to pick, but she doesn't know what she wants to pick. So she's... Poor girl.

She really just needs an NAP, but...

[Speaker 6]
I know that feeling. Just opening the fridge, being like, there's nothing in here, closing it again.

[Speaker 5]
As though there will be something new.

[Speaker 3]
Trying to see if your standards have lowered yet.

[Speaker 2]
She opened it, and she's opening it, and then she's slamming it shut and going, no! Like, really? What'd you say?

[Speaker 3]
Oh. What'd you say, Fragasa? Oh, I said it's worse when you're a stoner.

[Speaker 6]
I bet.

[Speaker 2]
She's now getting in a fight with the door, because it keeps closing on her. I don't want her to see me laughing, though, because it's going to make her mad. Rightfully so.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. One more time. See what happens.

[Speaker 1]
Aha, it works again. Nice. Alright, folks, what are you doing next?

[Speaker 2]
Is Hestia's bridge still up?

[Speaker 1]
It is.

[Speaker 6]
Um, I don't think it goes away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I mean, we can all, I mean, unless we want to search the Fairy City, we could probably just use that to get out.

[Speaker 7]
Is Reynald unconscious?

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Does Reynald need healing?

[Speaker 7]
He does.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Is this him?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Nox can heal you.

[Speaker 4]
Are you doing it by spell or by feature?

[Speaker 2]
I was figuring by feature.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, then.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, you're unconscious. I mean, the most I can give you is lay on hands.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I have a fifth level cure wounds that I was going to cast on Susudio, but if someone's down, I can cast them instead, and then maybe you can heal Susudio.

[Speaker 2]
Are we going to try and take a long rest after this?

[Speaker 3]
I would like to, because I have two rages left.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, um, does everybody else want to try to take a long rest?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Let's go to the entrance. Oh, man, we could just, like, hunker down. We'll find a house, one of these Pixie houses, or are they too small?

No, they're way too small. Yeah, we can, we can...

[Speaker 5]
I think we're also still, like, in a hostile territory.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're, we need to get out of the little fairy place, so we need to either...

[Speaker 3]
Um... I'm gonna put something in chat really quickly, ignore it. So there's that rage, and then there's this rage.

Is there absolutely any difference? No, there is not. There's two of them, I need to delete one.

Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Delete the second one that you click.

[Speaker 4]
What's our general goal past here? What are we aiming to do? There's a demon at the end of this that we're trying to kill.

Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so... Maybe we want to backtrack to, like, the entrance to do a long rest?

[Speaker 3]
See, that's what I was thinking.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, right. I mean, if we find an area that's not, um... Pixie-hutted...

Hold on, how long does tiny hut last for?

[Speaker 6]
Uh...

[Speaker 4]
Eight hours, doesn't it? Oh, there we go, eight hours, which is the full long rest time.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, we can just... We'll go back to the beginning here.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, there's the room over... That's... I just don't think the entrance is the greatest spot, because that's where that, um...

Hippobigriff...

[Speaker 3]
We could make camp outside, then.

[Speaker 5]
That thing? No, it was a chimera.

[Speaker 3]
We should make camp outside, then. I don't trust this place. Kibi doesn't.

[Speaker 1]
Outside isn't necessarily any safer. Uh... I mean, we can...

[Speaker 5]
I'm thinking over here, because this is where those two pixies and wolfies were, um...

[Speaker 3]
Is the place still on fire? Can we put out the fire before we do anything?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, um... Who are you cure-wounding?

[Speaker 5]
The guy who's down.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Who's down? I will give Susudio hit points.

[Speaker 4]
Before you do that, I'll give you another bardic inspiration, so you can add that to your healing. So, yeah, just another d10 of healing. So right now, it's 35 in total.

Congratulations.

[Speaker 2]
Susudio, you get 45 hit points.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. 14 plus 45 is 59! You should see me trying to play this fucking game in person.

[Speaker 2]
If I had to play in person, I'd have so many cards and tips and tricks and sticky notes and reminders.

[Speaker 3]
I just have a calculator and the sheets that the DM passed out for this.

[Speaker 2]
Everything would be highlighted and in bold, and it'd be like use this!

[Speaker 4]
It'd be in 72 print font. A lot of people actually still need a bit of healing. I do have healing ward as well, and since we're taking a long rest, I'd get my slots back, so...

How much is everyone hurting as of far?

[Speaker 2]
Agnes is just over half health, but if we're gonna find a place to long rest, then I think we should be good.

[Speaker 6]
We're in half HP too?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we heal back full points on a long rest while we're traveling.

[Speaker 3]
No, you have to use your hit points. Yeah, hit dice.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's why I was asking if anyone needed spell wise, since at least I'd get my spells back.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Kiwi's gonna be trying to... Do I have anything to... I have a pot in my mess kit.

I have a pot in my mess kit, so I'm gonna be trying to dump water on the fire. Cheese is right here. The cheese is right here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. Kiwi, does your extra leveling up for bards still apply or has that worn off by now?

[Speaker 1]
I... I don't know. Yeah, it's mid-combat.

It's worn off.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that makes sense. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
So, how much fire is there? Am I able to put it all out?

[Speaker 6]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you'll be able to put it out. Okay. You've got 40 minutes to do so.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, then we can go to the entrance and... or somewhere. We need to go somewhere.

Kiwi's gonna... I'm gonna go somewhere.

[Speaker 1]
You guys begin moving. Go ahead and move your tokens.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm moving because we have to do something. Let's find... Let's do this room.

This room? Alright. Come on.

[Speaker 4]
This one? Do the pixies say anything as we move by?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they're a little perturbed at the hobgoblins you have following you. What's the meaning of this?

[Speaker 4]
Hobgoblins? Oh, we uh... Yeah, I couldn't remember.

Mass suggestion. Um, we should probably explain how they are under a spell. So they're chill.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be right back. My coffee's here.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yay.

[Speaker 7]
Well, that's going on there.

[Speaker 4]
I'll explain to the pixies that I have them under control for now. I won't have them for now. I have them under control.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and roll me a persuasion check.

[Speaker 2]
I was just gonna say, Nox would say I will lay in between you and the horde if that makes you feel better.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, don't fail me now, persuasion. Yeah, right, we good.

[Speaker 1]
Well, as long as they're out, we don't know when the next attack will come. Sorry, I... Did you...

[Speaker 4]
Did they say anything past as long as they're out?

[Speaker 1]
As long as they're out, we don't know when the next attack will come, is what they said.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, thank you. Uh, yeah. Well, we'll try to make...

We'll protect you if the next attack comes, and if not, we'll be able to... Sorry, yes, it's just that we'll protect you if another attack comes. Rightio.

Giving Agnes a bit of healing. How does 24 feel?

[Speaker 2]
So much better than the 5 that Nox healed her.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I'm back. What's going on? Um, I'm dashing out a bit of healing.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Before we take our, uh, nap.

[Speaker 2]
It almost has her at full health. That's awesome.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, cool. Uh, let's see. Other people, like Hestia also needs healing, so...

[Speaker 1]
Rightio. Move your characters to wherever it is you are nesting. Or resting.

[Speaker 2]
Are we resting in this room?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Nox is gonna sleep between the this room and...

[Speaker 3]
Where is everyone? Are you in that? Are you...

Okay, you're in there. I'm resting in here. Oh, I thought that was where the Chimera dug through.

[Speaker 2]
It is. We just ran that thing out. We didn't kill it.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe we should move back in here?

[Speaker 2]
That's where most of us are.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... Alright.

Yeah. I think that's a good idea. Shut the door on your way out, and I'm sure we'll be fine.

I think there's, uh... There's all these weirdos in here, and then there's our pallet in here. So, um...

Our pallet needs to come in. And we can just kind of keep these mass-adjusted people in the room where the Chimera comes from. Ooh, that's a good idea.

Then that will be our alarm system. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, they're staying by you.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay. I'm just going to sleep by a bunch of weirdos. Who's got first watch?

[Speaker 3]
PB.

[Speaker 4]
Before you go on first watch, you get 11 HP.

[Speaker 1]
Whoever is on watch is allowed to keep their armor on. Everybody else, you're not going to get restful sleep if you're going to have your armor on.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi doesn't need armor.

[Speaker 6]
Exactly.

[Speaker 7]
My armor's incorporated into my body.

[Speaker 1]
We're forged.

[Speaker 7]
Here, Kibi, have some extra hit points for first watch.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, god. Okay. How much is that?

[Speaker 7]
Five max hit points for eight hours. It's not a lot, but hopefully it helps.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know how to do that. How do I give myself five extra...

[Speaker 7]
You could probably just mark them as temporary hit points, because that's basically what they are. They just don't count as it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Tiny hut.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I have...

[Speaker 7]
Actually, no, I don't have that. And if I'm allowed, so I have ten minutes, I'd like to summon an elk to just keep watch with Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, she gets an animal companion.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, you get support animal companion.

[Speaker 6]
Hopefully that helps you.

[Speaker 3]
So do I do a perception roll, then?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may.

[Speaker 3]
Infinity. She also has, I think, some kind of alert thing.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing appears on your watch.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. That's disappointing.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, and Kibi, I can actually watch with you, because of my sentry's rest feature.

[Speaker 3]
Second watch.

[Speaker 7]
Anybody doing an additional watch?

[Speaker 2]
Knox would. I think that is the only way we're getting through.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Knox, go ahead and make a... Well, you don't need to, because there's no elk there. Watch.

Also no encounter. Actually, Knox, go ahead and make me a perception check anyways.

[Speaker 2]
Everything's fine.

[Speaker 1]
You don't notice the Bone Knoller's sword start moving of its own accord. And slash the Bone Knoller's palm.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, guys.

[Speaker 1]
Means you also don't notice. Nobody apply your resting bonuses. I'm gonna need everybody to start making me saving throws.

[Speaker 6]
Fuck!

[Speaker 2]
Not that.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck.

[Speaker 2]
Where's Agnes? Agnes is under someone.

[Speaker 1]
Did you lose Agnes?

[Speaker 2]
Agnes is under some token. I don't know where she is.

[Speaker 3]
What's the DC?

[Speaker 5]
She's under this one.

[Speaker 1]
If you click it in the chat, you'll get the... It's DC 17.

[Speaker 4]
Click it in here. Okay, she's in here.

[Speaker 3]
Does this count as natural terrain?

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is 27 damage to those of you who rolled below a 17. Below a 17.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Stupid.

[Speaker 1]
And half for those of you who succeeded.

[Speaker 7]
Where's my spine?

[Speaker 3]
With the aura, do we get do we get advantage on that? You get a plus 3 on check. Oh, okay.

15, 16, 17, 18. Okay, I only take half. Oh, a plus 3?

Okay. I don't know why I did that twice.

[Speaker 2]
I clicked it twice. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Time to use my last rage.

[Speaker 2]
Aww, Agnes rolled with an advantage and still got a 7.

[Speaker 1]
First round, they're all going to be surprised.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think Kibi can be.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi might not be able to be surprised.

[Speaker 3]
What would that be under?

[Speaker 1]
Look for... It's going to be a specific effect.

[Speaker 3]
Dangerous.

[Speaker 7]
It's a 7th level feature. I think it's called, like, instinctive pounce or something.

[Speaker 3]
No, that's not what instinctual pounce...

[Speaker 1]
Could we have at least had the effects of a short rest?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, it's feral instinct.

[Speaker 1]
Think if it's interrupted? I don't think so. Because back when we first had a campaign with slow natural healing, what we did every single time I think, was do a short rest before the long rest.

Obviously that made it take an extra hour, but we always did that to get her shit back beforehand.

[Speaker 3]
Keep that in mind.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, comments. You were surprised and then unsurprised. Hestia, surprised and then unsurprised.

Nox, Rinald... Adi-Adi-Ada. To Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, she's going to rage because that's what is required of her. Um... What do I hit?

What am I hitting? Do I see what I'm hitting?

[Speaker 5]
Probably the guy that attacked us.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, the Bonar sword slashed him. He's no longer safe to actually protect. He is now obviously harmful.

[Speaker 3]
This guy?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, alright.

[Speaker 1]
If you hover over him, you should see Bonar's oathbreaker.

[Speaker 3]
This guy's getting hit. He's made me angry.

[Speaker 6]
Kibi's mad. What's that?

[Speaker 1]
Apostrophe.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi smashed. Kibi's an animal. Animal-like creature, I should say.

[Speaker 1]
Does Kibi? No. The elk does, though.

[Speaker 2]
The elk?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, the elk.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Okay. So that's...

[Speaker 1]
If Rinald puts the elk on the board, then you have an Oh, okay, and uh, deal like creeps it's attacks and stuff like that.

[Speaker 7]
How do I do that?

[Speaker 3]
Import an elk drop it on the board Okay Okay, so Kibi you were attacking Yes, that is a 12 10 11 and another 10 for damage There's two 33s in PC Plus three.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's not gonna do it. I did not just get Rick rolled fuck That's infuriating Just use plutonium import the other hand going to use Rebuke bring it Make me dick save I get advantage on that you do that pass.

That is true that that's true You bastard fuck you This is so good. All right six He's got one hit point.

[Speaker 1]
Nice.

[Speaker 3]
He doesn't go down fully. He's got five hit points, but because of his Long death he comes back up to one.

[Speaker 1]
Okay All right, oh I had to comment selected that's my bad but now for Scott Everybody just nice and close I'm gonna be discussed. Oh, that's a three-person squad. Okay Miss It's a studio you your turn passes.

You were no longer surprised Up goblins squad is up swipe out here The squad is going to provoke an attack of opportunity from the studio whoo Don't like that.

[Speaker 2]
No, that means you get a hit because they moved away from you.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
I know but why Does he moved away from you?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they don't yeah, but why are they moving away because they're gonna attack?

Nope. Just go ahead and do your rolls and then Yeah All right. This is a 33 and a 24 to hit damage To 15s and Two sixes Wow, okay two fifteens and two sixes for damage When I go with Susudio am I able to punch and bite because I have two attacks or do I have to do the same kind of attack I Think what is the action cost of the?

That's the bite phrase It's a natural weapon I gotta ping the bite chat.

[Speaker 3]
Okay It doesn't really have like a damage role or not damage an attack role it just has a damage role So I don't know how that works.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it seems like just a regular You're missing half or more of your hit points advantage all attacks you make this fight too. Yeah, so you can Constitution yeah, you just replace one of your attacks with that one Okay, cool Thank you All right, let's keep these go chilly Do I have can I back?

[Speaker 3]
No I'm gonna back up No, I'm gonna go. No, I can't go anywhere.

[Speaker 1]
Never mind Kind of cornered and I don't want to apply Squad gonna check out Ah A hit Ow Versatile 48 Jesus all right Gonna make a concentration save Yep one second one two three Okay Concentration DC 14 I'm good Okay, yep Squad is done. The princess to studio.

[Speaker 3]
All right That's a I'm gonna hit first this is gonna poison him If it hits obviously It hits. Okay, so that's a 12 plus Poison I'm gonna say Yeah, I'm gonna tag it really quickly Hold on wrong thing Wrong poison. There we go You see you come he's probably gonna pass it, but it's worth a try You see You still have to make it a bunch of times all right, so that's a Do I just roll can I just roll a con?

Yeah, just do another unarmed strike And then we will do oh I get advantage on that but it doesn't matter He gets to think it's to attempt hit points or not to hit points back We get hit points they get hit points not just down.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, cool All right a bonus action Can I flurry of blows it Yeah Now yeah Does he have to make it a another does I Just scroll up and do the poison thing I'll get the poison thing go ahead and roll your extra attack. Oh Yeah, there's a second Because you could either just attack once as a bonus action or you could do flurry of blows and that lets you do 21 I think it's Oh Yes, I love that wait does that mean his bite is too well, that's not a skin that's his teeth He fails the last one either way. He's now poisoned.

Oh, I can I can I can roll poison That's fucking pathetic, but okay nickel and dime this bitch There we go, all right anything else your turn I don't believe so Still charm Agnes Yeah I Succeed yeah, okay. He's the guys behind him. I'm going to take that day Well, oh no They need to be killed at some point Yeah Well that gets rid of all the guys Oh what temporary hit points Yeah, all right anything for your bonus action Misty step out of this whole situation No I'm all done I'm deciding I have to put this carefully Or maybe not maybe it doesn't help me at all right Okay Versus the studio Great weapon master.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I still hit yes Okay 34 damage, okay.

[Speaker 3]
He's down again. Actually wait. Can you know he can't come back up again?

[Speaker 1]
Or knocks Okay The new TV the TV use great weapon master or not for master reckless Yep, always always assumed She's always more than willing to take a hit 29 to hit if they can't save All right, all right cubes You do succeed Resistant to radiant damage No Cold slashing piercing and bludgeoning Does him being poisoned do anything Yes He rolled with disadvantage versus the studio. I should have a straight role versus TV I think it would still have been a 29 cuz the 11 first But thank you because I remember that's something that always trips me up between D&D and a Pathfinder Because none of it's like flat almost none of it's like flat bonuses. All right, so first person's first damage 16-2 which is radiant Every second was left.

We'll dump a third one.

[Speaker 3]
Okay Did that give me did that give me XP or take it away I can't can't tell it points What were you at previously I Don't know I Think pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
I might have given you some Okay, then I need to be at 48 instead And then this is all radiant damage so 11 and then 14 so that's all radiant damage It's all radiant damage the 11 and 14 gonna smack you again with heretic Stop it Normal attack Go ahead and make me con save The good news is one of us is getting heretic Yeah But look at the look at the personality on it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, you pretty much be It's evil and it wants anyone who's only to be dead. So Okay, but then you'd be killing Hestia. So Cuz like that's what it's it's gonna want because Hestia is like The antithesis.

[Speaker 2]
I always want the ones that end up cursed and I never realized they're cursed Just like oh that's so cool All right, an additional 16 radiant damage Can you stop please Are you down?

[Speaker 3]
No Well, you're at 14 and I saw the six go down I didn't see the ten go down I'm pretty sure it did.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Damn it. All right No No, there's um, it's it's the two most recent so it's the wine smite That's the 2d8 and then I took 10 Man I didn't kill you.

[Speaker 3]
All right, he is going to provoke an attack of opportunity from keep Yes, and no, I mean it is down Fuck yeah, fuck this guy everybody else.

[Speaker 1]
I could be in like range of She kills him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, she's she's fucking desecrating his corpse. Yeah Yeah, I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
I have five hit points left. Ah Didn't apply the extra no did okay Is he alive? He's alive.

[Speaker 3]
He has five hit points left now He won't be in a minute I have a feeling my companions will take care of him this action. Oh Who are you hitting?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I've had a very good grip on Fine smart.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Jesus Christ Okay, let's see one I'm fine barely Okay, so that would be 12 but then it's one two Three four five six, so it'd only be six All right, so I am gripping to my health by the ends of my fingers Because I have seven hit points. Hmm I've got seven hit points You know how my my my sword has a function against magic users yes, um yeah, and So it reduces the damage per dice So it's minus one per dice.

[Speaker 1]
So that's the only reason I'm still standing pretty good, especially as a guy who rolls this many fucking dice Uh-huh. All right, that is the end of his turn. You're up Okay Don't make me constant.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe concentration Right, yes, of course, of course and I'll get plus two to this because Does that The DC would be 22 4 8 so 11 what? Oh, is it not the highest source of damages in total?

[Speaker 1]
It's the damage Back But how much but you've been reducing the damage for die, right Yes, right.

[Speaker 4]
So oh Wait, let me do the math one sec Yeah, it's below if that takes it below 34 if you didn't take more than 34 damage then that would succeed Okay, one two three four five six seven eight Yeah Yeah, all right, it's eight days total cool awesome Question can I use a potion as an action? Thanks All right It's fine. And then we are going to make a grand escape Because I don't like getting hit in the face so much so We're going here and then I'm going up Sir what did you do?

[Speaker 1]
Though misty step misty step.

[Speaker 4]
Yes Oh No, right that bloody custom Mage slayer Yes, yes, I forgot about that There's a 15 here Yes, just it just gets me yes Well, in fact in order to not hit me you would have to roll a 1 29 Okay, I I'm very much down and falling on my face. I Even reduced I can't Yeah Well, hello.

[Speaker 1]
It means you're no longer concentrating as well. But all right, so you guys see I'm gonna go to step and like and Instead of just like the normal graceful lighting upon some other side of the room You just hear like a smack against the floor and see At your glimpse of commons feet sliding out the door. Yeah, just areas All right, yes, yeah, I'm Staying here Yep Valid All right Hey nobody, oh I'm fine.

[Speaker 2]
He's fine. You actually haven't hit him Like at all so You miss me about yourself, oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right. How do you want to do this?

[Speaker 2]
Oh Look at these hordes within my ten reach. I don't even think Knox would like Pause and make it anything. He just cut him down and then go to the horde dirty You have great weapon master he's comfortable right there he can reach them No, okay first the elk will go miss These guys I'll help you.

[Speaker 7]
I hit once Also, um since the person I cursed the bone ours guy died I get some temporary hit points Not not temporary I regained hit points equal to what? Yeah, we're lock level plus charisma.

[Speaker 1]
So say anything with your bonus action. No Why are they plus three that's how many there are okay 16 13 6 and 5 Went down Once back and he's still hard. So you still have just not doing great.

[Speaker 3]
There's one guy It's all the Kiwi can do actually. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's all the key we can do Squad time attack Rinald and missed the squad attacking Rinald also miss the sooner you Maybe that's it.

[Speaker 6]
Does he have does he have advantage on death saves?

[Speaker 3]
Do you think I think that's a thing? Much of dad.

[Speaker 2]
I was just focused on killing all of them.

[Speaker 1]
It's awesome player I'm goblin squad. Why do they all have like 12 fucking hit points?

[Speaker 2]
It's not If you survive until knocks he could heal you No, I'm sure you'll hit yes, oh Appreciate you It's my pack spell slot, okay, I'm I think I had a little bit of a better Fuck yeah, but it went better for me that did for you Oh, this is every feature. Oh, I just want to see what the area of effect is gonna be I'm fairness Rinaldo's already down.

[Speaker 1]
So you'd like to put it right on top of them and then hit all three of the I was Gonna do the color spray again.

[Speaker 2]
Oh Cuz he's not conscious.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Let me get rid of that cuz that's for something else Yeah, okay Pesci's not there. So you could definitely angle this day at all Cool Oh, I didn't do the stupid level I wanted a different level Just go back into your thing and Yeah, you could refund yourself a first level spell slot, yeah, I want these guys Gone so we're at that issue of spelling use If that's all of them Who here speaks goblinoid I Think Knox does Knox definitely does.

Yes Yes Yes, it's goblin. What is a anti-agnos I'm she She's a goblin I made two goblins.

[Speaker 1]
Look at that Two things happen one the the goblin squads are going to surrender Do with them is up to you. Well, I should roll for it. Yeah, they're gonna surrender And then second so studio can't hear it everyone who speaks goblin can coming out of the static you voice comes out of the black box and says I'll be seeing you again at midnight What time is it now is it like midnight in five minutes or midnight No, it's like, you know, well, no you guys were in the middle of your watch.

So it's like it's like 4 in the afternoon Okay, and the Both breakers body begins burning up No, I wanted to smash it.

[Speaker 3]
Well He'll be back in by midnight

[Speaker 2]
So says that's weird contraption that frog has We have two people down speaking speaking of hang on hang on hang on Knox says so Is it oh I'm gonna That I have

[Speaker 1]
You guys if you guys have a long rest or restart your long rest, I guess Yes Everybody gets that you will be able to complete it before midnight and you'll have an hour left to adventure

[Speaker 2]
Yes, everybody should get that. I think there's I think there's less than six of us Knocks don't take it, but everybody else who needs it can Thank you very much, yeah, I Technically can't cast it again if we need to But I would also burning reminiscent.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I would suggest we do a the short rest before our long rest Yeah

[Speaker 1]
I Give a song of rest if you guys long rest you will have one hour to adventure or midnight if you short rest and then long rest you will have about seven minutes

[Speaker 2]
All right, so we have seven minutes to plan

[Speaker 3]
Um, I think you know what we don't need to short rest Do we I mean we just fought our way through

[Speaker 6]
The challenges of the sleep

[Speaker 2]
Well, all of us spell casters are out of spell slots

[Speaker 3]
Everybody gets 25 healing So are we short resting first?

[Speaker 5]
Um, if it's really that much of a concern we can just long rest I Think we all need a long rest Maybe Knox doesn't actual so long rest is guaranteed pretty much what we're trying to figure out is do we want an hour? To explore after we long rest or do we want a short rest and have seven?

[Speaker 2]
Do we know how to contain whatever he is? Do we even know what he is resurrecting Can we figure out what he's a goblin?

[Speaker 3]
Oh breaker I think heart was asking if the burning of his body was reminiscent of the same burning that Happened when those people who were following us died. Yes Thank you. Oh my god.

Are these the same? Oh my god. There's no way these fuckers work for the same fucking fiend.

[Speaker 2]
Oh Our old buddy or old pal Yeah Well, there is a fiend at the end of the thing that we're supposed to defeat And if we explore for an hour we need to make sure that we don't find the fiend Don't find Well, okay. I don't know. I mean whatever.

I was just thinking if we have this guy come back at midnight Well, we have the fiend like that stuff Mmm, we would have to defeat him before the hours up Okay If we get lucky, but I do have to leave in 30 minutes Yeah We want the hour we want the hour Yeah, we're just gonna long rest.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Give me Five minutes here.

[Speaker 3]
Can we go ahead and do the long rest thingy or do we do the long rest thing? You go ahead and expend your hit dice and such Baby I start this short rest since it Oh Well, yeah only to do the the hit dice, but All right, I only got 51 hit points back. Oh wait use all my hit dice That's 120 Whoo 120 good to go Yummy spell slots.

Oh, yeah, it feels good to actually have spells again I bet so Or like this box that I have the the lantern.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah It's nice Everybody wakes up feeling refreshed All right, let's go I'm guessing he didn't leave a sword behind in the ashes no It's for the best. How many surrendered goblins do we have? Okay, I was gonna say we can make them sit here and guard these people or we can make them fight for us I don't feel like they're gonna want these gorblins to So we can make them Like hires for us if we want Um, the pixies will offer you 200 gold for the in their words All food That you have left over ABC's no wrong with this.

Yeah, it's fine We both them oath of ancients by the way, yeah Oh Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with I don't think there's a negative circle of life It's all about balance.

[Speaker 3]
It's about protecting beautiful places Yes, also that would these goblins know anything about? who or What is going on with this dude? Why he burst into flames what fiend he works for maybe?

[Speaker 1]
They I guess in their view heroically The chosen served even in death who? Keep looking.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure he'll find you He's gonna pick one up and start moving towards the wolves Intimidation check He doesn't block All right intimidation. Come on Kibi.

[Speaker 1]
You got this 22 Wait, wait Who it's it's he's a servant of boy she His name is frost top He said he's a servant of oisin, which is this it's It resides in the kingdom of the dead Can you type that out?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, I want to see how bad my All right, she'll release him just awesome on the floor Are we not gonna still feed them?

[Speaker 3]
She's she's not The Pixies can feed them to the wolves. She's not gonna do it.

[Speaker 5]
It was not the corpses.

[Speaker 2]
It was the guys Yeah, I Think Knox would just leave he just like shrug and leave like I'm not a part of this Circle of life.

[Speaker 1]
All right, where are you folks going?

[Speaker 3]
I just moved not sure so he wasn't there when the Would this pit fiends Do I know if this could be the same pit fiend that is harassing my cousin did you know for certain?

[Speaker 1]
Uh Not for certain but would it seem Reasonable yeah, okay Perfection I think that probably he would think he would know at some point that not the true name of the pit fiend, but Can I put it in his character? That'd be okay if I just went ahead and like put it in his character thread, yeah Nice We get to say you have the same symbol as this at this particular region of pop goblins Which were you guys going?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna give the studio a potion because he needs he needs healing Are we just gonna continue on?

[Speaker 5]
Do we have any not?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry Alder, can you say again? Are we just gonna continue on like we have not to just go in the way we're going right but which way are you guys Go this this room.

[Speaker 3]
This cavern is clear Okay, so there's not like another door to go through No, there it is.

[Speaker 2]
It's it's Where would the next door be I figured we would just go across the bridge to the other side of the pixie town, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's I don't want to go too far without everyone in case like some weird combat shit starts Yeah, I'm getting a lot of lag How are you doing something There I assumed it was But okay, so the last time No, I think you were actually told this by the pixies. It's It's through the town East Okay, so we're going the right way Is that east? No, you follow the you follow the briar bridge.

[Speaker 5]
Oh down this way Yeah, you are coin still work It's okay, hang on give me a second I've got I have How many do we get back on a long rest How many what how many dice thingies do we get back? You get one Okay, so I have six Um, I'll roll three of them.

[Speaker 4]
You only get one hit dice back mine gave me a lot more That's because there's no automatic rules for it So only have four hit dice 3d 8 8 Yes 20 times You can just change it If you If you if you're on the newer She and you go into editing mode the little cog by your hit dice should allow you to change it Yeah, all right, um Kibi and Susudio will be on the water.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, what is this? Is this a bridge?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, let me place it first proper There we go new bridge early truly making this place a walkable city I will be right back.

[Speaker 2]
I wonder if it's your bridges lagging everything.

[Speaker 5]
Oh I think it's it could be could also be the number of tokens.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah It's all good.

[Speaker 1]
We won't be here that long You guys make it to the edge there. There are Bay sitting at the top sort of resembles a Leprechaun holding a deck of cards Gambling Kibi's weakness You guys are bearing the tokens from the two guards outside Yeah, sorry and also I guess my sword Yes, also that I forgot about that All right. Well, it'll only appear if you have to go through the door and then shut it behind you.

There's the block Once I do that, he'll appear What are you looking to kill?

[Speaker 2]
Oh So we just walk through we shut the door and then It'll appear and then you start killing him. He kills you Wow, okay It's the book so we have time Yeah, we've moved to you at that time Go prepare What are the car?

[Speaker 1]
So just an old Fate Rick. Oh I'd read your fates, but then I'd have to take them.

[Speaker 5]
Oh Oh, well, we'll have none of that we would like to keep her fate He's just gonna go All right, by the way, I can give that to five Oh my god, is that no have to braid its fur or its tail Yep Five creatures that I can see at the end of my wrist. So how many people do we got?

[Speaker 6]
We have Six including me.

[Speaker 5]
So five would be everyone gets temper.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so 15 temporary hit points.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no, you guys get 10 There's your temporary hit points everyone Every gets temporary Follow me you slow mortals.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have all eternity Maybe in front.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah You need to write your name in Hestia's book, oh Hey, oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah you went down Can he do that really quickly Yeah, do you think yeah, okay. Yes, right his name I can have four names in there. He has really neat handwriting And the doors over to the left you guys should be able to see it are these people were fighting No Their tail is already braided.

I see I will get one of these one day.

[Speaker 5]
I Think we're going here.

[Speaker 4]
I'll be right back y'all Yeah, I'll be there so Then I was just trying to think since we're going in I was just what to set up before the fight begins And that's Hello What are we doing Is there anything?

[Speaker 2]
Um one would like to set up before we get to go Okay, I am back and following I Don't think there's anything I can set up. So no, I can't set up anything I mean, I guess I can it lasts a minute and if we're just about to do this, what are we expecting?

[Speaker 3]
All right Activate a couple of my features I hope I don't want to actually if this is the fiend that Has our old buddy our old pal Yeah, this is the feet. I don't want to like kill him Because I want scooter to be able to have the privilege to I we haven't we've killed him multiple times Okay

[Speaker 4]
He'll be fine

[Speaker 3]
Do not want to steal that from my friends

[Speaker 2]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
It's not Okay, they'll tell you right now it's not a pick me let's see

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well, there's a lot less of us, okay, so studio kiwi and Is it I'm casting bless sub to three cures can add a d4 to their Attack roll or saving throw how many times just once? Whenever the target makes an attack until the spell and okay.

Yeah And I guess I'll do knock since we're gonna be Frontliners Does anybody really want the bless fine, oh Actually who would benefit from a bout of invisibility? Uh, well If you cast spells that damage does that knock you out of invisibility No, this is great.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry. I should clarify greater invisibility so It shan't I would assume Hestia or Agnes could whichever one If Agnes will take it, all right it would also be good for the frontliners as well if they want it instead because then if they get advantage on their hits and then disadvantage when getting hit or Should it just go to one of the other spell casters I'm here.

[Speaker 5]
I just I don't have an opinion I'm sorry. I'm really hungry.

[Speaker 1]
It's hard to think This Do you guys could resolve this pretty quickly I think Let's Yeah, I honestly don't know what we're waiting for oh Let's go in then let's go fight Open the door No, there's another Oh in here, oh Oh my bad.

[Speaker 3]
I thought we were there already Was weird all the squishies get get behind get behind the non squishies All right Oh god, it's taking so long It's probably the auras loading in that's all. Why does he have multiple auras? What?

Whoa, Susudio Calm down He's vibrating Oh, it's absolutely the auras I will undo the auras.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
It's still there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Hang on.

[Speaker 3]
Okay Um What is this little Sun symbol beside him did that help yeah, maybe oh He's cursed. Why are we totally I don't know why we're all cursed.

[Speaker 1]
I kept asking Can I be uncursed statues?

[Speaker 6]
Sure Yeah Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh TB still has a curse on her sword that she can use but she wants to use it on somebody who Who's gonna live I want to use it on somebody I can put it on who's going to live Yeah, somebody she's not gonna kill somebody.

[Speaker 6]
She's going to maim And how does it do so here I'll just um, I'll put it in chat All right, you folks ready? Yes Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Enter and close the door The bindings come to life at the center of the room and while they they lax or loosen ever so slightly Allowing a friend here to begin move everybody to go ahead and rule this room are we covered by it?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's not just under it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Everybody add like just one foot to your token For elevation That's That's fun start with Kibi All right keeps All right, I might need to be reminded of that yeah 12 15 10 Make sure that you target him when you do that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay 1510 You know what I'm gonna go ahead and action search Fair And she will do it all again.

[Speaker 1]
Oh She's got a rage Pretend she raged first Oh, okay, pretty good 10 12 5 11 The boom down 54 hit points All right, he roars and you see him much a odd-looking to this guy. You see that he's got like one Really weird-looking fang. It looks weird to begin with but one of his larger fangs at the front is just made That from its skull Well, that's going on So Agnes are you needed?

[Speaker 2]
I am Sure Whoops no, just kidding. I'm not doing this No, thank you, no, I am my bad I Please forget. Okay.

I'm just kidding. I'm gonna do something a little bit more Look radius.

[Speaker 1]
You could put it at the corner.

[Speaker 2]
I Mean if you'll allow me to do that, yeah Yeah, there you go Okay, cool. And then as my bonus action, I will lightning them Cool, what's that?

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry about Non-resistance, that's all right. So studio just shoot.

[Speaker 3]
Yo I thought I told you to stop being cursed I'm gonna see if this guy can be poisoned and then I'll start hitting him with my 22s It's a 10 and a 12 and I will see if he can not be poison

[Speaker 1]
Hit his AC exactly Oh

[Speaker 3]
Fear blows here to flurry of those Okay Damn yeah that one That's Nate

[Speaker 1]
Very good All right

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'm gonna try casting Otto's irresistible dance on him

[Speaker 3]
That's a fun one

[Speaker 4]
And then

[Speaker 6]
Can I silvery barge that

[Speaker 1]
You can but he's going to catch boo He's got a ring on these two very large gauntlets, but he's wary

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well I would have cast it and then he counter spells me and Then what do you say? Otto's irresistible dance counts as a charm?

[Speaker 3]
Well, it's an enchantment, right?

[Speaker 1]
Pictures that can't be charmed are immune to the spell But it's like I'd let not a pattern do it because it's specifically said that they were charmed by it That's fair.

[Speaker 4]
That's fair. Well spell fail Mm-hmm, that's fair. Oh, well spell fails.

I give a bardic inspiration to Hestia and that will be my turn Oh I'm not getting picked up.

[Speaker 5]
I'm being too quiet I Was muttering what I was saying I'm gonna magic missile him magic miss you do have the bardic inspiration. I just gave you Oh, yes, what is a bardic exploration? It's a d1 d10 what?

A d1.

[Speaker 6]
I'm fading so fast guys. It's a one-sided coin. Oh Perfect.

Oh shit. Nice

[Speaker 5]
How does that work with I think it just adds damage

[Speaker 7]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
But I think it adds it to like one damage roll and then that gets repeated for

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I suppose that would make that 70 Cuz it's seven strikes

[Speaker 1]
He's gonna have he's not looking so great

[Speaker 6]
And

[Speaker 5]
I don't have bonus action So, that's me All righty, yep, there we go, it's not technical my turn so I can't end it

[Speaker 1]
two of the chains that are binding this gentleman are going to evaporate but not before they lash out All right, so sudio ki be knocks and famine go ahead and make saving throws

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy, remember you most likely have advantage No TV does And you you have advantage plus a three

[Speaker 3]
What why would oh damn studio doesn't even take damage Give you what is the DC and just 14?

[Speaker 2]
Oh Nice okay, so maybe we'll take half You want me to think it again no Says advantage doesn't I Wasn't sure. Yes, he does. Yeah sounds about right.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then Where do you see advantage come from by the way?

[Speaker 2]
He's paladin, right, so I know yes are hoarding so it has like damage spell resistance and then there's There's the sword and then there's or of warding or a protection and then aura of courage The sword gives the advantage against spell effects and stuff All right, so it was 21 damage to those of you who fail and if you succeed Hey, it's Baylor's turn All right.

[Speaker 1]
So start of his turn What did you say? At the start of its turn. Oh, I have to do a bunch of things Hey two things.

Uh, so studio takes 40 fire damage TV It's not a spell Oh TV action surge, so that's

[Speaker 2]
They still get a plus three

[Speaker 1]
35 fire damage because if you hit this thing within a radius You will or touches a Baylor or hits it, but the melee attack takes 3d6 damage For some reason the fire aura and the thing where it starts at the beginning of its turn does two different things and finally Not ski be and so studio.

Additionally take 11 fire damage first things first Punish Belden because that is the one who's here to challenge him. He is angry as shit. Oh He sees the lady of the lake sword the lady of the lake sword sees him back you can feel it perceiving Through you and he is.

Oh We can talk about this I know you wouldn't say that Remember your sword does have the ability to Perry.

[Speaker 2]
That's right.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm just I told one That's off with attack Would you like to memory? Yeah The the Perry things were as we actually we're going to roll an attack of your own if your attacks exceeds his oh Yeah, okay. Oh, that was close Doesn't have it in the description Is the description parrot or sorry otter the description overrides the earth the chat?

Yeah description overrides the chat message, right I'm sorry, what? for an item Oh like the chat description Sorry about that, I'll check it afterwards. I don't know where yeah, but sorry, that's the Holy Adventure thing Oh It does why why does it do that?

[Speaker 5]
Oh because chat just okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Oh, it's expired Do me I can't wait to get those Is it so We need plus 14 to hit so the 22 hit knocks Hey, yeah, he doesn't have his armor anymore, right? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I think even with his armor 22 It's like a 21 or something.

[Speaker 1]
I can take 23 damage okay, and then a 22 hit yeah, he has his AC is 15 It's 1d 6 budgeting 1d 6 force and 3d 6 fired But that is the entirety of his turn We come down with the knocks Yes, you also get yeah You also get an additional 2d 10 damage for it being a fiend Okay, I think is for each hit or total for each hit you hit once Okay, that's AC 22 right now Go ahead and roll one extra d8. It's when you hit a fiend or undead with What you call it? It does that damage?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, anything for your bonus action He doesn't have anything worthwhile for bonus actions, you know, that's his turn and that also means Okay, wait, wait before you do found the description.

[Speaker 1]
It just wasn't in your It wasn't in your sword, but it was in the flamed item sword. Oh Yeah, earlier I dragged that over what I need you to do is that the way that Perry works is not the attack It's the damage if your damage exceeds his Okay, then it hits and the damage you took from the the damage from the whip was 26 total You'd be 26 damage. I Mean so I roll my damage right so roll your damage and whatever you would like to add to it Right, that's fine.

Whatever I'm not that way That's the 11 and you've got the 2d 10 And it's a fiend so you get an additional d8 on top of that I Know it's a lot. All right. Yeah, so you would not have taken the damage from earlier the 20 whatever the 26 fire damage Okay All right Okay, now I go All right Wait bring her back I'll see if I can message her.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think she will though No, that's because she's probably got a rush to grab all the kids and everything.

[Speaker 1]
We'll be on its last legs. He be Huh finish thing finish this thing off.

[Speaker 3]
It's in a stalemate with knots and It's it's in a stalemate with not imagine I got No, I I got one at least so that's a 16 plus a 4 I don't feel like doing the math there 20 20.

[Speaker 1]
All right. How do you and not want to do this?

[Speaker 3]
Oh Whoo, does this thing have wings it does All right. We each individually cut off a wing And plunge it into like his back both of us our swords like cross, you know, like plunged into his back

[Speaker 1]
Hey guys, we've under knocks Perry's a rather brutal blow from the whip and uses that slicer be It's when the whip drags knocks for that he takes uses the momentum to slice off a wing And tries to choke the a war out with his own even as he's burning out You come around the other side and chop off the other wing it strikes a big war long enough so that he can not seem pretty sword and You both just split this thing down the middle

[Speaker 6]
causes this

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so that's Kibi

[Speaker 1]
That's That's everybody within 30 feet, which I think is everybody Kevin you have like three quarters covered you could add this five to your room

[Speaker 5]
five that would

[Speaker 1]
Be and the bonus that you get from okay good. Oh, yeah So 71 damage on her failure and half on a success What was the DC?

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, you could have the teeth

[Speaker 4]

[Speaker 3]
Oh right, I Mean we can we can discuss it later then when she's around Yeah, I do you want me to delete the teeth from the bag we're just actually put to put a zero for quantity or something I do have to think I would oh, hey, I forgot to put my armor back on You can just drag it It's I think it just copies in yeah, I would kind of like the ring of text Okay Who's taking the protection ring?

[Speaker 6]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if anybody I I Almost feel like maybe that would be good for like knocks or Kibbe only has one attunement slot left and that's going towards Actually, no, she she doesn't have one attunement slot. Oh my god the teeth require attunement. I Know never mind somebody else can have the fucking teeth I Actually, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna use them until I wait I Can't use the fucking teeth.

All right, somebody else can have them You can't use the teeth Yeah, I didn't even look at what the teeth do Oh they summon things Okay I'm gonna delete it from my inventory So am I meditating here with studio Yes, oh that was right It was also go We resolve that now so I don't have to do it and didn't downtime.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I have to do is that The sections over so you guys are good to go.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna start putting stuff in session reports for me To just delineate the loop that you guys got Should I separate it by all of the players or separate it by like only who's here and Nessie the ones who are doing the fight like should I include rez and What's his Phineas? Yes Phineas. Uh Should I be nice to them?

[Speaker 1]
I Mean res did participate Phineas didn't get to you get to act much today, unfortunately But you can oh, no, what do you think froggin heart?

[Speaker 3]
I'm totally okay with sharing.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'll split by players. So that would be Okay That is one thousand three hundred and sixty Per player not per character All right, can I just give it all the one one character That's kind of how I was figuring.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to studio.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, we can Do whatever she's only remaining XP were from the Baylor and from the world. I spelled player 25,000 and 22,000 respectively. So I have to split those up and for those two it was seven Much gold you got.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you have a lot of fucking gold. Who has more gold?

[Speaker 5]
Probably keep me I have to remember what I can do with Whoops did I put that in the wrong thing? No, that's this thing.

[Speaker 1]
I did also the place where the studio has to chill out is video and TV What do I need to roll also I'm gonna stay in this hollow if I fail this I'm gonna stay in the hollow until I Can get it, right?

[Speaker 3]
I don't quite understand the meditation Like I can read it.

[Speaker 5]
I just can't understand you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink it If you know kind of where you're getting hung up on it Just let's see, let me read it.

[Speaker 6]
I always forget that I'm supposed to That's right.

[Speaker 3]
I Don't know what it does. That's You get don't understand what focus points are.

[Speaker 5]
It's like a spell slot almost I Think I don't remember exactly what they do because it doesn't say it in here But then I Yeah, I I used to know I used to because I used to do it all the time But focus spells are special spells that like Ah Yes spell can be cast without consuming a spell slot by expending a number of focus points equal to the spells level So yeah, they're just like spell slot And then focus spells are special spells you get from certain area and they're like temporary

[Speaker 3]
Well, I got a six studio got a 16 and Kiwi got a 17 Which is ironic. I'm hoping it's not a DC of money.

[Speaker 1]
So I think if you What level?

[Speaker 3]
Aren't either them above a level 11 Gibi's level 14 and I think the studio's 12 Oh studios 13 Because it's 5 plus your level.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so let me give me just a moment because I need to Is if you have somebody else leading you through it it's supposed to make it like easier 6714 so I'm not making you wait and clock down time now Meditation protection So you're honored So did somebody take the ring of protection? I think I think I did This requires the participant to make a intelligence wisdom or charisma based insight role the DC for this role equals five plus the characters level on a success the character can choose between getting focus spells or focus points The characters can lead one another through meditation the leading character can't folk in the focus points or focus spells blah blah blah but they do gain half of the experience provided the Their pupil meanwhile gains a bonus equal to their tutors level or challenge rating

[Speaker 3]
So what does that mean? What level? Like just their level in general.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you add so studios level to your role 13.

[Speaker 3]
Yep Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right Rolling 22 That's the point is it's meant to Make you succeed and I guess I never put that note about monks in there, but I'll do that How long does Kibi have to meditate here?

[Speaker 3]
She has a short attention span.

[Speaker 1]
It's it's a week We're just like you guys are already supposed to be in doubt technically supposed to be in time jail for a little while anyways Okay, so this will provide you with some extra time jail, which is great because then we could get back to the brilliant sesh session, yes

Well done tonight that was Hope you have thank you Much appreciated I Had the funniest move of just fucking Lee That was that was the best. Yes, I thought it worked. I thought I'd be able to move So I didn't think I'd just get stuck there Yeah, but if I came back it would be a whole turn before I'd got to get to do anything else and Like at that point he would just have killed me instantly.

[Speaker 1]
So it was not worth it His plan because he has great weapon master and like three taxes that just keep like knocking exactly Every time people got brought up a little bit would have been like bam and then off them Yeah, which is why I stayed there Well, um, good night slash it's it's night for you guys now, right This guy's dead.

[Speaker 5]
Does that guy not come back now?

[Speaker 1]

He's not going to show back up I'll also change my mind in the next few weeks for when you guys would be when do you guys? Okay, so you arrive at the Orchid Hollow and then you take a long rest which means the next day But no, that's incorrect It'll be the same day you guys got here early in the you guys got to be quite Orchid Hollow early

[Speaker 3]
Do you know anything about it?

[Speaker 1]
I know that there's a great deal of holy energies nearby and it's not... I'm certainly not incentivized to go anywhere near it. I know that there's also some divine figures or demigods have attached their energies to this place.

I believe in my studies from afar, I did determine that whoever walked through its doors would be transported a great distance away. Oh. Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
Windows? And what of the windows?

[Speaker 1]
I believe it's the same effect. It's that first floor. There's a great space in between that first floor and the remaining levels of the tower.

[Speaker 2]
That is very fascinating. Thank you for your information.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. If you'll prize what's inside the tower, I certainly wouldn't mind some additional knowledge if you happen to find anything of scholarly sort.

[Speaker 2]
So far, they're trained then.

[Speaker 4]
Are you planning on hanging out here?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm... The threat that was once posed to me here seems to have dissipated ages ago. At least it's no longer in relative range.

So I could use this as a kind of base unknown. To no reason other than...

[Speaker 2]
May we inquire... May we inquire about the threat?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, my old colony.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm... Oh, let's check out... How is it that you've lived so long?

Is that... Especially without eating. Is that the effect of the ritual or effect of you?

[Speaker 1]
That was the effect of something I did to myself long ago. Wanted to ensure my permanent freedom from the Elder Mind and as a result... I am no longer the same kind of a...

No longer of the same stock. Colleagues, you could call them in the colony.

[Speaker 4]
Do you still eat brains?

[Speaker 1]
I certainly can, but it doesn't really give me the same satisfaction. Nowadays, I sacrifice people to Imperia. It's much more efficient than gaining energy.

[Speaker 4]
I told you we should have brought a sacrifice. A sacrifice? I think we have a fish in our bag somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
Is there any particular... Person you start... Like, can we go...

If we find someone bad, can we just kill them too?

[Speaker 1]
Wait, sorry, speaking out of character... Are you, like, offering this guy, like, one of the peasants of the caravan? What's this?

[Speaker 3]
No, not the peasants of the caravan.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Like, if we encounter, like, an evil asshole, can we, like, bring this guy? If bandits attack us, can we tie them up and bring them to this guy?

[Speaker 6]
I'll stick to the play of characters of people you bootchain.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright. Yeah.

Makes sense. Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
Let's make, like, a monthly trek to this tower to give the new bandits...

[Speaker 2]
It would be such a favor.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, lady, you're going into the trash compactor. Unfortunate.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, was that the person who left?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that was...

[Speaker 5]
I wondered who their character was.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Ryan left, which was unfortunate. I thought they could hang. My faith was restored.

What's your year?

[Speaker 2]
Um, said I'll be.

[Speaker 1]
If you do, I could potentially provide a service for you as well. My interest is in lost items or artifacts across the valley. Things that get unearthed for short moments, but find themselves lost to time again.

Before I was imprisoned here, well, safeguarded here. This is my primary area of research. If you bring me these sacrifices, I would be quite happy to provide you some of the locations of these items, or perhaps some of them to me here.

[Speaker 2]
That would be wonderful.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 6]
How out of date is your research, though?

[Speaker 1]
Out of date? So the research... Don't worry about it.

Is there a specific reason, you ask? I sure do. Ah, I see, I see.

Having nothing content with glancing at once, you decide that you really ought to have it a second time. No one else deserves it.

[Speaker 6]
More or less.

[Speaker 1]
Keep you supported, I suppose. Yes, I could certainly keep an eye out.

[Speaker 3]
Is that something you should be worried about?

[Speaker 2]
The Book of Exalted Deeds, or the person who wants to use it again?

[Speaker 6]
I made a deal to put it back.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, with that tree. Oh, okay. Monk was there, Mimosa was not.

[Speaker 6]
I think I can manage on my own without sacrificing people for it. But I will keep this in mind, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
If it helps. You can always not think about sacrificing people.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, he'll take, probably, like...

[Speaker 2]
After all, they attacked you first, so... Self-defense!

[Speaker 1]
You've been to the Willow of Salvation, then, yes?

[Speaker 6]
Possibly, I'm not entirely sure.

[Speaker 1]
That's the Willow of... So the, um... I actually don't know if Rana has books.

No, Rana definitely has, specifically. Because that's where you made that deal, that bargain. I see.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we knew what it was called, though.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. The Willow... No, that's...

But that is a term, it's like... Yes, the Deep is a frequent resting place. Sometimes final resting place for many of these items.

[Speaker 6]
The Deep is an interesting place. We need to go back at some point.

[Speaker 5]
I have to do some fishing in the Sea of Stars. Sea of Stars? Stars?

Seas? I don't know, it's in the Deep somewhere. Ooh, Gibi loves fishing.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the Cavern of Endless Sky is in the Underdark.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, is that a different spot?

[Speaker 1]
So, what they refer to as the Deep is like a different plane of existence. And, like, a sort of lower plane. It's a sort of, like, outer plane.

You have, like, the really big drain catch, that's the Abyss. And then you have, like, the smaller drain catch that kind of, like, parasitizes off the... Takes a little bit off the top of that drain catch, of that flow.

Or diverts a little bit of that flow away from it, and that's called the Deep. It's a different realm with its own rules.

[Speaker 5]
That tree wanted me to make a temple in there.

[Speaker 1]
Curious.

[Speaker 2]
Quick question. Would you know of any sort of artifacts or the like that help with extending one's life in general? Or would it be easier for me to ask for specifics?

Albeit later, when I have said specifics.

[Speaker 1]
As mentioned, I would require something from you in order to bring this over. In order to supply you with this information. But, given that I...

[Speaker 2]
We have just freed you. That is fair.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that was for the information I'm currently giving to you. But I will tell you that, having achieved this sort of pseudo-immortality myself, I'm well equipped to service you in these matters.

[Speaker 2]
Dr. Basia just hums while still writing, of course.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So, you guys are... I'm going to click on the Overworld map here.

You guys are about half a day's travel to the Tower. If you actually go past this little outpost and it skates in the back end, your characters will be able to see it from the entryway that goes back up into the surface world. Go ahead and discuss what it is that you're doing.

Any ways that you would like to prepare or anything like that. I'm going to be gone for about five minutes and then it's encounter time.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Do we know what's in the Tower? Do we have any inkling? Anything at all to work off?

[Speaker 1]
You can attempt some divinations and stuff like that if you want to attempt research. I'm a cleric, of course! Exactly.

If you want to do prayers or shrines or anything like that, that's all fine. I'll be back. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I could try to retain control of general skeletons and stuff so that, you know, we have extra fighting.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, um... There was like a... a folk tale or a tale about two spirits.

Yeah, I'm looking for it, actually. Because I did the RP with James about it, but I don't remember. Okay, I found it.

[Speaker 5]
Happens to the best of us. Your grandmother once told me of the spider and the snake, two warring spirits who inhabited different people throughout history. The spider preferred tyrants, where the snake preferred explorers and free spirits.

They killed one another throughout time, each upsetting a strange natural balance in the world. Usually the blood spilled was even until the spider came to inhabit a human wizard chasing eternal life in the deserts far south of here. The spider hunted the snake across lifetimes, adding her bodies to his onyx pyramid.

Dealt quite a bit of damage to the landscape, to my understanding, and there were grave consequences in that region's woe. The snake spirit came yet again to inhabit a mortal form, but with a complication. For the first time, one of the spirits was born as twins.

The spider only caught one of the snakes. The other was your grandmother. She avenged her twin sister and put the spider to rest, and took some powerful trophies for her efforts, as was the spirit's tradition before she retired in Samhain.

So the tower is where she kept those artifacts, I think. Those trophies.

[Speaker 4]
And we have located the tower now, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, that's where we're going. This is in our sights.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right! Remember last time we were here, there was a thing that made all our spells upcast by one? Oh, yeah.

Too bad it's been, what, three weeks? Yeah. So if any of you have things that, you know, if there are any spells that you would like to upcast now, go ahead and do so.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, was that in effect of here, or was that in effect of, like, the weather?

[Speaker 2]
That was in effect of here. Where we were, we were on a leyline of sorts.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure if it's still on, so we'll have to ask, but, you know, the more skeletons I control, the better. And I imagine other stuff, like, if you have Bless or something.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I feel like skeletons... I mean, I can try not to target them in the crossfire, but a lot of my stuff is radiance.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, nuggets. That's fine. If I keep them away from you...

Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

[Speaker 3]
You could, like, keep them off to the side or something.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Like, in case of emergencies. So she could do a power just to offset it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I could get hat cover from them, then. Like, for everyone with long distance, you can borrow them as body shields.

[Speaker 5]
I could, um, death ward everyone and use up all my level 4 spells.

[Speaker 2]
No, you don't need them. Oh, you don't have to use it on me. I have, um, Parapet of Health, so if I go down, I'll just stabilize.

You have a what? Um, there's this, um, uncommon item. I think it's called Parapet of Health.

Anyway, the point is, the moment you go down... Yes, thank you, that. Um, if you, um...

Yeah, if you go down, you immediately stabilize.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm. I do also have an item that lets me immediately bring you right back up with a reaction.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you, Amaran.

[Speaker 5]
How lovely. My favorite item. Forever and always.

What is the item called? Oh, it's just called Heart of the Healer. It's just a heart-shaped amulet that another player had made.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, swag. Oh, here we go, I've got it. Parapet of Wound Closure.

[Speaker 5]
That's the word.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh.

[Speaker 5]
It also has been more than a week, so I believe my teleport is back in the absolute worst case scenario.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yippee. At least one of us can get out. I'm sure we're not gonna find an evil spirit in there.

I think we'll be fine. Probably not. Sure, definitely not.

Sure, it's empty.

[Speaker 2]
Just a quick question. Was it, like, the first floor of the tower that sent you somewhere else?

[Speaker 4]
Was it that one, or...? Yeah, I think that's what the mind flayer said. Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I was just making sure I didn't get any information incorrect.

[Speaker 4]
Knowing me, probably. Probably heard it wrong.

[Speaker 2]
Such a life.

[Speaker 5]
I think that was the implication of it. Which, I do also have Plane Shift, if that is the case.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Are we... thinking that's, like, a trap? Like, a creepy trap?

It's probably just, like, yeah, the first line of defense.

[Speaker 5]
I'll drop my Control Weather for Plane Shift. I don't think we'll need to control too much weather here.

[Speaker 2]
Double asking with your Radiant damage? If it's not useful, I can always just save my 4th-level slot instead of using it on summoning undead, I guess.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, it depends. Because... we don't really know what we're up against just yet.

[Speaker 3]
That's true. Nope, it's a really, really old tower.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's see. I guess... Yeah, I guess I could use them as meat shields.

That's fine.

[Speaker 3]
So we... The long rest was confirmed, right? Yeah.

Yep, yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wait. I just realized. If we're having a long rest on the way, technically all my spell slots are fine since it's for 24 hours.

Alright, that's good. Uh, I don't know if we're having a long rest on the way.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, I guess. Well, yeah, my long rest was just catching up to the very beginning of the session. Ah, yeah, no.

That long rest was confirmed.

[Speaker 2]
Because it's been a while.

[Speaker 6]
I'd need to look at how quickly you get spell slots back while traveling.

[Speaker 7]
I have to guess what campaign document it's in.

[Speaker 5]
I have just found my new favorite um... minis collection? Oh?

It's called Pinups of Death? Oh?

[Speaker 4]
What is this?

[Speaker 7]
It's not what I'm interested in.

[Speaker 4]
It's definitely piqued my interest, what?

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, repeat that? I can post it in the discords if that'd be easier. It's just, um, I'll put it in voice overflow.

It's basically Arcane Recovery.

[Speaker 5]
It is also in the foundry under, um, exploration, I think?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that was in exploration. It's, um, resting in recovery.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's under the travel section of the, um, foundry PDF that I have up there. Oh, this is the first thing Oh?

[Speaker 7]
Ooh! Ooh!

[Speaker 4]
That's pretty cool. The last one's kind of funny.

[Speaker 1]
So, Dr. Basia, you've been given a spell that allows you to resurrect. Let's see here. Perfect.

I don't know how I missed a text from my boss, like, two hours ago, but I'm sure I did. Dr. Basia, you have a spell that allows you to resurrect apparitions as undead serpents with the zombified template of a CR equal to or lower than whatever you use to cast the spell.

[Speaker 2]
Hooray!

[Speaker 1]
And this is a spell of third level. Oh! Perfect.

Okay, so what would the party like to do?

[Speaker 4]
Guess we should start heading that way.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm happy to start crafting.

[Speaker 2]
Um, would the, um, are the ley lines, the upcast by one thing still on?

[Speaker 1]
On this line, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sweet. So I can keep control of a couple of skeletons. I'll put them down once we move, but yeah.

Alrighty. That's it. That's all I wanted to ask.

Is there... Oh, right. Second thing.

The new spell that you put out later, not now, can you write it out so I can put it in? Thank you. Alright, that's it.

You sure?

[Speaker 4]
Actually, I... No, I'm kidding. I was waiting for that.

I was hoping...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, this isn't even the one I thought it was.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I think it's PRG.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Sounds good. So, you folks are marching out into the...

into another undertunnel, to describe it again for Rana, and to refresh everybody's memory. This exit portal to the surface looks like a tunnel of floating, basically floating, but circulating rock. Regardless of where you're standing, you always feel as if you're proper right-side up, and you move along just kind of like hopping from brick to brick, and making sure that these rings of rock and rings of gravity going in different directions that you basically manage to catch it before anything happens.

When everybody gets outside, you do see a large... It's a mixture of... of...

limestone and sandstone, it almost looks like. It looks rather similar to a lighthouse. Despite the fact there's not really a...

I mean, there's a... there is a body of water nearby this area, but... like, no, not even really nearby.

There's no ships going back and forth between this place. It has a structure of one, nonetheless.

[Speaker 4]
A waterless... a... thing.

What'd you call it? Lighthouse. A waterless lighthouse.

Interesting.

[Speaker 3]
That's what the tower looks like?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Everybody go ahead and make me a perception check. Cool.

You are free to use any exploration role features that you wish. Um, what is it? A perception check.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, two net monies! Look at us!

[Speaker 6]
Good start!

[Speaker 3]
Aww.

[Speaker 5]
Not a bad role, though. It's so funny! No, it's just not green like everybody else's!

[Speaker 1]
So... Okay. So you folks can see...

you're looking closer at this kind of... looking closer at the tower here. You can see that there is kind of...

what looks like a moving image of a serpent with two heads on the tower. You could, like, just barely make it out. Some of you might have, like, binoculars or spine glass making this easier.

But throughout your journey, as you, like, look closer and closer at it, it's going to be easier to tell. You folks, as you move through the trail that does seem to be leading in this direction, you do hear a commotion. You do also hear a commotion in the bushes ahead, and there's a lot of rustling going around.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh. Ooh. Keebee's on it.

What are we doing? Are we fighting? Well, okay, well, no, just...

Her tail's flicking. Her tail's flicking.

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
If I was your handsome, I've got a Keebee. I'm not a fruity user.

[Speaker 1]
You hear sylvan chattering from the bushes, or what's an approximation of sylvan chattering. Those of you who understand sylvan aren't really words so much as kind of like the noises a toddler would make. You see a small horde of boggarts emerging from the bushes, chasing a giant boar around.

About three of these boggarts are currently attached, like, holding on for dear life to the tusk of this boar, and literally only hanging on by their disconnected arms, and there's one on the top, which is attempting and failing to steer the boar by way of holding its ears.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, it's a chase hunt. Are we saving the boggarts? Uh, yes.

Didn't we have some boggart friends?

[Speaker 1]
You did have some boggart friends, actually. They're currently at the caravan. These ones do not have Orion's mark on their head.

They have that spiral that's typically shown there.

[Speaker 4]
Kiwi doesn't notice this. She just thinks they're friends. I got you.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi, go.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Kiwi's gonna take off after him.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Miki. Athletics check.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy. Athletics. You've got this.

Does the 19 19 work?

[Speaker 1]
19 absolutely works. To rapidly catch up to them, the boggarts and the boar are now both scared of you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And running along here.

[Speaker 4]
Does it look like they're trying to ride the boar, or are they trying to eat it?

[Speaker 1]
At the moment it looks like they're trying to ride it.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, could I grapple it?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Are the rest of us just watching on in amusement?

[Speaker 3]
Um, Mimosa is ready for anything, so she's probably following along as long as her little liggies can allow.

[Speaker 4]
Worst case scenario, we fight a bunch of boggarts and get dinner. So...

[Speaker 6]
When you put it that way, then they don't have to think about it.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, all right. So, do I... Probably that's the worst case scenario.

[Speaker 1]
That's normally a athletics check.

[Speaker 4]
Heh heh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah. That's one thing Kibi's good at.

[Speaker 5]
It's grappling and grabbing.

[Speaker 4]
Mmhmm. I got claws, I'll dig in.

[Speaker 1]
You have wrestled this thing to the ground. A couple of the boggarts go flying. You've successfully wrestled this boar into submission.

The boggarts descend on it and begin flying little fetishes and approximations of thorns and... Well, thorns for stirrups and leaves for saddles and cord from stripped, uh, stripped... basically cordwood, um, for reins.

Hm. A few of them have taken... They barely take notice of you at first, but a few of them are looking around and, uh, just kind of in bewilderment.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you cut out right there.

[Speaker 1]
Oh! A few of them are just... A few of them are doing what?

A few of them are just kind of like looking around in bewilderment, wondering how it is that they got this boar, and then they kind of suddenly notice you and go, ah!

[Speaker 4]
You're welcome, friends. You're welcome, friends. Although, why aren't you with the caravan?

I think these are different ones. But they have the swirl.

[Speaker 5]
The ones with the caravan don't have the swirl. They don't?

[Speaker 3]
This is nice, Kibi. They had the moon, right? The crescent moon?

That's right.

[Speaker 4]
They had a crescent moon, Kibi. Oh, okay. Well, enjoy your boar.

[Speaker 1]
One of them starts tugging at your pant leg here. And then starts tugging really vigorously. It's holding something.

It has a small pouch on it that's made of animal hide. It keeps trying to grab at you and then point down to its pouch.

[Speaker 4]
I'll open the pouch. What's in the pouch?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing. The thing has been... The bottom of it has been torn open at some point.

The boggart looks down and immediately begins freaking out.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no! I can mend that for you. Right here.

I'll sew it.

[Speaker 1]
He's besides himself.

[Speaker 3]
And just goes... Zzzzzt!

[Speaker 1]
Poor thing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you lost something!

[Speaker 1]
He nods his mask very vigorously.

[Speaker 4]
Where did they run from?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Is anybody able to do a little bit of tracking here?

[Speaker 3]
That's survival, right?

[Speaker 1]
That would be survival.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Is my survival any good?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's decent. Yours is much better. So the boggarts didn't really leave a great trail behind, but the boar sure did.

They're just like an absolute path of destruction. At this point, the boggarts are ready to... Boggarts are ready to continue on.

They have subdued their boar. They have constructed at this point not just a saddle, but what's known as a halter. It's kind of like a carriage that sits on top of a large beast of burden.

In the real world, it's basically only used on elephants. But in a fantasy setting, you can put it on any number of things.

[Speaker 4]
They're hard at work. Yes. Sure.

You can't let them leave without their friend's stuff. Yeah. Marissa will start tracking and seeing if she sees anything.

Can anyone entertain these boggarts so that they don't run off?

[Speaker 2]
I guess I can. When he suggests that, he's just like, alright. Minor illusion of prestidigitation for the win.

Just a bunch of lovely shows. Ooh. TV focus.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, so Mimosa takes the party down the trail and finds the first item that's sort of worth noting here. It looks like a golden crest that's meant to fit over a roughly humanoid head. And it fans outwards and has a number of painted...

It's gold. Anything that's not gold has been painted or dyed in some way. Ah.

Basically, it's just a fan outwards, so it's like a half-crescent circle. It goes... Yeah, it's a half-circle that fans out from the forehead.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, that's pretty cool. Pick it up.

[Speaker 1]
About ten minutes later, you'll find a scarab that's been constructed in a similar fashion. It has more black tones to it, but it looks as if it was meant to clasp a cloak or either a cloak or armor or saddle.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Take that up to me.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, you looking around, you can see two paths forward. One goes into a kind of a hovel or cave structure, like a tunnel, that just kind of... There's like a hump in the earth in between you and the tower, where the tower eventually will be.

And one of them is just... So there's a trail that goes around and to the left of this hill, and then there's a tunnel that goes straight through. It looks like the boggarts did go through that tunnel at some point, but it's not where the boar took them.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she's gonna follow the path of the boar.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alrighty. Kibi, at this point, I want you to make me a history check.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, okay. History... History...

Oh no. This is gothic. 13, please?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Yeah, it's not a terribly difficult thing. This is a normal 5e, where everything has to be a DC 27.

This is a baldergast 3, where medium is actually medium difficulty. Oh yeah. Yay.

You look over the next vine, which is a black pyramid scale.

[Speaker 7]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
Which looks quite like the ones that compose the hilt of your present sword. Oh. Greatsword, specifically.

[Speaker 4]
If I put them together, does it do anything?

[Speaker 1]
It does have a slight magnetic effect, and you feel a little bit of a tingling when you do this.

[Speaker 4]
You're not there. She's just playing with it now.

[Speaker 1]
Because we who are looking at Phoebe can see some of her hair is sticking up.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. If I put my hand on the very tips of her fur, do they follow my hand? They do.

[Speaker 4]
Like when you rubbed it with a balloon. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I used to be able to do that all the time. I was very static electricity.

[Speaker 4]
You get that part of the year where everything you touch shocks you, or you shock everything you touch?

[Speaker 5]
I don't shock things that often, which is thankfully. But my mom and I both kill watches. Ooh.

Is that a thing?

[Speaker 2]
Can I check up what's up with the weird crown thing and the scarab? Is that an arcana check to see what's their deal?

[Speaker 3]
Did we find all the pieces?

[Speaker 1]
Those are the ones at... Oh! Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I think we...

[Speaker 1]
The boggart looks pretty satisfied with everything they've found so far. And they're just kind of like pointing and pointing and pointing and pointing outwards. Not towards the tower, but towards the left of the tower a little bit.

[Speaker 4]
I don't understand. Does any of you understand us? Does anyone understand Sylvan?

Oh, yes, I do.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, good. Oh, I probably should have mentioned that. Yes.

That and...

[Speaker 1]
They're just kind of like making toddler noises right now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so...

[Speaker 1]
They're getting like... They could do like single syllable words basically that they know. So they're shouting like DEAD.

DEAD. DEAD. DEAD.

DEAD? DEAD. TREE.

DEAD. TREE. DEAD TREE.

Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
I relay this to the rest of the party being like, well...

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
One of the boggarts at this point like stands up because most of them have just been like lounging around in exhaustion and one of them stands up and kind of like sticks its arms out forward like this and just starts like shambling.

[Speaker 7]
Oh. Oh. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
And I sort of just well, I didn't, I haven't put them down but I just sort of gestured to the undead like that.

[Speaker 1]
Dead.

[Speaker 3]
Would they like help in clearing out the dead?

[Speaker 1]
Boggarts are just like staring at you guys.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe we could have them follow us. Like they're probably like doing something but if they're if, what if we, what if what we're doing aligns with what they're doing slightly well maybe we could bring them along with us. That's, that's to the tower?

Or at least that way. See where they split off from. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
The more the merrier.

[Speaker 2]
More the merrier.

[Speaker 1]
The uh, all the um, let's see here. A crow flies in to the boggarts and lands and it kind of looks like it like whispers in the boggarts' ear and then it flies off and all the boggarts are like turned towards one direction at the moment. But they do start following you.

[Speaker 3]
Weird. What is happening?

[Speaker 2]
I feel like supposed No, don't go I was going to say it feels cozy and it's fine. Would we have been able to hear what the crow says? Does comprehend language comprehend crows?

[Speaker 6]
I think you need to speak with animals for that.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, pity. But they are, but the boggarts understood, so.

[Speaker 1]
By the way, you were going to make an arcana check. Go ahead and make that real quick. Or no, you want to make a history check, or you want to make an arcana check I'd say history for this one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. History it is. That was decent.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, as a necromancer you're familiar with a certain lot of pre, not pre-civilization, but like first civilization peoples in the, on the planet, had a pretty similar kind of, pretty similar getup as this. There was a lot of gold bands that were applied primarily desert or nomadic peoples kind of like Fertile Crescent style areas that wore again, mostly armbands jewels, gold or things that were painted to look gold and would focus on a style of clothing that was primarily focused on like rings and how you could adorn those.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, Kibi would love that. That kind of style, it's very Khajiit.

[Speaker 1]
So, what is the party deciding on right now?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I assumed we are going to check out the dead by the tree and the tower. Yeah, let's help them out.

[Speaker 3]
If we help them out, they'll probably tell us where they're getting their goodies at.

[Speaker 5]
Like crows. Yeah. Well, crows do like shiny things.

They do. And they will give you shit if you give them peanuts.

[Speaker 4]
They will. Absolutely will. It's my dream.

My dad has already started doing that with squirrels. Aww. Your squirrels there are spoiled.

[Speaker 3]
They know it. They demand it.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, so we help with the tree. The dead tree. Tree with the dead.

[Speaker 1]
Tree with the dead. So, you'll begin moving along here. Let me draw a little bit bigger.

Let's fix that. There we go. Much better.

Go to the forest, go ahead and place yourselves on the bottom left-hand corner.

[Speaker 2]
Just a quick question. Do I have to dump all of the undead I have?

[Speaker 1]
Is it not necessary for this one? Are you just like walking around with a bunch of undead?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because animate undead is less costly if they're already raised. Because you only need one for 24 hours. So you can even sleep in between that.

[Speaker 6]
Give them all big cloaks to wear.

[Speaker 2]
That's the plan.

[Speaker 6]
These are just my friends.

[Speaker 2]
Don't mind their ghastly complexions.

[Speaker 5]
They just need a little skin care, it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Give them a facial, they'll be good in a week. And yes, also part of the reason is because of the whole double A line having been there for that whole time. Even cheaper to cast it.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so you can sustain it a little easier. So once we get to this area, we're missing somebody. Oh, we need Perah on the map.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that explains why I can't see. I thought I was on the map. Because I could see.

Uh, where am I?

[Speaker 3]
Bottom left. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
This is a pretty map. It is, I love this one.

[Speaker 4]
I want to be here, actually. Right, I'm going to swim in that water. I know there's dangers afoot.

Like, we're probably about to get, like, grabbed or something.

[Speaker 2]
But, I mean, it'd be peaceful.

[Speaker 1]
Right here? Okay. That works.

So you'll see a bunch of dryads running, basically, out of the I'm placing here, running out of the woods here, kind of, like, limping. And split up on either side, and begin, like, they've got labored breathing, they're hugging the wall very, very tightly, just, uh, basically as much as they can possibly manage.

[Speaker 4]
There are trees dying.

[Speaker 1]
Something following them. It is, you can see the sound of thundering hooves.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Oh, yeah, what happened to our horse guy?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, what did happen to our horse guy? Uh, they're not here today. What?

He said they've just been basically caring for the caravan, and, uh, since y'all took, like, an extended period of time there, they're currently not Tiana, but whoever the druid is, is currently basically just taking care of the caravan, making sure they don't, like, die spontaneously.

[Speaker 5]
Well, yeah, but there was an awakened, like, Slefnir?

[Speaker 1]
Awakened, like, seven-legged horse. Eight-legged freak. Uh, yeah, Anzor could be here.

That's reasonable.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so... My mouse is gonna... She's gonna...

I really want to be a monk and be able to run across that water, but... She's just gonna go for it. How deep does the water look?

[Speaker 1]
It looks about... It's pretty shallow.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
But, actually, make your perception check.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, is it pretty shallow for a normal-height human, or...? I wouldn't care.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just gonna run and help.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it's about a foot deep in most places across, but everywhere you see lily pads is actually about six feet deep.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I have to go, like...

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunate for anyone who's six feet below, I guess.

[Speaker 4]
How far... How far is it? Hold on.

I don't... I don't suppose we could jump up here and just leap our way across.

[Speaker 1]
It is now time for people to begin rolling initiatives.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Before or after we cross the river?

[Speaker 5]
I think before. Okay. Oh.

Okay, I see what those are. That's how deep they are.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I was like, why are you putting a bunch of minus six...

[Speaker 1]
The centaur mummies are currently galloping towards you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy. We're gonna start screaming at them. Hey!

Over here! Buddy! Let's get their attention.

[Speaker 5]
There's no encounter. Oh, there we are. Wait.

[Speaker 2]
Centaur mummy. That is... Honestly, a fascinating mix.

Ooh, there. That's a lot of mummies.

[Speaker 3]
Decent.

[Speaker 5]
To be at the bottom of initiative yet again.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no. Oh, there's a way.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 7]
Time for...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so first up on the encounter is Rana. I'm gonna have these dryads go at initiative 20. Good for them.

[Speaker 6]
Rana will move.

[Speaker 1]
Gary? Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 6]
She's just moving and she'll turn on her halo with her bonus action. For her action, she'll cast... They're present on the map at 420, right?

Mm-hmm. She'll cast Hold the Dead on the top left. Needs to make a wisdom save.

[Speaker 1]
It is immune to necrotic damage. There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, that's good to know.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 6]
I'll end my turn. I'll put my light on so you know where my halo aura is.

[Speaker 1]
Well done. Thank you. That's good.

Okay, so the... Yeah. Okay, so the dryads kind of retreat over into these trees they haven't been seen yet.

And they are going to start tossing a... You see both sides toss like a rope in air. And it connects and kind of like winds itself around into a knot and turns invisible in there.

And the dryads, you can see a little bit of the rope that they're holding in their hand. They're getting ready to basically to... Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Where they're doing it at is actually... Yeah, these two guys would be... The back two would be covered in it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Where exactly are the dryads? They're a little bit side.

They're matchy. Ah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
They blend.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, I had to...

[Speaker 4]
I thought those were bushes for a second. Now that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. But that's their turn, so it is up to Kibi.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi is going to rage. She's gonna scream a random name and get really angry.

[Speaker 1]
What weapon does Kibi have out right now?

[Speaker 4]
Well, probably the sword. Um... Yeah, the sword, because she would have been playing with the thing on...

Yeah. Um... Sword of Mose Gangster.

[Speaker 1]
The, uh... All the...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that sword.

[Speaker 1]
All of them are currently pointing at you.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Um... Uh...

I'm gonna point back and... Okay, hold on. So the six...

That's minus six feet. Um... Is this gonna half my...

[Speaker 1]
So if you go into a spot that's only minus... Only minus one, then you're not gonna have to worry about... If you go into a spot that's six feet deep, then it's going to, like...

You're gonna fall beneath the water.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so like this little... This little part here can just, like, mosey my way on, right?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. But you could, like... You could jump over it.

That'd be easy. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
How far can I jump?

[Speaker 1]
It's three times your strength bonus, so...

[Speaker 3]
I love that you pointed at them, and now you're leaping through the water at them.

[Speaker 4]
She's serious. Uh-huh. My strength bonus, you said?

[Speaker 6]
Equal to your strength score. Equal to your strength score, so... The long jump.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, eighteen.

[Speaker 4]
Thirty feet... Wait.

[Speaker 1]
That's gonna carry you well over it. You're good. It's just a matter of where you want to jump to.

Yeah, that's good.

[Speaker 4]
Right here? Yeah, okay. You're gonna go there.

[Speaker 1]
Um... And you still have, I think, ten feet of movement left?

[Speaker 4]
I do. Fifteen.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, barbarian.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I can't do any... Uh, hmm.

[Speaker 1]
You can hold your action if you're...

[Speaker 4]
Can I throw a javelin?

[Speaker 1]
You can.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna throw a javelin.

[Speaker 1]
You do have the option of holding your action whenever something's not in range.

[Speaker 4]
Well, then I'll do that. Yeah, I'll hold my sword ready. And that'll end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. There we go. That brings us to Mimosa.

[Speaker 3]
That was all the minus one, right? Like, within here?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Yeah, almost this way.

[Speaker 3]
I guess I will take a bonus action to... the last bit. Do I want to do that?

Yes. Actually, no. Meh.

I'm gonna throw my dagger up. Do I have to do anything different if I want to throw it?

[Speaker 5]
You'll have to go pick it up after.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well, that's fine. Heh heh heh. But I don't have to do any extra rolls.

[Speaker 5]
Um... Wouldn't throwing a dagger make it a dex roll, not a... Actually, you're a rogue.

Does it change it?

[Speaker 1]
It's a finesse, so you can still do it with dexterity.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so I don't think it would change anything if she's throwing the dagger?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, she can throw it.

[Speaker 5]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Weapon bounces to two targets within ten feet of the original when thrown, dealing its damage at the initial time. What a pity.

[Speaker 3]
Eleven doesn't do it, does it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, an eleven does... not.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Well, you hear her swear. But now she's got to go find her damn dagger.

[Speaker 1]
It bounces... Basically, the centaur bumby hits it back at you, and it's going to land right about here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Now, you had to use your bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I did. Oh, I know I didn't! Okay.

I wrote it off because I was going to dash, but I didn't dash, so yes, I will... Well, we'll see if they'll be played again.

[Speaker 1]
Fifteen hits! The armor class is... thirteen.

And... All right, so... The first one takes seven.

The second one takes... seven, and then an additional three. And then the third one takes...

seven, and an additional four.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, they all took damage just hitting one. Because it bounces.

[Speaker 5]
It bounces.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, mine bounces? Yeah. Okay.

No, I'm... I was using the plus one, but...

[Speaker 1]
The weapon bounces to two targets within ten feet.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. They both bounce, remember?

[Speaker 3]
They both awakened? No, I don't remember that. But we're good!

That's cool!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the weapon deals an additional damage for every creature it hits until the beginning of your next turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So if you throw it and it hits one guy, and that would also hit two other guys, you get like the first...

[Speaker 3]
I should have been throwing these so long ago!

[Speaker 1]
It's okay!

[Speaker 5]
Oh, cool. Happens.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Centaur Mummy is gonna approach Keebee.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, we get a water fight. Splashy.

[Speaker 1]
Very much so.

[Speaker 4]
So my held action... Yes? Can I use that as soon as it gets close to me?

[Speaker 1]
You can. That's basically... Exactly.

[Speaker 4]
Fourteen?

[Speaker 1]
Fourteen hits! These things only have an AC of thirteen.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. Eight. Um...

How do I... How does one go about getting advantage on targets?

[Speaker 1]
Well, the easiest way for you is doing reckless attacks. Also, tagging a creature that's prone will do it.

[Speaker 5]
Or whenever I squeak.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, also that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's funny. Um, all right. Uh...

Okay. Oh, I have an extra attack. Hold on.

[Speaker 6]
You don't get that on a reaction.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I don't? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
No. Oh, extra attack doesn't apply to... It's on your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Held actions? What the fuck?

Nope. Shit. Okay, so it's gonna attack with its pike first and then its hooves.

There's a hit. It didn't move at least twenty feet so it's not gonna get the benefit of the charge. And then it's going to attempt the hooves.

Okay, go ahead and make me a constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
I'm a saving throw. How much have I lost already? Boom.

[Speaker 1]
So you do take the necrotic damage.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, how close is she actually? Oh, she's five feet out of my radius.

[Speaker 4]
Damn it.

[Speaker 1]
So this is a curse.

[Speaker 4]
That makes sense. What's Kiwi's curse now? She's got multiple.

Well, not literally. Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Right now it is the... I see what my wording trouble is now. Okay.

Right, so your hit point maximum is temporarily reduced by... And there's a spot on your character sheet for temporary maximum hit points?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, if you look under your actual maximum, you can put like minus and then whatever that...

[Speaker 1]
Which is a total of seventeen because I rolled two sixes and a fucking five.

[Speaker 4]
Minus seventeen, got it.

[Speaker 1]
And that brings us to Baysha.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, how much did I take? Oh. How much did I take originally?

[Speaker 1]
Damage-wise. The grand total was twenty-nine.

[Speaker 4]
Twenty-nine?

[Speaker 1]
Okay. That's with the seventeen.

[Speaker 4]
Five damage.

[Speaker 7]
Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Just wondering, can you use shape water to freeze someone in water? I don't believe so. ...

[Speaker 1]
I think shape water is... If you tag it inside the... Oh, yeah, let me do that.

[Speaker 6]
You freeze the water provided there are no creatures in it.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. Kiwi's just fucking everything up here. That's a shame.

But would I be able to try and, I don't know, trip up the centaur by freezing the water in front of it? Just a bit. Is there a gap between you two?

[Speaker 6]
Well, it's only a five-foot cube so you could do like here or here next to it.

[Speaker 1]
I could make a wall of sorts. Yeah, yeah, if they tried to run on top of the ice that would probably mess it up. Horses do not like walking on ice.

[Speaker 4]
Can you make it stair-shaped? Because I don't think they can get upstairs either.

[Speaker 1]
Of course, use the elevator.

[Speaker 2]
Can I then hold it so that whenever someone tries to move on it I can turn it into ice on them?

[Speaker 6]
That sounds like fun.

[Speaker 2]
Very cool. Would anyone benefit from a help action by any chance?

[Speaker 6]
You wouldn't be able to use your help action and cause the cells to react.

[Speaker 2]
That is true, but I do have an owl the familiar, which I think can do that.

[Speaker 6]
Is it ready to die?

[Speaker 2]
It's okay. It'll only take ten minutes to bring it back. You'll be fine.

[Speaker 1]
I thought Kibi was looking for advantage earlier.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And Mimosa could use her dagger's return.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yes I can. So, uh... So who wants help action?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to have this centaur mummy go by the way. I'm going to have this one move.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine. If you want to pick up my daggers... Can the bird do that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the bird can grab the daggers. That's totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
Please imagine that the bird is... Oh, that explains why I'm not doing anything. Okay.

Please imagine the bird has gone and grabbed the daggers for you. It's flown all the way. Oh, you're so sweet.

And now it's... I guess it's here now. Because it's given you back your daggers.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to use pike on Mimosa for 21 to hit.

[Speaker 7]
Ugh. Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
13 piercing damage.

[Speaker 7]
Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
Are you going to use uncanny dodge on this one?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. It's just going to ask. I'd like to do that.

[Speaker 1]
And then I need you to make me a DC12 wisdom saving throw against being frightened.

[Speaker 3]
DC... What am I rolling? Wisdom.

Okay. It's right there. You can also click it, I think.

It's a button. Yeah, that's what I just said. Oh no!

I'd like to use a hero point.

[Speaker 1]
I can give you inspiration from the boggarts No, I'm still good. I haven't released a PDF yet but that's the intention of the hirelings doc going forward so if you would like to re-roll you're free to do so. Sure.

[Speaker 6]
Boggart just comes in, takes the hit for you.

[Speaker 4]
Um, how... Get down, Mrs. Boggart. Have I already used my reaction?

I've already used my reaction when I did my... Oh, that's even easier. Yeah.

Why is that my luck?

[Speaker 3]
I hate that.

[Speaker 1]
One of these centaurs is going to go prone. The other one's going to quite deftly dodge and it's going to run over here and attack the dryad.

[Speaker 4]
Oh no.

[Speaker 6]
I got the dryads!

[Speaker 4]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. The 25 hits. But the 16 didn't.

Alright, that's all of their turns. We come now to Parah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Is it just half speed to swim across deeper bits of water?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Unless you have a swim speed.

[Speaker 7]
...

[Speaker 5]
are in fact very far away. Um... And these are very easy.

Okay, how far can I go? I can go up to here. And then I can...

target this guy and guiding bolt him. Do I want to guiding bolt him? Uh...

I'm going to guiding bolt this one. He's more likely to get hit the next turn. I have guiding bolted him.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus. This is, uh, this one up here, right?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, the one in front of Kibi, actually.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Apply damage. Does not look great.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, and now whoever hits him next has advantage, so... Oh! The next, okay, yeah, the next only one attack.

Not as fun as my squeaks. Uh, and I believe that is all I can do for now.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Kibi, uh, you can see another wave of critters is coming down the way. It looks to be a bunch of skeletons and shambling mummies. They are not going to be here until round three.

Rhonda, if you'd stop the round for you.

[Speaker 6]
Rhonda swims ten feet out. She'll use her bonus action to activate her shield, uh, her animated shield. She'll spend her action, this time, causing sacred flame.

Radiant spell on this one, next to Kibi. Very good. Needs to make a deck save.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it was unlikely to make that.

[Speaker 6]
Makes the 18 radiant damage, and that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Radiant damage it is. That brings us to Kibi.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Kibi, um, is gonna use the sword.

[Speaker 5]
And you have advantage. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
So that means, Warsong, whenever you make an attack at advantage, you roll with an additional 1d12 for damage. Okay. Too bad we don't have a bard.

Uh, plus 1d12? Plus 1d12, right. Or does it already take that?

[Speaker 1]
For damage.

[Speaker 4]
Do I have to roll another one?

[Speaker 1]
You do have to, um, add a... What do you mean? That was your attack roll.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, shit, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You roll the d12 for damage. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And then... Damage, plus 1d12. Uh...

2. And then one more attack. 6 damage.

[Speaker 1]
That is just barely enough to kill it. You had 18 hit points left. Yes.

Alright. Where to next?

[Speaker 4]
Um... I'm gonna move out of this water, first of all. Um...

I'll go here. And I think that's all I can do, unless I can shove this guy. But I think he's a bit too big.

[Speaker 1]
Now you are pretty strong. It's a large creature, but you are pretty strong.

[Speaker 5]
I was gonna say you could have Titan Wrestler, but that's, uh, that's also path.

[Speaker 6]
He's only one size bigger. I think you're allowed to shove him, still.

[Speaker 2]
Well, then I'll do that.

[Speaker 4]
Unless it's like, is that a bonus action?

[Speaker 6]
It's not a bonus action, it's an attack.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well then, I'm good.

[Speaker 6]
How dare Baldur's Gate make the game good?

[Speaker 1]
Right?

[Speaker 3]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, Brian's gonna cast Entangle. And these other ones are also going to cast Entangle, and they're just gonna keep casting Entangle until... They should do Plant Growth next.

I'm playing a druid in, fucking, in Baldur's Gate 3, and I was gonna... ...

[Speaker 4]
My first D&D character was Dryad.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that one is destroyed. Alright, so, Mimosa, I'm just gonna do some additional rolls in the background here, but Mimosa and Dr. Basha are up.

[Speaker 2]
The one that goes before me is dead. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Does this one go, or is that after me?

[Speaker 1]
The guy in front of you is... does not go until after you.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, alright, alright. Then I'm gonna go somewhere else. Because I can't.

And I could attack everybody.

[Speaker 1]
He is restrained, so you have advantage.

[Speaker 3]
So then it would cancel out because I have disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
Why do you have disadvantage? Oh wait, no, you're paralyzed right now.

[Speaker 3]
Am I paralyzed?

[Speaker 1]
No, paralyzed.

[Speaker 3]
Fuck, okay. Well, we're both paralyzed together, so she, like, tries to flip him the bird.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, why is Mimosa paralyzed?

[Speaker 3]
Because my saving roll sucked, and the cool inspiration got me a worse number than...

[Speaker 2]
Can you do the saving throw again, or are you still, um... It's only until the end of his turn, so.

[Speaker 3]
So next round I'll be good.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
And I'm within touching distance, so if she gets paralyzed again, I can undo it.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, sorry about that.

[Speaker 2]
That's so fast. That's fine. The owl's gonna go help Katie this time.

Distract. Just distract. And, um...

Me, myself? Well... Just...

Easy enough, then. Magic missile to the face. The guy is currently accosting the dryads.

[Speaker 1]
That's a real thing.

[Speaker 2]
Let me go cast that.

[Speaker 1]
I have this guy attempt to attack Mimosa. Does this just be a regular roll?

[Speaker 3]
Trying to slap each other. No!

[Speaker 1]
Is it 19 hit?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah! Um... What's your...

Mimosa, what's your DC, just real quick? AC, sorry. 16.

[Speaker 4]
I haven't used my reaction, so that means I can reduce the damage. Are you within range?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think I am. There's a critical hit, by the way, by virtue of being a... Oh.

I can negate the critical pun. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Cool. Thank you, guys. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That brings it down to... That would bring it down to 14. And then Kibi's spirit shield would bring that further down by 10.

[Speaker 3]
So you take 4 damage.

[Speaker 1]
A grand total of 4 damage.

[Speaker 4]
These are wonderful. Can you imagine being a player and the enemies doing all of that? You see your critical is just 4 damage.

Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi reacts to that information. And then he's gonna use his... He gets a dryad here to try to paralyze it.

It works! Aw!

[Speaker 3]
Bloody hell. Same.

[Speaker 2]
Just a quick thing. Um... The other centaur mummy takes 13 damage.

That was from the magic missile.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Perfect. Well done.

Brings us to... That guy already went. This one is still restrained and prone.

And this one is sitting next to Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm no longer paralyzed.

[Speaker 1]
That is correct. You are no longer paralyzed. Yes.

Alright. So it's just gonna... You know what?

It's just gonna attack. Yeah, there's 12 here.

[Speaker 4]
Who? Me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you. Kibi did a reckless attack.

[Speaker 4]
12? I don't think so. Yeah, no.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi did a reckless attack last time. Kibi had advantage from guiding bolt. But that second attack wasn't mega with advantage.

Gotcha, gotcha. It's going to attempt a hoof attack against Dryad here. Which also fucking misses.

Not his day. Okay, that brings us to Para.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty. Do I wanna get that close? I have to.

I'm gonna get right behind Mimosa and I'm gonna squeak.

[Speaker 3]
Yay! Get squeaked.

[Speaker 5]
And... might as well do a sacred flame on that guy as well.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Oh, that was close. That was gonna be a happy man.

Okay. Anything else for Para's turn?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, nope.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that brings us to Rana.

[Speaker 6]
She will keep swimming and she will cast a sacred flame again on the top left guy.

[Speaker 1]
Any vulnerable to... No, just fire. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Rana's turn's done.

[Speaker 1]
All right. That brings us to Kibi.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi. Um, well, of course I have to... I gotta whack him.

I'll do that again. All right. 11 and 15.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yep, that kills him by one. And...

25 hit points left. He too is now toast.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Actually, I'm gonna be a little closer. Yeah, okay.

And that'll be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, one with Brian's is gonna cast entangle again just to further fuck that guy. And another one is going to...

[Speaker 2]
As they should. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Take this one.

[Speaker 4]
Spell is the bane of my existence in Baldur's Gate 1. So bad.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that brings us to Mimosa. That's also going to cast. All right, you have Venge on the attack.

Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. Nice. Oh!

Whoa. I think he might have killed him. Just a little bit.

Is that a record? Hold on.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, man. You got a 19 and then a 20. How good.

[Speaker 2]
Take a screenshot of it to save. Just, you know. To look back on this moment.

[Speaker 3]
A little bit mad. Just a little bit mad.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, I'm going to take a screenshot of that. That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
I've taken a screenshot. That's fucking great.

[Speaker 3]
Um, let's see. And that one's... I'm going to throw my dagger at that one.

[Speaker 5]
You do advantage on that one, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I just didn't know if I got kind of a sneak attack since I wasn't there.

[Speaker 4]
There's more undead on the way, right?

[Speaker 1]
That is correct. 17 hits. Let's see here.

Okay. That brings us to Dr. Batia. One enemy on the board, but more are coming.

Oh, yeah. It, uh... does not succeed.

[Speaker 3]
Is that a cantrip, right? What level are you at?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry. I realized I was muted.

I was talking this whole time. What I was trying to say was that due to failing the throw or whatever, he gets two psychic damage and removes three from his next psychic, you know, saving throw. You were asking what level I am at.

I'm still at 8, but I have an arcane item that makes my DCs annoying.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I was just thinking because cantrips level up with you, so you should have done...

[Speaker 2]
It did deal. No, no, no. I'm level...

Oh, it did?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, I'm C. Okay, hang on. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It was just trash on the deck.

[Speaker 5]
Also, I like how the spell got half-posted with that image, James. Range of a really good crit.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. Oh, wait, no, because it uses action.

[Speaker 2]
I read it.

[Speaker 1]
He's just chilling there.

[Speaker 2]
The bird is now helping Kibi. Or anyone else who needs help. Just to have advantage, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, well. Good to know.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. I'm gonna do... Let's see.

Nope, that doesn't do what I thought it did. Oh, it's this one that I'm thinking of. How big is that?

Hang on, I'm gonna... I need to circle O. O.

Um. Hmm. Are you casting Fireball?

Uh, not quite. Yeah, I could do it there. I could do a little dawn.

Ooh. Okay. Oh, okay.

It gave me another one. Blip.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's... That's very unfortunate. These guys take damage as part of moving into the...

Oh, um, I have to have them make saves. Okay, uh, one of them does not die. And I need my Skeletons on here.

Anything else you'd like to do with your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Um. This one's... Hang on.

This one's still up, right? The Centaur mobby?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it is.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It did take a hefty chunk of damage.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna move under the bird, and I'm gonna squeak him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. The Skeletons would also just get annihilated. Actually, no.

Wait, no, I... Okay, I'm just gonna have him make, uh, save a whole bunch. Alright, so you squeaked the, uh, the dude?

[Speaker 5]
Yep, he squeaked.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then... He did the lane like this, but... Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Just go roll six times, and whoever makes it through...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I love that! You lost someone.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Heart, um, got obliterated. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Where'd she go?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she did.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, does anybody know what happened?

[Speaker 3]
No? Probably, I'm guessing her connection since she had said that her connection got lost a while ago.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, at 10pm, lost connection for a sec, one moment, I'm guessing that happened again. Just for a little more than one moment. Hey!

Heart's back.

[Speaker 3]
Hello. Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Welcome back. Thank you. My computer died.

Oh. I have that problem, too.

[Speaker 3]
I've gotten better. Honestly, I'll get me enough.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that brings us to Rana.

[Speaker 6]
Well, as Peridot mentioned, that guy is still alive. I'll cast a first-level Guiding Bolt. It does get heightened to second-level because of my Halo, my Book of Exalted Deeds.

[Speaker 5]
Nice! And you have advantage. Not that you need it.

Unless you want a fish crit.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'll fish. 19. Bad.

That was close.

[Speaker 1]
That was close. Alright, what's the damage? 15.

Alrighty. I'll move. It has literally one hit point left.

Does it take damage from Dawn at the beginning of its turn?

[Speaker 5]
At the end.

[Speaker 1]
At the end of its turn. Okay. That is my turn.

That brings us to Kibi. You have advantage on this attack.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. And then this next attack, I'm guessing I don't have advantage on the next one?

[Speaker 5]
Well, because the mummy only has one hit point.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if you hit it, which you did, it just dies.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, wonderful.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, you would have advantage if you chose to hit it again. Nothing can stop me, really.

[Speaker 4]
I'll hit this one.

[Speaker 5]
I do believe that would mean that Dawn would hit you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. I'm not afraid of some sunlight. Come on.

I'm laying it constantly.

[Speaker 6]
Let's get out of it before the end of your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah. That'll give them a reaction, but that's fine. I can take it.

I can handle it. I'm a big girl. Attack.

[Speaker 6]
We witnessed Kibi get eaten by a dinosaur.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on.

[Speaker 6]
Would you like to let Kibi go?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. No, actually. Why not?

Uh... Oh, he almost got you. He did.

I'm very easy.

[Speaker 1]
Come on, you get extra damage off of it. You could kill him.

[Speaker 4]
I could.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 17 does hit. Oh, you kill him anyway. Alright, that's good.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right. Okay, we're good.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Mimosa. There are two fellas on the board right now. Oh, are you muted?

I'm back. Um... Hello.

[Speaker 3]
I am using the earbuds because my child absconded with my USB port for my headphones. So... Stop speaking.

I am... All I gotta do is be out of the sunshine. Yes.

[Speaker 5]
And that one is dead. Oh, okay. Ooh.

You always can throw.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's what I was saying. I'll just throw at the skeleton.

[Speaker 1]
If you throw it, it'll hit both the skeleton and the...

[Speaker 3]
Where on earth did I spawn? Yeah. This is what I will do.

[Speaker 7]
Nice!

[Speaker 3]
I'm assuming a 23 takes the zombie.

[Speaker 1]
It's both of these guys. Cool. And then go ahead and roll your damage a second time and add 1d4.

[Speaker 3]
Very good. That'll be my turn. Ah, wait, no, I have a second one.

I'll throw a second one.

[Speaker 1]
I was about to say, because something you can do in order to get easy advantage is to hide with your bonus action. Because your sneak attack will apply to all... If it applies to the one target, it'll apply to all of them.

Provided it would hit the other guys.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I guess I will go hide with the druids.

[Speaker 1]
That's something you would have done before the... Oh, okay. Before you throw the first one, because if you're hitting, you get advantage on your next attack.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was figuring I could if they're still alive next round, I'll hide this next round and then get the next one.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. These guys... Oh, there's still Dr. Basia.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Do you have your daggers on you, or do you need bird help again?

[Speaker 3]
I would like bird help, please.

[Speaker 2]
Bird help to the rescues.

[Speaker 3]
Make sure that they're dropped away from me so I can sneakily grab them.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Let's... Okay, let's see.

30 here. And then just... I guess I'll drop them here.

So you can reach them. And that will get them out of the way. And I'll still be able to give someone help, since I'm not using a dash action on the bird.

Should I roll stealthy time? I mean, yeah. Kibi's closest once again, so there you go.

And once again, just making sure that they take the full amount of radiant damage, it's mine silver once again. Silver, once again. The bigger one.

I imagine that one has more health. Ow! Anywho.

Let's see. So, two of that. Minus four on its next saving throw.

And somehow only two psychic damage once again. I'm impressed it's that low again. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Just kill it. All that's left for this thing to do is be here. It is going to run over?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, just a quick question. I don't imagine it does, but remember that one hold action of if something goes into the wall, the water it gets slept on, does that still count? Or is it because it was multiple turns ago?

No.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I assume that the freeze stays for an hour, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
If you stepped up to the water's edge, you'd be in range to do just about any of the water.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. So you would just have to have been closer, but yeah, that would be fine for this thing. I'm going to have it make a make a deck save.

I'm going to have it fail. Still going to attempt to bite Para, but at disadvantage.

[Speaker 6]
I'm sorry, Para, I tried to throw aggro. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It's technically going to still work for this.

[Speaker 5]
That's okay, it doesn't hit anyway.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Alright, mummies to us, and now we're just a Para.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Well, this thing's getting squeaked.

[Speaker 1]
Squeaked. It has literally one hit point left. Wait, people already have advantage on it, because it's prone.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay, then I won't squeak it. I'll give myself that squeak back. Inhale really deeply.

And I guess I'll sacred flame it.

[Speaker 2]
As one does.

[Speaker 5]
That and his pathfinder in there. Even on a succeeded save for cantrips.

[Speaker 1]
I think clerks have a feature like that. I don't think I have one though. It evaporates.

Alright. For the moment, everybody is safe.

[Speaker 3]
Yippee.

[Speaker 5]
Do we need healing at all?

[Speaker 2]
Are we all good? I'm fine.

[Speaker 5]
Kibi has a curse, right?

[Speaker 1]
Speaking of which, Kibi, you're able to meditate on a short rest to remove that. There's something missing from the text, or unclarified in the text.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, she will state as such to be like, you know, I just need a short rest. Just a little break. A little lie down.

And then she lies down. Is meditation for Kibi sleeping? Maybe.

It's unclear. She seems like the kind to start meditating and then she just falls asleep instead. Yeah, there's too many voices to truly, truly focus on meditating.

But she could try.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, what's everybody doing right now? We got a short rest going on?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll just come back and chill here.

[Speaker 6]
Sure, I'll take a short rest.

[Speaker 2]
Heal up. I only have 10 hit points.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, jeez.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like you have the power of friendship saved me. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
I get channel divinity back on short rest, so I'm going to use harness divine power before we do getting a spell slot back.

[Speaker 2]
It's a shame I don't have any healing spells. That would have been quite useful. Um, do you need healing?

No, not for me, for you, the person who has... 10 hit points at the moment. I don't have 10 hit points.

[Speaker 3]
Well, for one person then. I need to make up 10 hit points which I did.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I thought someone was down to 10 hit points, and I was like, oh, that is concerning. I don't think anyone actually really took that much on this round set.

[Speaker 1]
Still breathing, despite everything. A parasite. Take it.

It might be useful. Can't slow down. What's inside?

More for me.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, how long does dawn last? Not that long, I don't think. Yeah, one min.

[Speaker 1]
There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I guess during the short rest I can go talk to the dryads and ask them where the undead came from.

[Speaker 5]
We're okay.

[Speaker 3]
How can we help them further? And we're also the undead cavemen.

[Speaker 5]
That's literally where the undead came from. Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Who's the eye who's ominously looking down on us?

[Speaker 5]
Whoa.

[Speaker 4]
That's spooky. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna be this too.

[Speaker 2]
There they go.

[Speaker 1]
I do that on occasion. I have no idea why.

[Speaker 4]
They're just observing. I guess so. It's spooky, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 6]
Plutonium import time. Love that shit.

[Speaker 1]
So, the short rest is going to pass uneventfully. What is this? Oh, the undead distinctly closer to the tower now.

The road down the tower is currently occupied by a small camp of mummies and attendants undead. The dryads have been just kind of silently watching you for the moment, trying to figure out what it is that you're here for.

[Speaker 2]
Could we try chatting with them? Just be like, so...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, sorry. What was that? You all talked at the same time.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sorry. I was asking if we could just chat about why the camp attacked and when they came. And also, since they're wondering why we're here, we can easily just tell them.

[Speaker 1]
Right? Yes. Those bearing the spider's mark approached from the tower.

Oh! A couple of weeks ago. Harrying our forces regularly, we've been ambushing them in kind, but there's this life that keeps turning outwards from the tower and turning the nice loam of the forest to sand and desiccating our trees.

The tower has never done this before.

[Speaker 2]
That is very unfortunate. Hmm. When did this start?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, about... I want to say about ten days ago.

[Speaker 7]
Huh.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we are going to go look into the tower. Yeah, let's go do this.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Perrow's just going to offer a primal herb to one of, uh, two. Yeah, they can have a primal herb. Sign of goodwill.

Herb for your troubles. Oh, wait. Yes, we are towering.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, we'll go look into the tower. We're headed in there.

[Speaker 1]
You're coming in, is there a specific way that you're a specific reason that you're coming in for?

[Speaker 4]
Everyone looks at Mimosa. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Smiles, like, oh, yeah, well my grandmother is associated with that tower. She was the snake.

That means anything to you?

[Speaker 1]
The tower bears the mark of a snake. The painting of it likes to...painting and tiles like to move around on the tower on occasion. They've been much more active recently.

We don't know what its specific meaning is, though. Come to think of it, there was someone like you who passed through this area quite some time ago. Did you say it was your grandmother?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I see.

[Speaker 2]
Was that odd?

[Speaker 1]
This isn't really inhabited by mortals.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! She was only here for a time. She was an adventurer.

She was quite lucky.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. The tower existed here before she did, but she did something to it. It was like a...

It was as if a wish had struck it. As a bolt of fire and sand from the sky and struck the top of the tower and now it's just been a place of magic and a place of peace for the longest time. It's foreign to our lands, but we let it stand.

But until recently, it's just been peaceful. The one who came through here had a tote that was carrying a body. It was wrapped not quite identically to the wrapped undead that you see out here, but a relatively similar style, if not the same material.

[Speaker 3]
Did you say the woman had the body?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, the one you call your grandmother. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. It was wrapped like the dead people you see here. Was it moving?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Alright. So, there are these spiritual beings.

Tell them the tale. So that could have been her twin. Twin?

Yeah, the like, not prophecy, but the the tale, the legend was the spider and the snake spirits or whatever they were. And the snake was born into twins and one of them was my grandmother.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I guess that's a guess. I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
We could figure out a way to... I believe that we can help you. There's a cave not too far away from here that we could take you to.

She stayed there for a short while.

[Speaker 3]
I would absolutely love that. And any information we can find on the tower, we got information that going through a certain door or a level will teleport us somewhere far away.

[Speaker 4]
It was the entire first floor, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, there's a teleporting effect at the base of it. Triads who have gone through have returned.

[Speaker 3]
I would like all the information on my grandmother you have, please.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, indeed. Alright, folks, give me about like a five minute break here. I'm gonna fix something up here.

Just grab a drink.

[Speaker 7]
There we go.

[Speaker 6]
If I was holding anything up, I have returned.

[Speaker 7]
Don't worry about it. That's true.

[Speaker 1]
I'll just type in, keep going. You guys are free to say, hey, like I wanna move this along at any time. Alright, so the Triads are gonna take y'all to the cave.

It's the same one you guys saw earlier. It's the one with the soul fires. Yeah, there's this guy here who's been causing a lot of trouble recently.

It's been really frustrating. As you guys go deeper and deeper in, the Triads basically say we were asked never to go further than this, so we haven't, and we've made sure that nobody else has. It was just long enough ago that we had to remember over time.

Make sure that you're the one who goes first, Mimosa.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Two folks continue walking in and further and further in. And the loam of the cave turns to sand, but it's not the kind of desiccated life-sapping sand that you saw coming off the hooves of the mummy centaurs earlier. For instance, it's more of like that of an oasis.

There's water in here. Little rivers and veins spreading out between the native roots and this sand that's kind of layering over it. Think of it like a three-colored tapestry going all the way down.

It forms the sign of a two-headed serpent. As you go further in, it's pretty significant for a walk. Somebody spent a lot of time on this, or a lot of magic on it, or both.

So you eventually come to the two-headed, the two heads of the serpent, wrapping around a stone table marked with obsidian and turquoise, on which there is a rather small, wrapped body.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
I will go up to it and lightly touch the shoulder.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, thank goodness. Alright, was that excited enough? You said I should do, I should be encouraging for a magic mouth spell.

Oh, it's doing it now. Okay. Welcome, Kin.

I hope you're ready to take on the mantle of or, if indeed it's been passed down in this way. It wasn't always in our family, but we suspected it would be attached to one of us, so long as one of the sisters lived. And that's what the prophet said anyways, but pretty much every sage that we asked.

But the spell is only going to go off if one of our kin's folk is here and bears the mark of the serpent on their heart and if that's the case, congratulations and also we're terribly sorry for the long road ahead. If you are here, we suspect it means that the spider is active once again. By this point, the serpent's mark will have passed on to, well, someone other than us two.

But we didn't leave you unprepared. You'll find resources here provided, you know, you're not thieves or something of that variety. Just go ahead and scroll on the pedestals, what your need is, and they will provide.

Not often, of course. We didn't have unlimited supplies, but you can basically, anything that you can think of, we probably got for you. And also, my sister was better at keeping lists.

So, she'll have something of that sort. The spell just fades.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Hey. Magic mouth spell.

[Speaker 2]
Magic what spell? Magic mouth spell. They didn't say anything.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I guess within reason, but. At the back of the cave, a bunch of pedestals open up. There are four of them.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
And there's a small tablet on the back end there that mostly we're able to read. It actually specifically comes into, the words come into focus as you approach. Okay.

It says, Dear Kin, ask first and foremost for the dagger. This will be, you'll rely on it to defeat your foe in time. Seek the tower as best you can and defeat the evil within.

You'll find a representation of the spider to person your blade and to ensure that you really are worthy of our legacy. Perhaps we can someday defeat them once and for all. Additionally, there are a number of potions that we've made arrangements for potions to be produced for you.

The scroll-weaving spiders of Anlatu were more than willing to provide us with a number of them. But, seek first the dagger, and then as far as the rest of the supplies go just draw the rough image of it into the the rough image of it into the pedestal. For instance, if you wanted to get the dagger from one of these pedestals, you would just draw an image of a dagger and it would be provided to you.

Does that make sense?

[Speaker 3]
I'm picturing that on the margins of the actual message.

[Speaker 1]
Just in case somebody doesn't figure it out.

[Speaker 3]
Mimosa will nod like she's being told that. Okay, well. Yes, I will do that then.

Show up to the pedestal and convince that she draws a bad form of a dagger in the sand.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 2]
You do have three other pedestals to draw on, so I imagine you can get a couple more things. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I can.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. It's just down to what's actually in there. Let's see here.

Okay, so you have something that's made out of flint and obsidian. Just kind of rises up. It's in a very rough-hewn shape of a serpent, but has much finer, intricate details that look to have been carved later on.

[Speaker 3]
I will take it. Gently in my hand. This is a dream.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. The pommel has an empty socket for a gem, and every time you look at it out of your peripheral vision, it seems like it has a second blade going the opposite direction.

[Speaker 4]
The stuff that we got along the way, would it have anything to do with this?

[Speaker 3]
The crown and the scarab?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, also the my sword thing. Did that help us in any way?

[Speaker 3]
I thought my intelligence was minus one.

[Speaker 1]
You have two clerics, but you could use augury and other divination spells.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what other potions would be helpful in this situation, or if those things... Potion of Dragon Mastery? That's awesome.

Providing they have one. I don't... Potion of Dragon Mastery?

I don't think that's the actual spell name, but it is along the lines. Hold on. Oh, it's Of Dragon's Majesty.

That was a misspeak on my part. Do you think your grandmother would have defeated a really cool dragon and perhaps made a potion out of them?

[Speaker 3]
My grandmother befriended a really cool, powerful dragon and saved his life.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you don't have... Yeah. Well, you wouldn't...

That wasn't in the character, but you just need a scale from it to create a potion from it, so maybe they have a potion or two of it? Maybe, but what does it do? I can take a...

Let me just copy-paste the text. If you want to become a dragon.

[Speaker 5]
Interesting. Interesting. Potion of Become Dragon.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, it's serpent-like. Yeah, it's close enough.

[Speaker 2]
Or maybe dragon vessel, if they're close enough. I don't think they're close enough. Oh, plump.

Oh, well.

[Speaker 3]
They're all the way back in Stampede. Um...

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Let's see. So, things you can probably ask for.

They said weapons, potions, and what was the other one?

[Speaker 1]
Weapons, potions, and information.

[Speaker 3]
Information.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's just equipment in general. Like, those would be scrolls. He had scrolls, he got potions that they mentioned specifically.

[Speaker 3]
How they defeated... Okay.

[Speaker 4]
He got scrolls and potions.

[Speaker 6]
Ask for an AK-47.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's right. No, I did actually ask for a gun. He was like, just reach into this crevice or whatever, and ask for anything.

And, you know, I'm a red-blooded American, so gun.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, they do exist, albeit not very strongly.

[Speaker 3]
Monk has two.

[Speaker 2]
He needs to find the second one that got stolen, but he has them. Stolen? He stole it?

How did he manage that?

[Speaker 3]
Because I rolled on the table. On the stupid downtime table. Oh.

I'm sorry. Fine. It's fun.

I guess information is a good one.

[Speaker 1]
I just like drawing a little journal or something.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay. I should be thinking of information about the spider.

How it vanquished last time.

[Speaker 1]
You get a little journal book. It's mostly empty when you first look at it, but similar to how the tablet came up, there was a when you open it, it says, Write in Me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Your name should probably go first.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. She goes into her bag and she's like, where's my pen?

[Speaker 2]
Would you like to borrow mine? Oh, yes, please. She's got a lot of shit in her bag of holding.

And he just hands it over. He hands over the pen that he... It's his scroll writing pen, so do take care of it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, of course, of course. She'll write This is Mimosa into Grandmother's name I have that number in my bag. What does that do?

[Speaker 1]
It says, Hello, Mimosa. How can I help you?

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god, it's an AI.

[Speaker 1]
P.S. Did you remember to pack lunch?

[Speaker 3]
Always! Exclamation point. Oh, jeez.

What can you tell me about this spider?

[Speaker 1]
When we defeated it last, it was holed up in an onyx pyramid. It had taken the form of one of the It's spirit had been sucked into one of the elder mummies of the world. It had been buried for basically a couple thousand years.

One of the Yuan-T, the snake folk. When we When we attacked the My duck's in a row here. When we attacked the mummy, he had set up a backup, basically to accept his own soul if the one of the spider had been killed.

So he could take the spider's power, but if the thought, then he wouldn't be forced to basically, he wouldn't be able to he wouldn't be forced to die himself. At least that's what he thought. We developed the dagger that you have now, and we had two of them.

These were later fused, but we had two of them at the time, and instead of attacking him directly, we used the magic of the daggers to team up on his attendants and his guests of honor. He had held a feast at which we were supposed to be killed and we were cordially invited to be executed and made an example of. Instead of doing this, we simply attacked his guests and the magic of the daggers carried the harm and wounds of his guests over to him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wow.

[Speaker 1]
The mummy's plan did work. His soul, in a fashion at least, his soul did make it back to a rather horrid creature that should never have been made undead, but somehow was, called a shivergroth.

[Speaker 7]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We attempted to bend it because it bore the mark of the spider and we feared that we could feel it kind of draining on us a bit in the process but unfortunately your sister was... Unfortunately my sister was killed in the fight. That's why I brought her back to the cave, which I hope you're in right now.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Exclamation mark. What?

Oh, sorry. It's just because... Never mind.

Okay. I do ignore that.

[Speaker 3]
What potions did you find useful in fighting?

[Speaker 1]
Potions of speed are always effective. Potions of speed and potions of greater invisibility were our greatest allies.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Bless you. Thanks.

The cosmos will be like, oh Grigio says hi. Do you guys have any spells for speed and greater invisibility?

[Speaker 2]
I have greater invisibility. I have a boon of speed. And let's see, do I have haste?

I do not have haste. Yeah, so just greater invisibility. Alas, enhanceability does not speed.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Can I keep the book?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 2]
I do wonder, since they're snake-based, would they have Serpent Scale Mail?

[Speaker 3]
Do you have Serpent Scale Mail?

[Speaker 7]
Yes, we each had one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. And the Robe of Serpents?

[Speaker 1]
Is it robe? I think you said Serpent Scale Mail.

[Speaker 2]
I did say both, yes. I was asking about both.

[Speaker 3]
And then you said, is it Serpent Robes? Robe of Serpents, but... What about Robe of Serpents?

We only get one.

[Speaker 1]
Robe of Serpents? Yes, we also had those.

[Speaker 7]
That's sweet. Well, that's convenient.

[Speaker 3]
Be able to pull the armor out.

[Speaker 4]
You said something about an onyx pyramid. Didn't we pick something like that up on the way here?

[Speaker 3]
The thing that matched your sword, I think?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I was playing with it. Oh, does it not attach to your your weapon? I think it just kind of has a magnetism towards it, but it doesn't attach to it.

I did say something about an onyx pyramid.

[Speaker 1]
The only onyx pyramid that you guys have come across before is where you got that sword. Hm.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Do you want me to ask about the sterob and more?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that might be a good idea, actually.

[Speaker 3]
I say we found a sterob and a headpiece, and I'll describe them. Are they yours? Do you know them?

[Speaker 1]
It sounds like those of the spider zombies are the mummy who claimed him. They certainly weren't ours, though we were never averse to picking up trinkets and souvenirs. If you noticed any tarnish on them, that would be ours.

Just a quick question.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, this was just repeating information to make sure I heard correctly. We found a pommel for a sword that was onyx-colored?

[Speaker 1]
No, it was like a scale. It was triangular in nature. Some of these guys have gone into an onyx pyramid, and it's composed of these overlapping scales.

They're very geometrical, but otherwise laid out like a snake's.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Or a fish, or a dragon, or anything else with scales.

[Speaker 2]
And the thing that was found that was doing the magnetic effect thing was being messed with?

[Speaker 1]
That was the scale.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to add the dagger to your...

[Speaker 3]
I edited this for a reason.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Mimosa, you're just in your character sheet now.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie, thank you. Does the thing he found match the little gem holder?

[Speaker 1]
Again, when I say it's a scale, it's like a plate size. Like a big plate.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 4]
About what time do you think we'll be wrapping this up? I'm getting sleepy.

[Speaker 1]
I'm down for one more bout of shenanigans if you guys are. Okay. I do want you guys to fight that fucking thing.

I think it'd be awesome.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I guess I'll ask for some armor. That'll be my third thing.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. There's some stuff here. Were you looking for...

So the serpent scale mail is... ... Oh, so it's just scale mail but it lets you apply your full dexterity modifier.

What is the armor class of scale mail? Yeah, that's... 14 or 15, I think.

Yeah, it's 14, so... It would allow Mimosa to apply her full modifier, which is 5, so that would raise her armor class to 19.

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't... There's no stealth disadvantage on it.

[Speaker 6]
Exactly. Do you need proficiency?

[Speaker 3]
What?

[Speaker 6]
Well, it is scale mail.

[Speaker 3]
I'm looking it up right now. I don't remember off the top of my head.

[Speaker 1]
Do you only have proficiency in light armor?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay. Well, then maybe the robe of serpents?

[Speaker 1]
If you draw the armor, it probably just returns something different.

[Speaker 3]
What does the... serpent robe do?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'll just paste the text in. Giant snake, basically.

[Speaker 4]
I'll be right back. No worries.

[Speaker 3]
Ew.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I could just have them do a light armor version of this that just has an armor class.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Why am I overcomplicating something? They already said that they had this.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you agree?

[Speaker 6]
It could just be a version of the armor that you're proficient with it while you're wearing it. Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 2]
Just ignores proficiency. I've seen...

[Speaker 1]
Hell, it's the purpose of magic.

[Speaker 3]
Sorry if you're feeling all over the place. Yeah, she belched right next to me.

[Speaker 7]
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Yeah, I'll take the light armor.

[Speaker 5]
Augie got locked in the bathroom somehow.

[Speaker 3]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 5]
And he was meowing, and I was trying to figure out where heck he was.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's not really his usual thing. Where are you trying to go? You can't go there.

[Speaker 5]
How many items do you have left to grab?

[Speaker 3]
Just the armor. Okay. I have the dagger, the journal.

Will the journal work outside the cave? Can I just talk to them? Yeah, sure.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That's two enchanted books I own. What's the first one? Um, a book that lets me capture fate.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Oh. Have you successfully captured a fairy with this?

Excuse me, a book that can what?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 2]
Never use it on her.

[Speaker 4]
I'm aware of that, but...

[Speaker 1]
Wasn't Kibi there? Didn't Kibi get captured by it?

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, I don't know what we're talking about. No, Kibi did not get captured by that.

[Speaker 1]
Her fairy did.

[Speaker 4]
What did Charis get captured by? What are we talking about?

[Speaker 3]
Remember the dungeon crawl we did where we chose not to fight? We used our wits to get out of stuff?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, vaguely.

[Speaker 3]
That was where I got the book. You got caught in a book? Oh.

Huh.

[Speaker 5]
And then I didn't know about it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I tore the page out. Oh man, is that still usable?

Oh yeah, I've got so many uses on it. Oh my god, okay. It was like a 50 page book.

[Speaker 6]
Mercer's big book of fae.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I have, I think, two from that dungeon crawl still in there. I wrote it down so I can look.

Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Charis might need help with this.

[Speaker 3]
Well, if you were asleep, this wouldn't be happening. She did the, I have gas and now I'm awake, so.

[Speaker 6]
I am. Alright. I ordered food.

It's nearly here so I might need to dip for a moment, in a moment.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Well, Mercer is ready to leave when she gets her armor.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so you've gotten the dagger, the book, the armor. You have one more, no? No, I only have three.

I mean, there are four pillars.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's four.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there's four!

[Speaker 3]
Oh my gosh! Okay. My bad.

Well, shit.

[Speaker 6]
I'll be back soon.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I don't know what to ask for. I guess should I just ask for a potion of invisibility?

[Speaker 2]
Greater invisibility. Greater invisibility, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll just ask for that. Unless anybody has any other ideas.

[Speaker 2]
I'll try to think of some, but at the moment, no. Besides, I guess getting the extra snake friends. No, not really.

Yeah, I'll just get the potion.

[Speaker 3]
That way, in case someone else needs it, besides the shell slot.

[Speaker 1]
All right, your armor class has been adjusted and fixed up.

[Speaker 3]
Woo!

[Speaker 2]
Congratulations.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, look at that. That's so beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
All right. So, the I think I'm just going to upload this map here, and then let's have a fight with this fucker. What we'll probably do is we'll take a short break so that Jack can get back, and then just everybody will jump right into the fight.

Okay. You guys will sneak into the tower.

[Speaker 3]
Gentle. There you go. I think she instinctively knew that I was going to have this session, and she likes to watch.

[Speaker 1]
Now I just gotta wait on this thing to upload.

[Speaker 6]
Sounds like I'm back just in time.

[Speaker 1]
All right, perfect. Still waiting. Yes!

It changes. I'm going to copy your character tokens over from this map so that we can get your current states.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. I'll place down the owl myself when we get there. I'm dead.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. Where's Ron? Oh, there we go.

Hiding from me. Now those of you with passive abilities versus undead, please remind me of them.

[Speaker 6]
Do you want me to remind you every time it's relevant? My halo is disadvantaged on attacks against me within the radius I have. I will remind you of that whenever it's relevant.

[Speaker 2]
Against undead? I don't have any at the moment being only at level 8. Only for my spellcasting and killing people with spells.

Otherwise, no.

[Speaker 5]
That's a fascinating nomination. Sunbeam gives undead and oozes disadvantage on the saving throw. I like oozes.

Oozes are kind of confusing on that one.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe they start to boil? Oh, possibly.

[Speaker 1]
I totally believe that.

[Speaker 5]
Boiling ooze.

[Speaker 2]
Casual soup.

[Speaker 1]
Close out of all these tabs so I'm not getting my ram is not getting destroyed.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, fish.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful map. It is mostly not mine. Which saved me a lot of time.

Best type of map. One you don't have to make. Okay, so y'all will have snuck around the mummy camp, which is currently looking for you.

The more you look, the more you see the sign of the spire on these various troops. You're able to sneak past and go through a little, basically it's like a manhole, pretty much. Adjacent to the tower that lets you enter from not the front entrance.

Exactly. And when you pop out of the hole, you are in this lovely little pool of water.

[Speaker 4]
Fish.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can be right next to the fish.

[Speaker 2]
What joy.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Alright, there is a thundering sound of footsteps here. Y'all are going to have about a minute to prepare, however you wish.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. Let me just...

[Speaker 6]
Either a religion or arcana check to recall knowledge about mummies. Mainly things to look out for. I will do my arcana.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to hide. I'm gonna... Oh, that's actually a good idea.

I will also do that.

[Speaker 7]
I want that sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
One... Two... There will be quite a few zombies, apologies for this.

Three... And then skeletons. One...

Two... Three... Four.

Alrighty. That would be all my undead that have been trapezing behind us.

[Speaker 7]
Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
I guess in case of emergency I can... Should I bag of tricks now?

[Speaker 1]
To answer your question, Landy, I have a better idea of who's going where. Yeah. There we go.

For mummies, usually it's going to be a... The best way to take care of it is going to be with fire. Creatures who've undergone mummification usually have some kind of...

Usually share the sort of pretty devastating... I guess I'm going to replace it. Usually share the kind of devastating curses that mummy lords bring to bear if they are of a sufficiently magical nature unto themselves.

What they do, the process of mummification does result in them retaining that kind of fire vulnerability. And then, let's see here. Last chance for...

Who's hiding?

[Speaker 2]
I am. I can do a sneak attack.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Just so that I won't get gomped.

[Speaker 4]
And then Rana, who are you death warding?

[Speaker 5]
Myself.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll death ward Kibi.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, my brain is lagging because I'm tired. So I'm just going to be hitting things.

[Speaker 6]
Ideally, we want Kibi and Rana to be in the front line. The rest can be sneaky.

[Speaker 2]
I'll be hiding and I'm using one of the zombies as a meat shield. I'm going to also cast Guardian of Faith. I can use them as a distraction.

[Speaker 5]
It's fine. Do we know what direction it's coming from?

[Speaker 1]
It's coming from the direction of the pyramid.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll have her right there then. Where's the...

[Speaker 2]
This direction?

[Speaker 1]
The pyramid. So that's on the southeast corner of the map there.

[Speaker 2]
Then I should... Let's see. I could probably also cast them in that direction before it pops up.

Just before it pops up. Black tentacles. Are all these skeletons yours?

Yes, yes they are. Let me... The benefits of being a necromancer.

[Speaker 4]
I was definitely going to start fighting them.

[Speaker 1]
Are the enemies coming from the bottom left, James? Bottom right. That's where the pyramid is.

Can you guys see that thing?

[Speaker 4]
I think. This bright thing? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I meant to say bottom right. I'm just an idiot.

[Speaker 2]
Just a quick question. Who would want advantage so that my birds can just be there?

[Speaker 4]
I can do an extra d12 of damage if I have advantage on my attacks. But if anybody else has a...

[Speaker 6]
Mimosa and Kiwi are the best. Thanks for that.

[Speaker 1]
Does anybody have anything else to give them advantage?

[Speaker 2]
Oh wait, I guess my my gratuitous amount of creatures can also help you guys.

[Speaker 6]
I think Mimosa is the best choice because Kiwi can reckless attack.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay. Then...

Where are you? I'm hiding. Half a zombie is a meat shield.

Nice. So you can get half cover from that. I'm just a halfling.

[Speaker 5]
We'll cover. Do halflings get extra cover from being smaller or am I thinking Pathfinder again?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
I think she might be thinking.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so Kiwi, you can have... I can throw daggers under his legs.

[Speaker 2]
Really? So Kiwi, you can have owl help. Mimosa, you can have zombie meat shield help.

And these guys will just be chilling. For now. What exactly does besides being a meat shield does it mechanically do?

Well... Zombies are best for being meat shields of all things, but they do do some amount of damage. Okay.

Mostly meat shields, I'm gonna be real with you. The skeletons are for just some amount of attack and generally just drawing fire away. So they can be over there.

Yes. I'll hide away an extra zombie because I'll probably need that.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, it's the lightfoot halfling that I'm thinking of. Everybody got their shit together?

[Speaker 4]
Do I ever?

[Speaker 1]
Give me just a second because this doesn't look big enough. You have to make it even more massive.

[Speaker 7]
That's what she said. That's what she said, my god.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we're done for the night.

[Speaker 2]
We're ending here.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, but it's one creature so perhaps bag of tricks now. Inventory. Bag of tricks.

Scroll.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, adding a combat encounter. Go ahead, folks.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
What dog? The main thing is to not let a mummy put you to zero hit points if they hit you physically. It will just kill you straight up.

[Speaker 2]
That is not good.

[Speaker 4]
If Kibi dies, please bring her back.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi has death ward so you can at least have one of that happen.

[Speaker 1]
Climbing over the ridge here. What the fuck? Is a creature with crab-like or spider-like depending on your definition of your limbs.

Eight of them with a central body that looks like a daddy long legs central body in a way that's compact and seemingly attached to the limbs at random except the entire thing is composed of mouths that stretch out at ridiculous distances that the body clearly can't accommodate.

[Speaker 4]
Is it too late to leave?

[Speaker 1]
The entire thing is swapped to bandages.

[Speaker 3]
Does Kibi go poofy? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Soils the water. The fish swim away. No!

[Speaker 1]
The fish are like jumping out of the water at the moment.

[Speaker 4]
They're trying to flee by any means.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have much of a choice in it. This thing is the biggest creature you have ever seen in your entire life.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi wants to kill it but also terrified. Those are the best hunts though.

[Speaker 1]
The symbol for rolling initiative is so fucking tiny compared to... I can't even see it. Okay, Mimosa you are up first.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If anybody would like to lower their initiative or anything like that or change it, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm thinking of holding my action holding my turn. I don't know what's in like 30 feet.

[Speaker 1]
There comes something 30 feet. Okay, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
That way I can throw my dagger at it. Sneak attack.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, alright.

[Speaker 6]
If it's my turn, it's just in range of Guiding Bolt I will launch a 5th level Guiding Bolt at it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
We'll then upcast it to 6th level.

[Speaker 1]
Is that within range?

[Speaker 6]
Just. 120 feet. I've got 5 feet left.

Okay. Watch this miss. Is that a crit?

Oh my lord.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah. Watch this miss. Crits.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty fortuitous diving.

[Speaker 6]
So that's 9d6 times 18d6 I need to add an extra 10d6. Oh. Oh no.

Very good. Piranha pulls one of her bells out and circles it around her head and it just launches a searing white light at this guy. Okay.

That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Activate my shield. That's probably a good idea. It's not happy right now.

It is going to move over here and it's going to dash. Classic. Enjoy.

[Speaker 2]
That is a massive thing. Imagine that running at you.

[Speaker 6]
Don't have to imagine. I'm doing it right now.

[Speaker 2]
That is true.

[Speaker 6]
That is true.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I meant more like in real life. That would be.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
What is 25 feet across?

[Speaker 3]
Screaming.

[Speaker 5]
Wow. No.

[Speaker 3]
It is within throwing range. That's cool.

[Speaker 1]
My two hits.

[Speaker 3]
My unimportant dagger addicts don't want to lose my good ones. Awesome. Very good.

I can still throw my other dagger at it.

[Speaker 1]
You do have the extra attack basically while you have the extra attack feature while you're tuned to the other dagger. You just keep doing your thing.

[Speaker 3]
Does it take an extra or does it take an ability to action to do an extra attack?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, because you have the extra attack feature now. But sorry to be that guy. That was a reaction which you can't use extra attack on.

Oh, because, yeah. Okay, that's fine. Because holding your action uses your basically also uses up your reaction.

[Speaker 6]
Don't worry, I know every 5e roll that can screw us over.

[Speaker 3]
No, that's fine. That's perfect. Well, good.

That makes it easy for me then I'm done. I get to just wince and hope it doesn't charge me.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Kibi.

[Speaker 4]
Does that mean I don't have a reaction for this round?

[Speaker 1]
No, it does. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
So is this me fighting both of these things? What is this thing?

[Speaker 5]
That's my guardian of faith.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, alright, cool. Kibi's going to... We just got the freaky spike.

Uh, I'm gonna run up to it. Is it a bad idea? Maybe.

Is it my only option? Yeah. Um, so...

[Speaker 7]
Being a barbarian.

[Speaker 4]
What do you think about this? What is it? Um, and I have advantage, right?

With the bird? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The good news is this thing will hit you regardless of whether or not you're using sneak or reckless attack.

[Speaker 4]
25? Does 25 hit? 25 hits.

Ooh! Oh! 11 plus 12.

If I could do math, I'd be impressed. Okay. Um, one more attack.

Yeah, that hits.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Here's going to use a legendary reaction to you coming within space here. Make four bite attacks against you.

Alright, so against one of those attacks, if you want, you could use your reaction to attempt to fight... attempt to fend off the bite by basically attacking it. And if you succeed, you'll chop off one of the heads.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... What do I do?

[Speaker 1]
So you make an attack, basically an attack of opportunity against this thing.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah, I'll do that.

[Speaker 1]
And if you deal more than 10 damage, it definitely hits.

[Speaker 4]
No!

[Speaker 1]
Why don't you roll with advantage?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I could still do that. Hold on.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Do I roll the attack?

[Speaker 1]
Um, sure, roll it. You get the crit fish. If Baldur's Gate 3 lets me reroll the attack for Reckless, then, uh...

It lets me choose Reckless after I roll the attack.

[Speaker 4]
Uh...

[Speaker 1]
I can't! You added D12!

[Speaker 4]
I added D12? My brain's not working. Okay, right.

There we go. It's definitely more than 10.

[Speaker 1]
5 damage. 5 damage. It takes an additional 10 damage for losing one of these heads.

Which is good, because now one of the heads is going to be afraid to attack you in the future, so next time it does this kind of multi-attack against you, it'll only deal with the three heads. Bad news is... Alright.

DB is... Bramble, and takes a grand total of... 7...

He is 43 damage.

[Speaker 4]
43 damage. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I should just exploit his health for everybody.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on. I didn't hit rage before, but I have been acting as if I was raging, so I'm just going to go ahead and click it. Usability.

Okay. Also, you said 43 damage?

[Speaker 1]
Total of 43 damage.

[Speaker 4]
Jesus. 43 damage. Uh...

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
B. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
50. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, would the resistance to piercing apply here, too? What is resistance in 5E?

[Speaker 1]
Resistance is half. Rounded down. Yes.

So, if Kibi was raging, then she would have only taken 21 damage. Does that make sense?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. So I add...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you're raging. Yeah, she's been raging. Okay.

Brings us to Para.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on. Can you say that number again? What was it?

20?

[Speaker 1]
21.

[Speaker 5]
If you don't want to do a lot of math, when you right-click on your character, you see the number that comes up at the bottom?

[Speaker 4]
Right-click on my character.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
If you click on that number, and then you just hit the subtract button, and then the number you're trying to subtract by, it will automatically do math for you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Nice. Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Anything that keeps me from having to do math... Um... Yeah, I just Google it.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I just Google what's 5 minus 8. I can't turn it off.

[Speaker 6]
Going one step further, if you have your character token selected, you can right-click on the damage in chat, and you can apply half damage from there.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I did know that.

[Speaker 1]
You can also do it as healing. Oh, that's right. Yeah, it is Para's turn, and then Dr. Bacia afterwards.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Um, spell question. If I am casting a bonus action leveled spell, I can cast it...

Yeah. Do I have to do them in any specific order?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
What was the bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
Fair enough. Is it a challenge?

[Speaker 1]
It is a promise. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, James Jeremy Crawford.

[Speaker 1]
I will be killing his family as well.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna do this at this level. Uh, what is it? Alright, bonus action spiritual weapon.

Um, do I have a spiritual weapon pre-made? I don't. I'll just use this as a stand-in.

I thought you did. I thought I did too, and I'm wondering if maybe I put it in something else. Um...

Yeah, 60 feet? That's 60 feet.

[Speaker 1]
I see called spirit from Rana, but not spiritual weapon.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know if it's called genic spirit.

[Speaker 5]
Is this the same thing? It is not. I will...

Oh, it can make an attack. Okay. I wish it gave me the buttons for attacking on that.

[Speaker 1]
Why does it not give you the buttons for attacking on here? Uh, I'm just gonna do a d20. That's gonna hit with your spell bonus.

I guarantee it.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, uh, and then that is 7th level, so that is 1... So, 7d8 if I'm doing my math correctly. So, 7d8 plus my spellcasting ability modifier.

Um, and then the other spell I'm gonna cast is, uh... Sacred Flame. Yeah?

Sacred Flame? Yeah, that's also 60 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Yes. That's true.

Sacred Flame. Okay. Alright, and what was your damage for the, um...

[Speaker 5]
Um, I'm trying to figure that out.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Plus my spellcasting ability, so it's plus... Okay.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
There. Okay. Okay.

That is a legendary reaction to taking this damage. It's going to use Legendary Song. All of you may be a dc23 wisdom saver today.

Yes! I love that one.

[Speaker 6]
It's really the best saving Ah, nuggets.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Um, and then I have the ability to make mine higher, so I'm going to...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so it's a wisdom saver.

[Speaker 5]
Lucky you. Wisdom saver, no. I wrote wisdom...

I'm sorry, I'm smart.

[Speaker 4]
Oh dear. Wisdom... I don't know why I was thinking that.

What? Damn it! I don't think Katie can make that.

Oh, can I not? Okay. Well.

[Speaker 6]
I have a plus one. Not looking good.

[Speaker 4]
This sucks.

[Speaker 6]
You said dc23?

[Speaker 1]
Those of you who succeeded take 20 psychic damage. Those of you who failed... I rolled a 20.

Ha! Well, no, it's those of you who succeeded take 20 psychic damage.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I succeeded.

[Speaker 1]
I took 20. Oh, okay, okay. Those of you who...

Okay, I got confusion. Those of you who failed are under the effects of the confusion spell.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, sorry, I rolled a 20 to apply damage, not for my save.

[Speaker 1]
I... Oh, okay. So I didn't have to do anything.

I totally... I'm with you. Oh, there we go.

I can just apply this to show players. There you go. Beautiful.

[Speaker 2]
That's delightful.

[Speaker 1]
So, something like this, for instance, is what you roll. Um... The people who failed take damage.

People who failed do not take damage. Only the people who succeeded.

[Speaker 2]
So it's confusion or damage. That's nice. I think I prefer damage.

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm happy with it still. No one's getting away. There's no save or suck here.

Nobody's getting away with it this time. You guys are fucked. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Please ignore the fact that it said a skeleton rolled that. That was for me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, alright. I'm pretty sure only the skeleton gets to do the next one.

[Speaker 2]
Does that... Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Do I have to roll for every single one of my creatures?

[Speaker 1]
No, the skeletons are for sure psychic damage.

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm saying that roll was for me. I don't...

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm kidding. I don't think that the skeleton is affected by the confusion spell.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, as well.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so go ahead and take your turn.

[Speaker 2]
How long does the confusion spell last for? One minute. Oh, boy.

Anyway, I'll just...

[Speaker 1]
Let me... You repeat the save at the beginning of each of your turns but take your fucking turn first because you can do that normally. Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. I'm just... These are for the skeleton bow attacks, so just four of them.

Two, three... There we go. So, how many hit...

I can just roll for damage, right? So, that's fine. It'll just glance off.

That's okay. It can distract them for now. So, no need for damage because it's, well, immune.

In the meantime, I'm going to make its life a bit more difficult so that next time someone gets something, it's... Yeah. Ah, that's better.

Okay, so seven psychic damage and it removes two from its next saving throw. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
What happens if I succeed?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you just made it! Well, then you'd... Let's see.

Then you just succeed. Since it's a cantrip, there is no...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Half damage.

[Speaker 1]
If you want, this thing is vulnerable to fire damage. You could have your zombies... Good to know.

Good to know. ...

[Speaker 2]
Well, um... Note this off next time. Just make them light torches and run to it.

Right there. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Mimosa and then Rana's on deck.

[Speaker 4]
I like seeing the death bar at the bottom of them. Err!

[Speaker 6]
I felt it was appropriate for this one.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
There's a soul-style boss bar module that I love using.

[Speaker 3]
When do I... roll to try to...

[Speaker 1]
At the beginning of each of your turns.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's for the confusion table.

[Speaker 1]
The... Do I roll to get out? Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Alright. Alright.

Well, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, whoops. Uh, Rana.

[Speaker 6]
I... will... I'll cast Guiding Bolt again at 4th level this time.

[Speaker 1]
That hits.

[Speaker 6]
31 radiant damage. The next attack has advantage.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 6]
That is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Good job.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, hey. Oh, no, that's leaving space. Never mind.

[Speaker 1]
It did leave... Wait, no, because Kibi's... Kibi's grappled by it, so Kibi's just continuing on.

Alright, Kibi, you're going to take three bite attacks because you got off one of its heads last time. And then Rana will take four, and the Owl will take four.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, tragic. The Owl's technically not highlighted. Oh!

You're right.

[Speaker 6]
We love to see it.

[Speaker 5]
What the... There's a skeleton, like, way in the back that is highlighted, though.

[Speaker 1]
How could I possibly resist? Of course, why not? Kibi, would you like to use your reaction to, um...

Oh, wait, you don't have your reaction back yet.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. That sucks. Kibi, quick question, what's your AC?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, it's probably not what it should be, but it's 16.

[Speaker 5]
As a Barbarian?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
No, that's mine.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's a grand total of... ... 28 plus 17 is 45 damage.

So, let's go put slash bar 45, and then you could right-click that, and, uh, have it.

[Speaker 6]
Well, because there's an odd number with the 17, that would get halved, too. Let it get rounded down. It'd be slightly different.

Oh, no, the 45 would as well. We're good, we're good. Oh, okay.

If they were all odd numbers, you would have cheesed it.

[Speaker 1]
Great, listen, um, stranger things have happened. Alright, time to attack Ronald.

[Speaker 6]
Your AC is 22.

[Speaker 1]
Do I have any... So, the creature is not...

[Speaker 6]
It's not in my halo radius, so it's fine. Unless it has to enter. Oh.

I assume this is just a cone attack, right? It's, uh, sort of, yes. Does it enter melee range to hit me?

[Speaker 1]
Um, it has no...

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it heads into.

[Speaker 1]
No, then it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Well, 45 applies to all creatures in that cone, right? Nope.

[Speaker 6]
That's three misses. I cannot believe I fucking missed. She rolled...

The highest she rolled is a five. What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
If you rolled a six, she would have hit. Well, it didn't hit. You can attempt to fend it off.

[Speaker 6]
Um, how does that work?

[Speaker 1]
Basically, you make an attack of opportunity against it.

[Speaker 6]
Let me bring out the cult tunic dagger, then.

[Speaker 3]
It's fucking nice. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I get 14 spirits! I think it's the only way you could have, um, actually forced it to lose a head. So, it takes 14 damage from that.

It takes an additional 10 damage from losing a head. And now the number of attacks it can make against you is increased by one. Normally, every time it does a bite attack against a creature, it makes four of them.

But if you cut off those specific heads, they kind of like retreat and recoil in fear. They don't want to attack you anymore. And, um, you know what?

I think I'm just gonna drag... I'm just gonna drag Kibi along. We're on a funny little joyride to where these squishy spellcasters are.

[Speaker 3]
An opportunity attack!

[Speaker 1]
You do have an opportunity attack.

[Speaker 3]
I do get an opportunity. Yeah, I don't know if I can. Am I in confusion?

[Speaker 1]
It's not your turn, so you still get reactions.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah! I'm just along for the ride. I go now...

[Speaker 1]
It's a fucking ghost.

[Speaker 6]
Goddamn. I get 14 spirits, baby!

[Speaker 3]
The 24 hit.

[Speaker 1]
It hits?

[Speaker 5]
I don't have to move.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. Where is your sneak attack? Give me your sneak attack.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I do?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you got that zombie next to you. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Speaker 5]
You should also probably re-roll that, then, and see if you get a crit.

[Speaker 3]
Well, okay. Listen, apparently my luck tonight is the same or lower, so... I'll take it.

Nice!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah! Which one's the fire? The 10 damage is the fire, so it'll take an extra...

It's a little 50 damage to it. It's vulnerable to fire.

[Speaker 4]
Almost less than half? Less than half left. So I just needed to just keep moving by me, guys.

[Speaker 1]
Another maddening song. Okay, those of you who are... Let's see, I'm just going to put this in the chat.

I don't know how much better reactions for these fucking guys. Okay, so those of you who are currently confused, you are no longer confused. But those of you who succeeded prior, you have to make another save.

[Speaker 3]
You guys got this. I believe in you.

[Speaker 5]
Good work.

[Speaker 1]
Are you able to see your token?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, actually, you always will see your own token on top of things. At least I thought. But my spirit guardian is not, for some reason.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys want to avoid that, just add a 1 to your token. Rana takes another... Rana and Paraboh take another 20 psychic damage.

Dr. Basha, Peevee, Mimosa... Is that... Is that crazy?

What? What's up? I thought we had 6 people here die.

I might see.

[Speaker 3]
It must be insane.

[Speaker 1]
Those of you who were confused are no longer confused.

[Speaker 3]
Except for you.

[Speaker 5]
And they're immune for the next 24 hours.

[Speaker 1]
Or until incapacitated by the Shivergirls.

[Speaker 3]
There's this big old circle. I was going to Bacon of Hope. Oh, that's your Bacon of Hope, okay.

[Speaker 1]
But now I don't know if we need it.

[Speaker 4]
How do I ungrapple myself? Or can I just chop off a head?

[Speaker 1]
You could just attack the head.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll do that. Did it hit?

[Speaker 1]
15 does hit.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. I'm also just going to roll again. 19 hits, okay.

11 and 12. 12. I think that's all I can do.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's...

[Speaker 3]
Hey wait, when it moved, did it go past the Guardian?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Everybody along that line got attacked by the Guardian.

[Speaker 1]
And I think I take half.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, half on a successful.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Alright, Kibi is no longer grappled. Does Kibi have anything else that she would like to...

Oh, goddammit.

[Speaker 4]
No, I'm not going to run away because that would be counterproductive. Yeah, I'll just stay here in the danger zone.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is fine. Jesus Christ. Alright, it's going to use Maddening Song again.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I think Ron and I are the only ones who are still taking this.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think you and Ron are the only ones who are still getting damaged by it. Alright. 20 psychic damage.

[Speaker 5]
And then... Okay, do I get a... Kibi's taking damage.

Rana's taking damage. Rana, are you in my limit? No, you're 10 away.

If I move here, it can't opportunity me, right?

[Speaker 1]
Right, because you're still within range. Okay, I'll move here. Actually, that's bad.

If you do move within it, it has another legendary reaction for that. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I will stay. And I will simply... I will simply do a regular Cure Wound upon myself.

[Speaker 7]
What are you doing?

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. This is too dark patient.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'm going to... I'm just going to... I'm a little out of the way.

Is it possible to do it on the edge here? Where it only hits... Um...

[Speaker 1]
Fireball? Yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, these are magical flames. That's fine. Yeah.

I cannot move the thing. Please imagine that circle's just a bit closer and it's only hitting the thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like that.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'll just have to make a save. Oh wait, no I can't. Go!

Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

[Speaker 4]
At least... At least... Lady Luck is on our side today.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it's 56 and that means double.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet. 62 damage. Hello.

In the meantime, these... Yeah, no, that's about it. If I...

Hold on. You said by getting them to light torches. How would I exactly set them on fire just by bringing them up to it?

[Speaker 1]
You would just say that they had... If they had the torches, they'd probably have the stuff to light the torches. Then you'd just order them to do that.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm just imagining zombies. Okay, well this one has enough room to get closer so that one's going to light the torch and go on its attacking spree. These ones are not close enough yet, but I'll just move them so that, you know, eventually they'll get there.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, nuggets.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Within 20 feet. Yeah, no, these guys are fine.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, right.

[Speaker 2]
Hold on as I just... Right, I'm still on measuring mode. Yeah, we can go over here to avoid...

[Speaker 4]
Oh god, okay, we're going to take the higher one, because advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Definitely not the crit one. You said it looks derotating? Nuggets.

Alright, well.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so KB false prone.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I can't make it. If it's a 23, I can't make it. I only have a plus 2.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Alright, so you could apply that damage. Mimosa also failed.

[Speaker 4]
Apply 20 damage?

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa can use evasion to halve the damage, but she's still going to fall.

[Speaker 4]
That's what I was looking for. Yeah, we can try.

[Speaker 1]
What I'll do...

[Speaker 4]
Did you say apply 20 damage?

[Speaker 1]
It's 20 bludgeoning damage, so apply that, however.

[Speaker 7]
It'll be popped because you're raging.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So it's only 10 in that case. Oh, well, hold on. This guy is...

This guy is dead. By nature of being a thing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then top of the round is Mimosa. You are prone.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, how much damage did this one, this skeleton, do by lighting a torch and going up to it?

[Speaker 1]
Have him roll... Do you roll and attack it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. Hold on.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm going to apply the damage to your character. Ah, missed.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, I already applied the damage to the character. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It said that you were still at 74 hit points.

[Speaker 2]
Really? Huh. On my notes it says it's at 54.

[Speaker 1]
There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Rip that skeleton buff.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so top of the round is Mimosa.

[Speaker 3]
Getting up prone, how long does that take?

[Speaker 1]
Half movement.

[Speaker 3]
Half movement, okay. I'm going to get up, and I'm...

[Speaker 1]
I thought you threw up my movement, but... This thing is not helping great.

[Speaker 3]
It said go 5 feet.

[Speaker 1]
He's got a lot of legendary reactions, which is good for you. Yep, you have plenty of balance around. That hits.

How do you want to do this?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm so happy that was Mimosa. Very fitting. She goes for the underbelly.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Y'all watch as Mimosa gets flung by the stomp, like literally gets kicked about 10 feet into the air. Not hit by the leg, but just by the movement of earth.

Setting her like a lever. A tiny put shot for the halflings. But Mimosa turns it into a win.

She snags onto one of the legs with one of her daggers, ties a rope over, swings forward to the underbelly so that she can actually reach it. This thing is like 40 feet in the air. And y'all just watch as she stamps the blade in, and a crest of fire just erupts and burns halfway through this thing, like just completely bisects it, and the rope swings her back down to relative safety as the rest of this thing burns out.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. It's dead.

[Speaker 3]
Is everybody okay?

[Speaker 2]
Relatively.

[Speaker 3]
Yep, mostly. Oh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Is there anything that can be garnered from the creature?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, like a trophy, or something useful for the others.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, a number of the heads have been cut off.

[Speaker 4]
That's right. Let's take one of the heads and stuff it.

[Speaker 1]
And there is an obsidian scarab. It's visible within the center of this thing.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh. Ooh. There's also that pyramid.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, we can explore the pyramid. Perhaps though, we should though.

[Speaker 3]
Take a nap? This was the guardian. The little attack dog.

[Speaker 1]
Mmhmm. We're also going to receive the dagger. It just kind of appears in your left hand.

You receive the dagger of the spider. Ah!

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, thanks. I will claim that.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you everybody for helping me save.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Ooh, small update to my schedule. I will be mostly free from the 6th to the 9th because we're going to have to edit our move update.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
A bit of shenanigans and fuckery, but yeah. Oh, that's good.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Anything else before I go die for a few hours?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing I can think of. I'm in the same boat here.

[Speaker 5]
Do we want to actually get to the tower, or is that best saved for another time?

[Speaker 1]
You guys needed to the tower. This was the area inside the tower, basically.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Like it's first level.

[Speaker 2]
How many heads can we get from this thing? And other general resources. Well, two heads were ripped off, I think.

[Speaker 1]
I think total of four. PB sliced off a total of three, and Rana sliced off one. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
What type of creature is the sugar off?

[Speaker 1]
It was originally an apparition. This one was undead.

[Speaker 2]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
This is not a real one, this is a mummified one. Okie dokie.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
You will absolutely be able to encounter one that is actually an apparition.

[Speaker 2]
Just out of curiosity, you know the... Nah, I'll ask you later, but I'll take one of the heads.

[Speaker 4]
No. Alright, you guys. It was very fun.

I'm going to go sleep. Goodnight.

[Speaker 5]
Thanks for joining.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks for playing.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, thanks for running. Thank you for running, yes.

[Speaker 1]
How did you guys like the head mechanic, out of curiosity?

[Speaker 5]
I always think that the head mechanic is fun. Hydras are one of my favorite enemies to fight and run, honestly.

[Speaker 2]
Quite entertaining. Oh yeah. I like the head mechanic.

And it was a little terrifying. It's a lot clearer than the Hydra one.

[Speaker 5]
I think I had an alternate interpretation you liked better than I think the way you had run it.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, no, absolutely correct, because I was like my impression was that you could cut off, you could deal a whole bunch of damage to it. I think your impression was that all the heads have to be off if you want it to all the heads have to be off if you want it to basically stay down. And I was running it as, well, you could kill it by you could kill it by removing all the heads, but more likely you're just going to kill it by reducing it to zero hit points because I was saying that it dies at zero hit points.

[Speaker 5]
It's always fun when things keep kicking after you bring it to zero. There is a really low level monster in Pathfinder. It's called a wild boar.

And it has the mechanic of it has to be brought to wounded three before it actually dies because they're just so angry.

[Speaker 1]
There's a similar one in fucking 5th Edition. I think you could ignore death if it's the only time I've seen the threshold mechanic used in 5th Edition. And it's probably made another appearance in like one other monster.

I'm sure there's a frog out there that uses this, but it's never appeared in any of the big guys.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, ferocity.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah. It just refuses to die.

Anyways, here's all the mechanics from the quote real shivergroth that were not used in this fight.

[Speaker 2]
Take 40 damage.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that would be very rude for me who is cursed by fire.

[Speaker 2]
Gemini crickets.

[Speaker 5]
I guess it's only dealt to half. I would get like double resistance to fire.

[Speaker 2]
How sweet. And almost immunity.

[Speaker 5]
I like the sound doing different types of damage based on the sound type. I absolutely have taken piercing damage during a fucking massage music song.

[Speaker 1]
That's not where I was expecting you to go with it.

[Speaker 5]
I hate singing bowls in massage music. I love them in real life, but in music they hurt.

[Speaker 2]
Like recordings of them. Right, the question I wanted to ask was, you know that dead mind flayer tadpole that I have gotten?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. Piercing damage during a massage. I can't.

I'm going to get myself in trouble. There's like three different jokes that are colliding at me right now. Oh man.

Okay, sorry. What were we discussing? What was your question?

[Speaker 2]
I was saying, so you know that dead mind flayer tadpole, right? Yes, if I resurrect that and then use my undead controlly thing and then put it in someone else, would I inevitably control the person? Or creature?

I put it in?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Sweet. Cool.

Rana has actually witnessed this.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, word?

[Speaker 1]
What Rana witnessed was a dead tadpole was placed into a teacher, animated. Oh yeah, I remember that. And then they killed the teacher and extracted the information out of the tadpole.

[Speaker 2]
I'll probably ask this a bit later, but No, I think that's all the questions for now. Yeah, just about the dead tadpole. Can you garner what type of dragon a dragon is just from their blood?

Or would you need more exonerating things?

[Speaker 1]
One sec. Make sure these charge so it's not connecting accidentally.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you would be able to figure it out from his blood.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, wouldn't you be able to use identify to do that? Or is that not what identify does? I never know what identify does.

[Speaker 1]
Identify normally doesn't do that. But that's a total difficult if you were to do if identify was to be your method of research during downtime.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, does dragon blood count as a magic item? Or a magic imbued object?

[Speaker 1]
It's magical in nature by any stretch of the imagination.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, technically that would be learning its properties, right? You could stretch that interpretation.

[Speaker 1]
If worse comes to worse, it's part of a downtime action.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see what this does. Who in camp wishes to speak with me? Oh, hi!

Garlak? Do a quick save. I have Baldur's Gate 3.

I really have Baldur's Gate 3.

[Speaker 2]
Have fun.

[Speaker 5]
My engine. We need to catch up with Danon. See if he's thought of a way to fix this thing.

Tell that to the Inferno where my heart was sold. Copper for your thoughts?

[Speaker 1]
Why the fuck is Halcyon taking damage? Everything in your mind that I am here to- I believe you when you tell me that your symptoms do not wholly align with the makings of the parasite. But, until we remove it, the Oakfather must have bled if I had my fleet of druids and a month of hard research.

Perhaps I could help, but I'm no savant. Somebody ask me a question? I'm sobering up right now.

[Speaker 5]
I just asked if you were in camp.

[Speaker 1]
I am in camp.

[Speaker 5]
He got stung by bees.

[Speaker 1]
I 100% believe that.

[Speaker 5]
I made Halcyon emojis for a friend of mine. That was nice. And one of them is him in a beehive party hat.

Understandable. But you're looking for solutions in the wrong places. Your parasite is unusual.

Until the source of the Tadpole's magic is- You are lucky that Halcyon knew that the parasites are merely a symptom of a greater sickness.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. I gotta do more mechanics like that. God, that fucking that fucking hip mechanic is so- Like, the more I think of this, I'm like, oh shit, I could make it so Marshals can, like, make a choice in the turn- Oh, do I wanna- Do I wanna hit this thing, or do I wanna give up my reaction?

Like, do I wanna keep my reaction for something else, or do I wanna potentially keep this thing from dealing more damage to me as time goes on? That's... probably good.

Should do that more often. At this point, it's fucking 5-8. Alright folks, I'm gonna hop off and get ready to go to bed.

But thank you for- Goodnight!

[Speaker 3]
Thanks for running.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody make sure to do the session report.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. Alright, peace everybody.

[Speaker 2]
Bye-bye.

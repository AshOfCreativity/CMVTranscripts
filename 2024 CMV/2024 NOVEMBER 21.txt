[Speaker 1]
All right, what do we got here? Oh, uh, you are, uh, so we got the quasar matter projector. Which one is the accurate one, or is it?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Sorry, I didn't know that we were, I didn't know that we were beginning, so.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what are you talking about? Okay, all right, it's just, uh, I see quasar matter projector. Oh, that's, okay, that's damage.

Cool, so I can just apply that. Excellent. I'm gonna have you re-roll the attack versus the guardian.

Still hits, nice. Why have I not applied the damage to him? You are correct.

Where is it? Here we go. No, we're still, what's he?

Oh, that's not great. He's not having a good time right now. Okay, I'll, I have to do, I have to do this guy here.

God, I have so many good choices. Okay, uh, no, we gotta do, we gotta do this lady, or else it's not gonna, I'm not gonna be able to use this again. Spread suffering, this is my favorite.

You choose.

[Speaker 2]
That is correct.

[Speaker 1]
All right, and nobody, uh, it's a tech attack that's happening versus you. Comet, go ahead and, uh, go ahead and attack with your lance, or do you still got a lance? What's that combat sheath do?

I, I virtually never get to see it. Two separate targets. Yeah, but like, what does, what does it do?

Hold on, I gotta, what damage does it do? What kind of damage does it do, is what I keep thinking. Okay, I, for some reason, I thought you had something that dealt burn on.

Uh, no, that's, just go ahead for the, uh, just use the tiger hunter, uh, sheath, that's fine. Yeah, you are going to take attack versus him, which we're not going to worry about, because he has wheat. Really, oh, wow, I am surprised.

Uh, chosen by the witch to attack a creature within, a character within range chosen by the witch, so no. Oh, that's fine. Uh, both of you, take two heat, and then I'm going to use teardown worms.

Comet, you take another four heat. No, he takes four heat. Hey, hey, hey, he takes four heat now, because he has a trade hacker for dealing additional heat.

Or she does. But her, if there's, it doesn't matter, because it's going to miss anyway, so we're not resolving that attack, because it's, we already know that it's going to miss, so to save time. Uh, when you, when you miss with the attack, okay, all right.

Yeah, I should have, all right, so you're going to take the four, so you take four from reliable. Wow, that is such a clever interaction. Okay, true silver.

After hitting with a weapon, the, I'm guessing there's a field analyst. Okay, it missed by four. Uh, voice of authority.

No, it does have a, yeah, because you, you're not able to, we'll say that you can't use your talents on it, but we'll say that, uh, Kennedy Thomas, uh, gets, but really it's you acting as commander here, so go ahead and re-roll it. NPCs are really entertaining next to the player characters. Friendly NPCs are awesome.

Okay, so you do hit. This is really good. Give me the full damage total, because I have something, uh, it will be, it will appear to do less damage than you were expecting.

Seven? Okay, very good. And then I don't think that I have anything else.

What do I have? Rodeo Master on there. This is like a, literally like a fucking hologram.

It's not supposed to be on there. How did you get on there? Just reload all your items.

All right, and I'm gonna have to remember my invisibility trait next time, but I did not remember it, so it does not exist. That would be the end, ooh. Now you guys already used your, eh, you know, Overwatch isn't like a single once per round.

No, but it is, but reactions are still once per round, right? So what is mind movement? Ooh, I can move a lot of places.

Indeed, both of you did. That is the end of her turn. Who'd like to go next?

It's at the beginning of her next turn. Remember, if there's, I'm gonna choose somebody. All right, go ahead, Calvin.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so were they gonna knock? Oh, okay. The pipe cleaners cannot stick them.

It doesn't, it can't, oh, the pipe, okay, sorry, the thing that they're running into. Can they? I don't think that they could be, no, because I think they could still be killed by this getting knocked into them.

That's fine. All right, so it's 1d6 kinetic, go ahead and roll. Jeez, okay, uh, even reduce is still enough to knock those guys out.

Very good. All right, that's the end of your turn. All right, time for me to start off with me.

I gotta do it. I have to, you're, you're here and you're grappling me, I have no choice. Exactly, he's, he's just a difficult, ooh, who else is talking, who else is grappling him right now?

This is the, you guys are gonna learn this, anybody who, like, goes out front and, like, starts tanking, uh, does, I indulge, I indulge these people. Uh, yeah, no, you cannot see it. All right, next time, and this is a really fun one.

No! I wanted it so much. Oh, I forgot to clear my heat, because I had not moved, even involuntarily, from the, uh, quest.

No, I just cleared the heat. You're supposed to clear it at the start of his turn. Ah, that would have been seven burn if I hit you, I would have been so happy about that.

Unfortunate. That is the end of his turn, who is up next? Okay, uh, oh, goodness, looking for the pintle, right?

Mm-hmm, one second, I'm just gonna, give me just a moment, folks. It is literally the exact same witch that you guys, uh, fought before. It's impaired, okay, let's put that, all right, sorry, somebody was, somebody asked me a question beforehand.

Ten did not hit, that would miss it by two. Uh, that was a ten to hit, that missed by one. Okay, let's see here, it's just four, that's just four kinetic, so we'll just apply that.

One armor, two, cool, all right, is that the end of the stun grunt, pardon? Yes, no, I applied, wait, the grunt, what? No, the guardian, no, the stun grunt is the thing that you're piloting.

Now, anyways, is that the end of your turn? I already applied, like I said, I already applied the damage. Thank you, all right, cool, cool, cool, you're fine, you're fine, I just wanted to clarify that.

Is anybody next to each other? No, oh, I'm not going to be able to, I do have to stand up in order to get moving here, that's fine. Medusa, I started right, she's going to stand up, got a clear approach, and then we're going to boost to begin moving over.

We're going to make, ooh, missed, I didn't apply accuracy, that's probably not going to matter. We're on, okay, all right, I'm not seeing. Okay, cool, that is the end of her turn.

Who wants to go next? The question is, do you want to use a bolster or skin immediately for the grass dog? Okay, that is hilarious.

It does provoke reactions if Overwatch has not been used by the main battle tank just yet. Yes, so the question is whether he wants to. Okay, it will be starting from engage, so that is plus one difficulty on the attack.

[Speaker 2]
Do you get that quick tech for free, or?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, all right, no, that makes it, that makes it a lot easier, cool. Oh, the Medusa, what, I remember what the problem was. Combat, you take an additional four heat, because it's excellent.

I'm totally having the Guardian go. We're going to use, all right, we're going to declare the bodyguard. Oh, wait, no, this is just a protocol.

Choose an ally character within range five is my ward, and I get the reflexive blow action. And then, yeah, this is going to be fun, okay. And move up.

Penrose, an obvious target. I'm going to use Eye of Midnight to become slowed, but it lets me Overwatch once per turn. Instead of once per round.

Fire, very good. Now, if you press the damage thing, I could apply resistance to both. Resist, will that do it correctly?

It did not, because it didn't take away the, uh, it didn't take away the armor, god damn it. It has one armor. I disagree.

It's, uh, all right. Oh, and I get to roll for this.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, that sucks.

[Speaker 1]
No, do it. All right, Prince, Black Fox, or Phantom Whisperer. Ah, so Prince or Black, or Phantom Whisperer.

Because he accidentally just put him on there a second time, that's unfortunate. All right, Prince or Nark? So be it.

Also, you have additional plus one difficulty on tech attacks against her. Take off the Impaired, because she finished her turn. Yeah, you would, you would add, like, plus one difficulty, so that's like, um, that's fine.

Now, which is the Quick Tech, Miss Buy? Uh, Misses Buy, three. Very good, very good.

I have a bunch of people to use over here now. Oh, I like this searching guy. You already used your reaction, or your overwatch earlier this.

Oh, wait, no, no, you didn't use overwatch, you just used a reaction. Right. No, you can't react more than once per turn.

You have one reaction, you have one reaction per turn, not one reaction per round. Overwatch just has a react restriction that keeps you from doing it. Oh, you are within.

All right, I need the Tank and Black Fox to make the hull saves.

[Speaker 4]
Really?

[Speaker 1]
And then there was the Aids from the, uh, from the Micro Missiles. I don't know how much over she'll be at access to. Delicious.

[Speaker 2]
Hunker Down!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, 100% use Hunker Down. A 19 would also hit the Assault. In case you were feeling baffled.

It does have armor. So if you're referencing something, you want to, you want to pop it in the chat if it's, um, let's see if it applies the armor. Oh, it does apply the armor.

All right, cool. All right. Huffle Underslung.

Delightful Little Shithead. All right, that brings us to whoever the last person up is. Uh, you're going to have a lot less opportunity to do it if you have to use a Scan or Bolster for the Turn-By Committee.

Yeah, I, I don't, again, it's, if you guys want to go for it, that's fine. It's, uh, overcharge and, uh, it's kind of funny. Sure, are you moving twice or what's...

I... Right, but once you get within one of this guy, you're going to be engaged. So that's where your movement's going to end.

Or, well, where your first movement's going to end. All right, well, now I have to do things like locate your movement. I guess you're also climbing on top of an object.

So you could reduce two from your current movement. I'm not going to make a...

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's, all you had to do was, uh, spend the extra, like, two movement climbing on top of the size two object and then going over. I'm not going to charge you extra movement for falling off something.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. That's what I should have saved, uh, hunker down for. You already did use true silver earlier today on the Medusa.

But then somebody else turned it into a hit, remember? Or we had you re-roll it, so it was against the witch, right? No, it turned it into a...

Or we turned it into a crit. Yes. If we scroll all the way up, we will see it.

[Speaker 2]
Which is fine, because, like, don't worry about it. You used it on a good target.

[Speaker 1]
Just, just go ahead and roll the damage. And then, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, reduce the... Wait, what? I'll, I'll take care of the armor.

Don't worry about that. Um, okay. Yeah, can it be enough?

I have no idea. All right, can only clear Perun when it... If it makes it a B2.

Or meets a B2. All right.

[Speaker 2]
Very cool.

[Speaker 1]
All right, anything else on your turn? Okay. I'm gonna have the...

Right. Oh, right. If I do this, I'm gonna slow the grenade launcher.

However, it would, it would hurt me quite significantly. Wait, no, I don't have to do... Yeah, I don't have to do it right here, though.

I could do it over this way. Uh, and I will have additional difficulty, because I am engaged. What, I'm not trying to hit the pipe cleaners.

Get that out of the air. It's your emperor's fault for existing. It's, uh, oh, clearly, it's not going to...

All right. There we go. Okay.

Additional difficulty. We are rolling good today. Sometimes, except for, like, when I really, really need it.

It's always on the NPCs that I do not expect. And is there a way for me to... Is there a way for this vehicle to, like...

Is there something I can roll to clear the grapple? I don't... Or I move you.

Uh, screw it. I'll, I'll try to do a... I'll try to do a full check.

I think it's... I think you get to roll versus me. You have to be able to.

No, I didn't think he was. He's just, like, spinning his wheels right now. I got that.

That's the end of his turn. Oh, that's right. I still have...

Burr!

[Speaker 2]
Ah, ha ha ha ha! The ten bird!

[Speaker 1]
And then I have... Ooh, I have you. Oh, not exotic.

Where's my operator thing? If somebody... Whoever's chewing into the mic, I will kill your family.

Oh, ha ha ha! No, I can do that later. For the moment, I have a stat.

Greetings! Give me a second. I'm going to, uh...

[Speaker 4]
Don't fucking edit. The screaming there. Ten minutes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna attack you guys with the... Raptor plasma rifle. That's true.

Let's apply, like, uh, soft cover to you for it. Make it easier. Oh, I can also do that menu.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Hello. Jeez. Oh, so this cannot be reduced in any way?

In case you were thinking of doing... If in case you were thinking of doing... I don't know.

Something like a brace or something like that. It will not help you. Oh, my bad.

Oh, shit. I should have been using that thing way more often last time. Oof.

I don't think he's immune to eat damage now. Why do I... Why do I keep thinking that the operator is supposed to be invisible?

Wait, where are you... I didn't apply the damage yet. Wait, no, I did apply the damage.

Hold on a second. Um, where did I apply the damage from? Oh, wait, no.

So I didn't apply the damage yet. Okay. Here we go.

This confused me because you were like... Oh, god, it must be... Oh.

God damn it.

[Speaker 2]
See, this is why you guys don't like... Hey! Like, fuck...

Just get... everybody calm down. Everybody calm down!

[Speaker 1]
No, he's just going to be... He's going to be a wreck moving around the, uh... Unbelievable.

Okay, and so he took... What was he adding? Seven, so he takes four.

All right. Cool. All right, he's still there, still chilling.

They don't. It's just everything's fucked now. So now the pipe cleaners are going.

Uh, they're gonna climb. Use their movement to climb, and then they're going to boost. Get up to 10 spaces here.

And they're going to fire at the stunned grunt. Speaking of which, can you make the stunned grunt... I would like you to point the stunned grunt at, like, its current facing.

So we know where it has the... Where it has its armor. You click it, and then you hold control, and then just roll your mouse button.

All right, you're pointing towards the witch. Yeah, I don't think it's going to... It's not going to bypass the six armor, then.

You want to, like, uh, point it directly at the witch, though. Go, pick up... It did, like, we don't have another choice.

All right, remove... Remove activation. Cool.

Those guys are done. Let's start a round three. I mean, I'm adding shit to the, uh, I'm adding shit to reinforcements here, so...

Well, hold on, let me finish answering... Asking the question first, before people assume, because... Fitties.

No, they do appear every segment, I just haven't put them down yet. I'm letting you guys, uh, discuss strategy while I put stuff. No.

It's the Wicked Witch of the East. There were. There was a, uh, a guardian, and then there was a, uh, the operator.

No, they're both still alive. It's only for tech attacks. All right, we have Grunt.

Avengers coming through. All right, and this will be our last round tonight. Um, if the combat, if the combat, uh, does not end, then we will just pick it up, uh, next, uh, next session with, you know, obviously going a lot faster, because it won't be, we won't be dealing with a bunch of broken modules.

And speaking of which, so you guys get to discuss. Let me know before you start going, um, that'll be, I'll be listening. I'm starving.

Don't just discuss who goes first. Discuss, like, the plan. Last thing I forgot to mention is, if you guys succeed this fight, you can choose to extract and succeed the mission, uh, for this one, because you'll be able to extract the Beksinski with everything you need.

You guys can go around the base and start wrecking it. It depends on whether you guys want to get to licensed level six. No, I'm saying, I'm saying mission success, if you extract.

All right, so we're grappling the witch. Oh boy, you're attacking my ward. Oh boy.

It's incredible. Give me a fucking second. Hold on a second.

Well, let me go look at the, no, their vision is, uh, they're, they missed by, what did all of them miss? No, only the one missed. Okay, uh, the one that missed, missed by three.

Did they get, um, chaff, revenge? Oh, hold on a second. An allied non-grunt or non-drum character.

Ah, I gotcha. Okay, very good. I have not used them before.

Now, I love sending grunts. I feel bad when I'm putting a bunch of, like, uh, regular NPCs on the board. Yeah, it, the witch already failed hers earlier.

I rolled that. Uh, she got a, she got a 17. And we're starting at seven.

Not 17. So be it. Oh, ah, he is within threat of the, yes.

That scourer is still up as well, if you want to damage him. Is that guardian really a one-hit?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the one who's also gone. No! Can you hit something within full cover, or?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not saying hard cover. I mean, like, full cover. Okay.

When I say cover, I do mean full cover. But I don't know if that's, like, I should double check to see if it's an actual term. Well, I'm not saying hard cover.

I'm saying, like, very specifically, not saying hard cover.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
The wall? Sorry, where? No, it's not height one.

It's, like, height six. Or something high. I already applied the two damage.

That's fine. Okay. Oh, boy.

They have a surprisingly high hull. Oh, man. I don't...

Uh, can't grapple a ram. But it doesn't say anything about, like, um... Well, can't grapple a ram.

Oh, right. Okay. Let's see.

Right, right. I think they could be knocked around. Nice that we get...

We do get pulled adjacent. That's amazing. Yeah, that will kill them.

Ah, you two aren't adjacent to each other. That sucks. Sorry, go ahead.

To stop it without adjacent... I mean, yeah, that'd be fine. I'm not gonna pixel bitch it.

I mean, I could do that. Burn is not a condition. Uh, immobilized and engaged are.

So I'm gonna do that, and then I'm just gonna... It is going to overwatch me.

[Speaker 3]
I know.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Now you can actually target. Oh, no shot.

No, because that gets reduced to four. AP doesn't mean a... AP doesn't mean shit to this thing.

It does have... Yeah, welcome to exotics.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Put that to...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no!

[Speaker 1]
If you move next to that surgeon, you are... This guy is still alive. Okay, that's fine.

Oh, you're fine with it? Is that to damage, or is that to hit? 12 will just hit.

I thought that's what you pointed it to. That's my bad. Wait, no, that's mine.

Whenever I move it like this, it shows me the... Okay, that's its movement history. What do you think?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think that you get to make the engineer... Yeah, but like, what is it for?

[Speaker 1]
The objective is a quick action. It's at the end of your next turn. No, you still have your quick action.

Go, go. All right. Oh, you said that's the end of your turn?

All right. Well, I believe you can, yeah. Let's go with...

I think this would be useful. Let's go. Now, speaking of which, you said...

Is this thing grappled right now, or like, what happened? Oh, no, I'm fine with it invoking an attack of opportunity. I've been not pressing this for, like, the past...

[Speaker 4]
Retarge.

[Speaker 1]
I kept telling myself I would do it. Like, I mentioned it at the start of combat. Like, all right, next round, I'm gonna remember.

And then it just never mattered. You do still get the chance to make... To do that.

It is. I will be moving in a moment. I'm trying to decide on...

Oh. Good, good question. So they are moving.

Well, hold on a second, because you're... You got to make the attack by virtue of it moving. No, it's...

It's going through you. Yes, okay. Oh, okay.

All right, so if I do that... So I go here, and then engage again. So what I gotta do is I gotta boost.

And then I'll be adjacent to one of you two. Unless I go this way. Yeah, I could do that.

Let's see what happens. Oh, I have to get in shape. Yeah, there we go.

No, I have very simple things in mind.

[Speaker 4]
Really?

[Speaker 3]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
I totally forgot about that. Shoot, how long does it... I gotta remember how long that was for next time.

Yeah, because it goes to the next attack. That's brilliant. Oh yeah, no, the roll was still going to be...

Because I rolled a natural four. That was not going to help me at all. But that is the end of its turn.

Oh, I get to roll it. It's weird. It just does nothing.

[Speaker 3]
That's crazy.

[Speaker 1]
It is now un-invisible. That reminded me. So it doesn't...

The module doesn't catch it. There we go. Indeed.

It is the armored personnel carrier. It does not have a... It does not have a rack inside.

It just has the... It just has the unshielded fusion core. Yeah, so the only one that you have like a...

You'll make a flat roll against Medusa and a plus one accuracy versus everybody else. Yeah, if he holds shift, you could do it the same way.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, because they take... They die as soon as they take heat. He's multijasking because he has to get next to him.

Which is fine. It does. E-Defense is 10.

You can now. Because you just scanned it. So it has 4 HP and it currently has 2 heat.

Hey, hey. He's starting. Hey, hey.

Tic-tac-toe. Ooh. Go to the current heat.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. They do have 4 hit points. And now I've taken structure damage.

On the reactor meltdown, pull that... Whoever answers, pull that directly off CompCod.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, and roll your tech against the... Roll your tech versus the vehicle as well. Puppet systems.

[Speaker 1]
He has already overwatched this round. But... You are correct.

I'm wrong. Shit.

[Speaker 2]
He's not there. There's a great deal of... Many problems were had over that particular subject.

No, that was rough. And he still rolled an 8.

[Speaker 1]
The, uh... You could bully your tank friend into giving it to you. All right, for, uh...

Tic-tac-toe. 2 heat for a total of 4 heat. Nice.

Does not take it past its heat cap. But gosh, it was really close. Oh, pipe cleaner, actually.

All right, uh... Surgeon is the only guy on here.

[Speaker 2]
What do we got, big man?

[Speaker 1]
I would target the Emperor. Absolutely. Wow, he's not there right now.

Oh, ah! I think I took, uh... I just switched, whatchamacallit.

That's my movement. 5? No!

Of course not. What's the point of a two-segment clock...

[Speaker 2]
If it only takes one hit to blow it up?

[Speaker 1]
You use press the attack to shoot him. Right. But you get to use the reaction versus him.

That's like, that gives you an eligible target. That's my understanding of it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm pretty sure that's gonna... Yeah. Wait, am I?

No, no, I'm also dead. It just didn't, um... I had 3 hit points and that would have brought it down to...

It's a destabilized power plant made it think that I was not also dead. It's a shame because I missed against the, uh... The Death Nation soon.

But it's still there for, you know, the start of next turn. No, it was just to stop it from getting to the extraction zone. Which you guys did masterfully.

Indeed. Right now I think your objective is to get the... The core away from Prince, who does not get the opportunity to move at the moment.

Um... You can... It's exploding.

I don't think... That's a really interesting question for something that says Dead Nation soon. You would not make it in EOD.

It's... That's the worst thing to say to an active countdown. It says...

Why are you saying please let me... Oh, I thought you already went. That's my bad.

Oh, okay. Then you guys are fine then. Go on, do your thing.

Why are you asking... It's not your turn. Prince is going.

If you want to... Guys, if you have questions for like stuff like that, you can ask in the, uh... In the chat.

Um... And if we want to like recap at the end of somebody's turn while I'm like deciding which NPC thing to do, then that... That usually goes pretty well.

I usually catch it if you... If you ask in a counter chat. All right, Prince.

But the rest of your turn?

[Speaker 3]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
It's crits for days. I'm loving this. Somebody said that Medusa here had like six turns and did not get predatory logic once.

Back once. That was a shame. Yeah, I suppose they're just getting like knocked in every which way.

Uh, it's at plus two difficulty, but you do have plus one difficulty from... Uh, from prone, yes. Do you have another thing that gives you plus one accuracy?

Right, right. Reliable brings it down to... When you press roll damage, it'll bring, uh...

It'll proc the reliable damage. Cool. All right, it's got five hit points left, so can anybody do ten damage?

Yes. Do you mind? The stun grunt is currently within the blast radius.

[Speaker 2]
Stun grunt?

[Speaker 1]
Do you? Oh, I thought it was once per round. Yeah, it's...

It's once per round, not once per turn. I told you how many hit points it has left. You're like, I'm gonna take it back.

I gotcha. All right, stun grunt. Are you flying?

Or, uh, you're gonna be a boy? What? Okay.

It's swooping time. You have plus one accuracy on it. So it is...

Um... Well, there's a... Yeah, all right.

If you roll the... Damn. All right.

All right. Uh, it matters a little bit. Roll the...

Okay. Did you not roll... Okay.

And then you can overcharge. Which is always 1d6 for you. So just, um...

You don't have any heat right now. So just roll the attack. Or whatever you can do.

[Speaker 2]
Ah! Just roll the attack! It's, uh...

[Speaker 1]
I appreciate your commitment to... Oh my god. Great damage.

Correct. So, uh, start of the next round. What do you got for me?

All right, Comet. So, you rejected? Indeed.

And so, man... This guy has one hit point left. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
F.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that was amazing. Never had to be in combat. You also still do have boost and stuff like that.

You can boost the pilot. No, it explodes at the start of the next round. Nobody was within range.

So that's why I did not, um... All right. So you guys will have a not quite capital ship.

But a ship... Nevertheless, for the purposes of your... Oh, nice.

All right. The Beksinski is a destroyer. It has only ever been referenced as a destroyer in every single...

I know! You should stop doing that! We'll see.

Yes, because I threatened you with the... I threatened your action economy. Which turned out to be the right call.

Because you could still... Because here's the thing. Scan and bolster are actually still good actions.

I love them. I love using them for NPCs who I don't know what to do. I just finally found that right threshold of like, all right, what will...

What do you value more? It's like, wait, which do you want to... Which do you want to min-max?

The turn or the... The turn or the strategy? And they're both valid choices.

But I have a rough idea of which one you're going to choose. The Detroit is not even a corvette. It is a shuttle.

Uh, the corvette... So, uh, there is a corvette that's described with no room for a wallflower. It's 130 meters long, right?

The HMS Detroit is probably about a hundred meters long. Can you fit that in? The Detroit and the Beksinski.

Not according to the flight plan that I gave you. Because the Beksinski is probably... Why that person's responding that way.

The Beksinski is not much longer. It is taller. Actually, why am I saying that the HMS Detroit is like...

No, so the corvette is... Hmm. Let me think about that.

You can... Because the Beksinski did have a rather small ship that fit inside it. But it's not really made for carrying other ships.

But that's fine. What you do is you just... You have somebody else pilot the ship in a formation with the Beksinski.

Uh, so Captain... There's only one of you who remember this guy. Captain Greggs Haldit is in orbit.

When you guys end up launching the Beksinski, you are able to fire off the antimatter rockets without a hitch. You get a transmission from Lisa Carter saying that she's... Well, we'll go over her transmission some other time.

But Captain Greggs Haldit is happy to see you. He's been transporting the station parts. So there's a bunch of construction drones and subalterns working on it.

It's going to start off as a relatively small minor spaceport. But they'll be able to collect fuel pretty easily from the nearby gas giant. Lisa Carter was asking you to do so.

IPSN has asked you to take control of Solani R&D as a... As a kind of side objective or a natural extension of taking over this system. IPSN took over the adjacent system, the Marne sector.

If I go to the sector map... Activate. Here we go.

There's Marne and then Dagan. It's actually Dagan because this system map is getting updated. The local IPSN administrator is Donovan Granigan.

Oh, the CHK winter contract. They can give you some information on that. There's an MSMC fleet around that area.

And there were some other... There was actually another active pilot mission that went dark around that area. They were supposed to...

Another IPSN affiliated group was supposed to take watch over your... Was supposed to take watch over the MSMC flight that was heading towards the winter contract. And they lost contact.

The fleet is still active, but the rear guard that actually went towards the winter contract And the attache, or the unknown attache, I guess. Nobody's heard from either of them. So there is just a ghost ship out there.

So you guys, in the meantime, I'm gonna check on my food that's been warming up. But besides that, good session. You guys...

Those are some nasty fucking enemies that you guys took out. Thank you. No, they haven't.

It's the station that's friendly to you. Because one of your people has brought on a friendly... One of your people has brought on the station.

Or brought the station here to be constructed. And their charge, or their charter, you could say. Their under-the-table charter is take this system.

IPSN doesn't want to have control over this system, because then they're on the hook for turning over research related to any kind of materials that Horizon might have been working on. But if it's an unidentifiable contractor that's hanging out here. And they don't have to worry about it.

That's correct. Yep. No, literally exactly that.

And say for the contractor doesn't... You guys are basically in a similar legal gray space right now to most of MSMC's... Well, I shouldn't say most, but MSMC's more lucrative contracts.

Exactly. Well, I'm gonna check on my food. I have my headphones in though, so if you have any questions or other clarifications you want, I will be able to hear them.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, in favor...

[Speaker 1]
Phineas, if you look at your build, you actually do have a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. That shit is excellent for AOE attacks. And I think that you built it pretty smart going...

You didn't have as much opportunity to use your weapons, but I think you did the smart thing building it so that you have a... You have like... You have a good mix of...

Like your weapons are mostly AOE and then you have your... And your hacking is mostly single target. So whenever you have...

When you... Whenever you end up really needing AOE, because like the rest of your party is indisposed or something like that, or it just would be better than hacking an individual big guy, you're going to be well suited to respond. Mmm.

[Speaker 2]
Pleasure playing with you. Very nicely done.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. Mmm.

[Speaker 1]
Mmm. Phineas, for a first Lancer session, and doing it at License Level 5, which is pretty insane for a new player, that was really good.

[Speaker 2]
That was really good. Those are systems.

[Speaker 1]
And each of them has their own individual plays, so... The Dagon system I've been doing a lot of work on, because that's where the one-shot module for this December's Game Jam is going to take place. So I have a lot of work done on that.

What? Yeah, no, you guys are in a... You guys are in the Dagon system.

That's correct. Yeah, that'd be excellent, actually. Ditto for the Beksinski.

Somebody's got to come up with one. That's fine. Pilot combat and pilot theater.

I personally, I love jumping out of mechs and doing shenanigans while the mech is acting. You're in a position where you could have your mech... You have your mech still do a bunch of fighting and benefit from your talents, even while you were out and about.

And given that there's going to be a bunch of situations where stepping out of your mechs is either going to be useful and or necessary. Everybody loves Lucyrus. He is a good NHB.

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think there's any native images that work. Oh, goodness. I know which one you're referring to.

I can't remember what the heart of the Midlothian actually looks like, though. You all as well. Thank you for playing.

It was pleasant to play with you guys. Hell yeah. I have not heard anything from Lance.

Because that is just the way of Lancer games, is people stop playing or stop responding and just do not say anything about it. There is nothing wrong with too many artillery. Exactly.

That's a mobile artillery. It's very localized artillery.

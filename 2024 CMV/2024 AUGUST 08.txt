[Speaker 1]
We'll see, I'm okay if they don't show up like immediately because I got until like 5.30 CST They got five and a half hours Before I go on WIC TV and start discussing start slamming WOTC 5.5 That's the idea and besides that I believe that we're doing a, correct me if I'm wrong, we're doing a brilliant session today Yep, yes, we're in space before blast Excellent.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Um, I have a couple quick questions if that's okay So you said to hatch a friendly dragon. I have to surround it with things that have friendly vibes Like stuffed animals like Kairona's old breastplate because it protected her Describe friendly vibes.

[Speaker 1]
So friendly vibes. It also has to be something of value, right? so it's a stuffed animal probably wouldn't work a Breastplate that protected somebody if it was particularly expensive would probably assist in that regard.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's mithril Yeah, no, that's that that'd be perfect Expensive and friendly. I love it

[Speaker 6]
Is dragons about a bunch of stuffed animals and a bunch of money

[Speaker 1]
No, because the stuffed animals need to be the trinkets themselves also have Dragons This world dragons, but they're valuable to me and their alignment while they're in It's just that they usually choose the I mean they usually don't even choose like different Different even if they're good dragons and they have good parents. They normally don't choose Different nominally then we don't choose different scale colors from the parents because it would upset them and potentially Potentially result in death.

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 8]
You already got that Obviously Maelstrom does not agree with you There you go I Res is here. I'm going to make sure that my wallet is secure and then we shall begin I'm gonna act hard They're online Okay, buddy, I gotta go do a case Onto the bed Yellow Hello My audio is dying one sec Well, how's everyone doing pretty good me

[Speaker 6]
Why do you have to sound so creepy

[Speaker 2]
What I'm not That was radio voice Hello

[Speaker 6]
It literally sounded like you're trying to be like some gremlin in someone's ears like some Igor somewhere

[Speaker 2]
Reminded me of like the 10 p.m. Or the 12 a.m. Radio like calm Calming.

[Speaker 5]
Hello. I'm your host res. Yeah If I were to ever DM a session I would use that voice the whole time Well Um, it's been a while since I played Doesn't feel like it's been a while, but I know it has yeah, it's been like over two weeks.

[Speaker 6]
I Almost feel like it's been a month for me It's been a hot minute I'm glad I'm gonna get this session in because I'm gonna be so busy from here on out my weekend class My weekend client just had surgery. So I'm gonna have to see them twice a week from here for a little while It's like no my free time But money But money but free time No, I got you.

[Speaker 1]
I am Similar Well, I'm not in a similar boat. I have to like really pull the trigger on that Kate Lancer game again yes, now I'm working part-time at my current job That is not How I activate this?

[Speaker 8]
Ah, yes go to the be activated but People are not loading in

[Speaker 1]
As we love their heroes It was something about you guys had finished off at the skybox and you were preparing to secure travel to the Osram hub

[Speaker 6]
I thought we had we were just waiting for 10 days

[Speaker 5]
yeah, this place I don't remember this did I not participate in the

[Speaker 6]
Brilliant you did you did I remember because I was threatening to Banish your character and he didn't get shit together.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Do you remember playing a skyship and running it?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, I remember Your character was being a jerk He was just failing repeatedly, which is a Jerkness How dare I fail I Would I would say not thinking things through definitely was a part of that earlier remember as they're not gonna forgive you Apologies right you get like you get to with them That's about it. Everything else is just I made a mistake and I will not be doing it again But but sorry, you only get two of those Uh Got seven toes, which is why I don't think I've ever used a sorry We can still ditch you in a hole again and leave you Hole So I'm gonna activate the world map.

[Speaker 4]
So it yanks everybody over and then I'm gonna activate blank Yank everyone over again Oh Get moved around Is anybody willing to loan me some magical items with good vibes?

[Speaker 2]
Um, I can see if I have anything. I forgot my sound joy isn't working.

[Speaker 4]
So I have It also be art pieces or art pieces or expensive non magical items I just don't want to have to strip down to nothing to hatch this little buddy I have a glitter gland that I like to squeeze it.

[Speaker 7]
It's a hundred gold pieces Does that count as friendly?

[Speaker 4]
Sure, every little bit helps. I mean, I think a stress ball counts as friendly.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I mean I took it from a glitter wyvern, but You know, it's friendly now when I use it

[Speaker 4]
I Rona has taken over one of the hammocks below decks and it's lined with soft blankets just in case but then it's also got this crazy collection of The unicorn staff is there for old mithril breastplate is there Good vibes as in friendly So like the breastplate is there because it's How long does you have to be in the horde

[Speaker 1]
With a little horde like that is it's for its hatching board

[Speaker 2]
Is it gonna want to keep it forever?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah

[Speaker 2]
No, I Didn't know that my apologies I can see I mean, this is a perfect time for us to see what we need to get rid of

[Speaker 8]
Okay

[Speaker 7]
Drum it's not expensive, but she hopes that it will at least make the dragon appreciate music

[Speaker 1]
Now my understanding is that you guys decided to hitch hitch arrive at the shipping company On your way over to the Ostrom hub

[Speaker 8]
Yes That does sound right I'm gonna use the Use the whale ship It loads here's to be struggling Just open those in the background Boo-doo-doo-doo I Can't zoom in on my founder What are you doing use my macros Okay, I'm back

[Speaker 6]
My dad is trying to make me go to the store

[Speaker 8]
Shut up I have D&D True priorities, so now I have to think of what I want to make for dinner.

[Speaker 1]
I did get that insta pot Have you made anything in it yet?

[Speaker 4]
Oh Let me send you a link Please do send me send me all the recipes Oh My dad and I use this Instant pot well pressure cook instant pot recipe site It's they've got recipes for almost everything and a lot of Asian stuff Interesting.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, hey, I've used this one before Oh Japanese potato salad. I need to instantly just grab that and steal it.

[Speaker 7]
I Love Japanese potato salad Potato salad doesn't have meat in it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it's basically like mashed potatoes I think this recipe does have meat, but you don't necessarily have to put it in there

[Speaker 7]
I have so many things that I can use to replace meat

[Speaker 2]
I have deceivers lingerie that the dragon could have I

[Speaker 8]
Don't know if that's does it have friendly vibes

[Speaker 3]
Do you want to give that to a dragon like

[Speaker 2]
Here as a mermaid it just will make you look like a mermaid I Have never gotten the chance to use it so and that's the only thing that a Valuable a value that I am willing to part with

[Speaker 4]
Can you link it in chat or something?

[Speaker 7]
I could try One day you're gonna be able to use it and it's gonna be fucking fantastic To drag it out here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay every time so I tried dropping the whale down and it's not letting me Be the way up. Can you guys see the whale?

[Speaker 8]
No, I'm supposed to be oh Oh dear, I think it broke I see Are we supposed to have a token down I Don't have a token down.

[Speaker 1]
It's just I think I tried placing the whale ship down on the scene I think despite being on the blank thing.

[Speaker 3]
I'm seeing the overworld map except that it froze for me. So it Something is definitely broken There we go Yeah, I I don't have a token so I wouldn't be able to see anything any black screen should I just drop a token see Our screen is now gray.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go ahead and drop a token.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, oh, it was black for a minute and now it's gray Yeah, it's just a gray grid This one is playing Did you delete the ship token no, I can't I'm very scuffed. All right. Hope everybody's ready If this one's not gonna break yeah, there we go Must oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
It's so me Only be though. It must only be the whale show.

[Speaker 8]
There's no other explanation Behold our whale Massive token Interesting.

[Speaker 7]
So what is this?

[Speaker 1]
So the dull whale is a roughly whale shaped object a whale shaped ship will say It's curved. It has a few different Paintings of the sea on its side and as you guys get ready to enter the astral tides You can see these are reflecting against The portal that's beginning to open in front of you It's reflecting on this painting in a way that makes it seem like it move says the tides shimmer That's cool. It's very large.

It holds a great deal of cargo It's a large cyclopean eye on the front that serves as both a weapons Weapon station and there's a kind of like central command CIC if you will Hey So they're moving forward They're generating this portal. I believe that the only person who's seen a border like this before was probably Probably para as cobalt's come from a different world.

[Speaker 8]
They come from the world by on and the ship begins moving through

[Speaker 1]
you're thrust into a fairly shallow river It looks as if you could see the bottom which is just nothingness but the water itself is Small enough to or the the water itself is like Steady enough to like dip a toe into It's a few of the sailors on the side do so as they you know, they get a few water boards out It's cool, but not too cold. It's just everybody experiences it as a you know, just a very neutral temperature it's almost it's almost exactly coordinated with your internal temperature Coordinated correlated with your internal temperature almost perfectly matches and above you is the stars and you can see all of them meaning this place is incredibly bright despite the fact that it's It's dark all the coloring of everything is dark.

You can see Everything nearby almost perfectly There's practically no shadows here.

[Speaker 4]
Anybody have a fiction word. I Will chat I do I've got a fancy fishing rod Bring in someone Yes, I do And you got a planet from it.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yes. I remember you're very cool fishing rod Mine isn't that fancy.

[Speaker 1]
It's just it's just a regular pole of angling More cool is going to take you folks aside while he's while you guys are getting ready and sort of taking in the sights He says okay What I'd like to do now is I've been preparing these buoys. Thanks to my recent Thanks to my recent like dealings I have been receiving a bunch of buoys that we can leave behind and These buoys are going to make it easier for us to get back I'm also gonna make it so I can sort of sear the planes a little bit and Yank some people through so if you have any other like people that there are other adventures associates that you want to bring with you. I Can yank them through and then we can go back to?

Way back, it'll be a lot easier.

[Speaker 8]
We will be able to teleport in here instantly All right, then There's gonna make a couple of stops a little bit I paid the captain advance for this Since we were in time jail if I brought Merrill through would it be free or post dragon Was Merrill in time jail? No, we were in time jail Are you guys in the astral tides aren't in time jail?

[Speaker 1]
I Just I just gave you some extra time for like hey, it's gonna take them ten days So if you want to do something then you can oh, okay There's no time jail in the astral tides.

[Speaker 2]
If there's the time works differently I do have My Ranger Friend Yes, Orion and my little Wyvern We didn't bring a lot of like people with us to like we had like 50 higher Which I think is the idea I For one I'm an amazing captain no You don't get to fly this ship I could bring I could bring one of my people I could bring my paladin or monk I screwed just went dark.

[Speaker 4]
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna reset the server It's misbehaving right now, I'm primarily bringing Merrill over because Kairona keep in touch. And so Kairona knows that Merrill has a bunch of spare fancy art items from the ice track and Hey, do you want to see almost space the only trick is you have to give me stuff So when you say bring people over That much money Like teleport them Basically or plane ship them to be more specific Right.

[Speaker 5]
So if I were to do that, why be controlling multiple player characters for the session or were you thinking more like hirelings? You can do either one.

[Speaker 6]
I Think it's a failsafe in case like somebody who wasn't on the original brilliant session wanted to join Okay, that's exactly it.

[Speaker 8]
No, if you wanted you actually brought like a character along he didn't he did not It's not loaded Bro, what is going on with you today? Who goes there is that Phineas it's not I Not even gonna try it Say that one Yeah, I don't Know what our little cryptid got banned There was a user that just had the name I and they would just join for a while and then leaves Actual cryptid Okay, so now I think the server is back up Yeah, let's try this critical failure Yes, you are in the middle of something.

[Speaker 5]
It is a session Yeah, I was going I'm guessing you guys are doing with technical difficulties. I just thought it'd be cool. I expect it if cool Yeah, that's totally fine Awesome.

[Speaker 8]
I Won't be here too long.

[Speaker 1]
But yeah, let's just be quiet while we're in the middle of a session.

[Speaker 8]
All right Next month interest me I think so.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm gonna go use the restroom. I'm gonna wait for you guys to log back in while everybody And Once that's done we're gonna jump into a combat We also smacking thing I'm gonna guess we had a long rest by now.

[Speaker 8]
Yes. Yes. Yes ten moments and very long rest I Love long rests So are we doing today Ideally 48,000 XP I Exactly Make a fucking enemy that if it hits you you gain XP.

[Speaker 2]
I Drew from the deck of many things last week and Yeah card that gave us a level up right after the next enemy we killed Didn't matter size or whatever.

[Speaker 5]
So we killed a coin mimic It's not the size that matters It's how hard you use it Everyone is afraid Terrified yeah, what is a man?

[Speaker 3]
Be careful not to get eaten I don't think anyone has the ability to find you if void against you is it void that locks you away somewhere Well, she can find intervention, yeah, it's probably divine intervention someone free.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah Okay, is there any point in doing your show? It depends on who it is The monk who's really good at flying the ship.

[Speaker 6]
No, he would stay there.

[Speaker 5]
He would stay there Well, if I can bring other people in I could bring Zakira along.

[Speaker 2]
Oh We need to too many people I was I was tempted to bring some an extra person long, but I was just like would that be Too many Unidentified loot unidentified loot unidentified loot unidentified the monk has four unidentified loot Yeah, you heard of Unidentified Unidentified consumable, what are you looking in? I did you forget to mark them off as identified? Yeah, all you have to do is um edit them and I'd like click the toggle the Wood though, I'm tempted to just leave them Yeah, a bunch of my loot has also seemed to have gone unidentified It's just a torch Consumable Rations, that's funny.

My shit got messed up. That means they're They're probably they probably need to be thrown out Yeah, if your rations are unidentified Just a block of food you have no idea what's in it.

[Speaker 6]
How did that happen?

[Speaker 2]
How do you always do this? I don't know My mess kit I have a mess kit that's cool. I feel like he's going to his inventories for the first time Got a tinderbox Insignia of rank.

Oh, you can give that to the dragon. Only if it has good vibes. Oh Then he's just gonna destroy it Good vibes What's he destroying his insignia of rank that he got Because rank to what to who?

To his backstory.

[Speaker 5]
Oh If you throw it off the ship and it's shiny and carries it's gonna fly after it Yeah, if James allows it I can have both corpus and Sakura Which I'd actually prefer because I like controlling it kind of tank character change the monks Look my monk can still deal damage Okay, if he can actually get close enough to punch something if you know, that's it I feel like it's gonna be a lot of rain.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I don't know It was kind of a mix of range Do we know how far down the drop is into the water You will die.

[Speaker 3]
Just imagine you will die.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, it's a it's an astral sea An astral sea so I can't walk on it No At 9th level you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and to cross liquids on your turn without falling during the move only I Don't know if it counts as a liquid Hestia stuff is unidentified now Unidentified javelin.

[Speaker 6]
No, no, no Paris stuff is unidentified Yeah, I would go through your guys's stuff just to it seems like anyone who got unleveled has unidentified stuff Cuz rhubarb and Diane their stuff you can hear screaming, okay Nothing Images seem to have died in my inventory.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah Spells are imageless I've renamed my the fister Okay, oh Yeah, a lot of the images disappeared well, I love a Anyway, so are you bringing anyone over extra are we keeping it to the core group? Well, I plan on bringing over Sakura and rock the dog if James lets me So I can play as both corpus and Sakura in the same session.

[Speaker 6]
I think that might be a little interesting I Think that was the big issue when there were huge groups is like you had two different initiatives You weren't paying attention. Not you you like the royal you just people in general. We're having an issue with multiple characters Yeah, usually that's what I notice is it's like oh, it's my turn again.

[Speaker 5]
My ADHD fucks with me a lot, but I Know I don't like blaming External factors like that.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah Acknowledge them and then fix them Or keep them in mind at least so you can help prevent yourself from doing it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I Find that when I have a lot to micromanage I fix I am more, you know focused when I have more to do So having more characters might actually be a benefit for me Yes, these are my doctor prescribed extra characters Yeah, my doctor prescribed extra extra activities extra attack actions Oh gross, dude Are you just told on me I Will I will give you a moment to clean up there. Oh good Right, so James did you hear what I was saying I'm assuming not because you were gone No Okay, I was saying that I wanted to bring both secure and rock along While also playing corpus so like having an additional player character to micromanage I would I would stick to one for this first combat. I would choose one.

Okay, and then afterwards Secure will get transport and then okay No, you get you get trance.

[Speaker 1]
Do you choose whichever one you want just Start off with start off with one and the reason I say that is so that you can be Well, you could get acclimated for this first one Acclimated.

[Speaker 5]
All right. I think I will I don't know if it's gonna be ranged combat or not. I will I'll stick with corpus.

Also James is the astral sea liquid.

[Speaker 1]
Can you lock on it a Monk would be able to run on it. I believe you have to like I believe you have to run across it And then if you're not on like a solid surface by the end you end up you'd like begin sinking Yeah, it says only during the move you can stay on it There were a lot of things earlier when I was looking at the Like the items tab.

[Speaker 6]
There were a lot of items in there that got imported

[Speaker 2]
really

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it looks like people were uploading stuff to the items tab and then putting it into their sheet rather than just Into their sheet because there are a lot of things and that probably isn't helping any

[Speaker 1]
We're in the we're in the items tab

[Speaker 6]
Um, I was just seeing them like loose at the bottom of everything

[Speaker 1]
There we go, I've got both of them. Are you importing a fire?

[Speaker 6]
Wow, there's a box you don't even know There's plenty of water around Well, I guess there's not as many items as I thought But there's things like life domain cleric human human copy I elf I elf another high elf Mobile high elves Bunch of Z's.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to delete those whale ships because they're probably misbehaving I'm also deleting Decimus Are you gonna decimate him? I'm gonna do a lot worse than that. He's not getting away with ten percent.

[Speaker 5]
That was the most satisfying the most satisfying Session man Mm-hmm Hey GM, can I say this very weird thing?

[Speaker 6]
That's very antisocial I think maybe that's why the hey DM thing felt so weird like It just felt like he was trying to piss you off I don't know.

[Speaker 7]
I think he was just oblivious to how annoying he is.

[Speaker 1]
I Think I just reminded him of his dad Thought of his dad while he was talking to me and just that natural hatred just started to come out That's my biggins.

[Speaker 7]
Oh boy. Whatever's in the corner here has big meaty claws

[Speaker 1]
It does That's what you guys are going to be encountering today, so The doll whale is gonna pull up to another portal here and you can see beyond the portal Two things I would one you can see the world of Rackus off in the distance It looks pretty small from this from this angle here because you are on one of the moons of Rackus

[Speaker 4]
Oh freaky

[Speaker 1]
We're specifically on Ellen Isle, which is the shattered and cracked blue moon Rackus, it's the one that looks like sort of like a giant ice ball People like more what's its name? Hello Nile E L O the Nile as in the It's in the river river.

[Speaker 3]
All right, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks Everybody would like more information on if they could do a Pana or history check that would probably be fine or something else related to the occult Okey-dokey Pulls everybody aside and says alright So we need to sink this beacon this buoy into one of the holes of all the craters that you're gonna find over there The problem is something lives inside here. Now if you can get it out of the hole Will be that'll be fine once the buoy goes in this thing is not going to be able to mess with it But the buoy needs to go in the hole. Whatever reason needs to go in the same hole as as this critter lives in We gotta get that boy in the hole It's all boy time I Did the arcana check it was a 23 23 23 I will Nile has a long history of being associated with the occult particularly Particularly nightmares such as Elysius, which is the was it Elysius?

No, I think it was It's you mind Well, I was going to say do you mind like pasting that name I don't know how to spell that No, I could do that later Thanks Just remind me later Associated yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, but Elysius is one of the nightmares Who's kind of looks like a giant starfish or she's often depicted as a large starfish of five-pointed star and it's been Contorted and the rest of the year With usually with the rest of her arms filling up or composing like a ritual circle is Frequently referred to as the eye of Ellen Isle and find that there's an entity called Ellen Isle That's that this moon is the actual eye of That's not hasn't been cooperated anywhere else. But like cults keep calling it the eye of Ellen Isle throughout history pretty consistently There's been a few spells based on it and they're almost always A vehicle So it's not really designed for combat not really designed for or even the preservation of life just spells designed to start fucking with people's heads and cause a bunch of problems in Society if that makes sense like social contagion type spells Thank you Richard you guys are encountering here is a astral dreadnought

[Speaker 5]
Sounds powerful

[Speaker 1]
I didn't put on young rusty. It's been a while for me as well. I didn't put on the initiative tracker.

[Speaker 7]
So that is everybody else There's a bit of this directly, okay Folks go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative And I guess my wyvern goes on my turn instead of its own that's correct I Guess my power goes out.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry Alright now I got his magic code.

[Speaker 7]
Oh No Well, that's fun magic. So we'll be fine.

[Speaker 3]
I Like how casual you just drop that like oh, yeah, by the way all you spell casters Get fucked don't worry.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like this This might be the first time I have ever used Tyrona's plus-one rapier in session They even had that all right, I am ready to begin here My dog is very quiet In Paris you were up first. This guy is inside of his home.

[Speaker 7]
No, stop it And he's not pointing the cone at us, right He's inside of his hole.

[Speaker 1]
So he's just kind of like staring Also, we can see him You're aware of him you can see like a little bit of claw and such sticking out of like just barely bulging out of the crater Do we have many spell spell casters here Mimosa is not one I'm gonna use a fourth level. Hold on And I can see it Yeah, if you're trying to cast a spell on it, I will allow you to see it I hope this works If I give us Assistance and advantage No, not for not for this thing making a save I don't think it has magic resistance familiar enough.

[Speaker 7]
It just says regular Oh Shit, cuz that was an enchantment Okay, so good on wisdom save I'll curse its wisdom at some point 24 hits. Oh Okay Giant finger. All right, and that's curious.

Actually, hold on.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna go back a little bit Which is one tile All right, that brings us to mimosa Nessie I Am muted I was Are you indeed you guys wanted to hear my children scream all the time though, that's I don't mind I think it's entertaining It is quite a hard to hear things though, um, I guess I will just use my bonus action to dash To get up to it So use this guy Just 31 hit 31 does I'd appreciate it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's not a great But it does say I'd be terrified if a 31 missed And unfortunately, that's my turn I can't I can't back away Both times, okay Yeah Yeah, well, I figured it. No, I got a 31 and a 29.

[Speaker 1]
I just assumed a 29 hit know that the damage Is 30 both times which is funny this thing roars out black razor is very excited He's like give me a soul. Give me a soul. Give me a soul.

Give me a soul.

[Speaker 2]
Give me a soul in there Hush little patient.

[Speaker 5]
You'll get it Be fed corpus It's this 55 why is it not telling me it's it's it's yeah It wasn't telling me for some reason that kind of annoyed me See if I remember how to do this properly target with T.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm Why just double right click?

[Speaker 4]
I thought you said target with teeth for a second Right click oh my god Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

[Speaker 5]
All right, I'm gonna use three charges on this staff 24 hits 24 does here All right Well, the monsters have the new sheet now And I'm and I'm going to use an additional three charges on this attack. That's only half three charges Yeah as ten charges, but you can't use three per attack Up to three. I mean Wow about fucking blows That's pretty rough Yeah, I Can use a stunning strike for this?

I think bonus action, I guess flurry of blues Use this first and I would like that crit to be a stunning strike. So I'm gonna spend Make me a con save unless you're immune to stone Yeah, damn it, all right, that's my turn do your turn he's gonna use

[Speaker 1]
All three legendary actions for psychic projection Need everybody within 60 feet and I counter spell that No It's a feature

[Speaker 5]
You don't love me

[Speaker 1]
I'm doing it from the edge of his if you're within 60 feet of anywhere within the edge of his token there you are in this 60 feet

[Speaker 4]
Okay How far is he from the ship

[Speaker 1]
You guys aren't on the ship right now.

[Speaker 3]
Oh You are in Who does that Oh Who does that catch the I think catches pretty much everybody.

[Speaker 6]
I Think you're safe.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Wait, hang on Your Anything from the token For instance Paris definitely in Paris is definitely in Irona is out everybody further than Kairona. Wait, is that 55 feet? Is that is that what that says?

Say in turn every to the right of Kairona is safe It's 15 psychic damage and now for his actual turn What about the people that? Saved and they take half people who save take out Harrison para you take half of Half of the team and then Mimosa you take So take the 15 so at the start of his turn It's not weapon attack At the start of his turn he turns the anti-magic cone up black racers like get a soul get a certain Oh, he's quiet We just need to get like a sheath that's an anti-magic sheath for him.

[Speaker 7]
So he shuts the fuck up.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Yes, absolutely It's my intuit this clause except it doesn't have its bite attack on here. Okay, that's fine I'm just gonna make three two I'm just gonna make a three full attacks two versus Corpus and one versus me Moosa Actually, no two versus Mimosa Corpus a 16 day is crazy hits 18 damage. Oh Seven that hit Mimosa I Want to damage and then 18 to hit Mimosa miss I rolled a two I'm gonna uncanny dodge that 21 That you can uncanny dodge that is His turn wait, I think it Ian let's go Cuz I don't have the bite But it's not on here Hey All right, who is next Hera?

It has to make a con save What Yes, it's blinded I'm going to bone goes away No Well, he still takes half damage at least Bonus action So if you use a wand to cast a spell does that count as casting a spell for the only one spell per turn?

[Speaker 6]
Oh wait. No, it should automatically have done it because it says the level scaling Um Maybe not.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe that's not how this is 5d8. So I think it assumed one die per level Yeah, I'll have to fix that I had to refresh So enemies abound has to make a spitting throw it does That hits He's not happy I'm gonna go back one and have this Astral Devourer Yeah, that now brings us to Mimosa Yep All right.

[Speaker 2]
I made I made a deck They're piling on it, so i'm guessing we're gonna have to make more You will in fact have to make more.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah most likely Basically, that's Awesome. Oh, no, that is accurate. All right 33 damage.

Jesus Then it is your turn Have any of them died Do I take any of that damage? Uh, well, you're a You may it's a deck save so you could use evasion You don't take any damage when you succeed on a Okay, I wasn't sure if it was if it allows for half damage you take no damage instead

[Speaker 2]
Okay, got it

[Speaker 1]
It is immune to stun

[Speaker 5]
God damn it All right, well i've reused my bonus action to uh patient defense dodge and i'll heal while y'all are doing your thing

[Speaker 1]
So i'm just going to move over this way and it's also going to use hungry and serpents Grass serpent spray I said no longer go back to the bottom So probably a setting I disabled all right mimosa and corpus and you do both to make me fix 37 throws All right, you will take half

[Speaker 2]
Corpus takes half at 22

[Speaker 1]
Unless corpus do you have evasion? Uh, I do have evasion.

[Speaker 5]
I do have evasion actually Oh, well, you would have taken half from the other ones and you would take no damage from the ones that you succeed Oh, I didn't even think about that because I see these were features and um I thought it was only on spells. So I take no damage from that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, well And then i'll This will attack uh mimosa while he does that Miss miss Easy enough And then we have last one which is also going to go afternoon, so We're gonna hit oh Yeah i'm damage Uncanny dodge, okay For six damage You know uncanny dodge the 11 And All right, it brings us to para Oh, yeah, your thing is still up What thing your spiritual weapon No, it isn't.

[Speaker 6]
I failed the concept.

[Speaker 1]
It's not concentration If I get hit No, it's not concentration Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
I didn't realize that I'll put him back then you can hit that thing. I will at least target one.

[Speaker 1]
Um These guys are like, oh, that's awesome. These guys are like the real threat All the way up to get nothing again It'll be 3d8 and your spell attack, but I mean if you just roll d20 you'll probably Like a plus 11 or something All right, you spoke too soon I didn't speak too soon And for your action, yeah Uh my action i'm gonna cast John Why are you doing this to me?

[Speaker 3]
I'll put it here Oh, that's a lot of dice I'm going to be barbs the one that just succeeded that saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Excellent. All right That's what happens in the world.

[Speaker 5]
He fails Aren't they all fair? That's a lot of damage

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah, nice

[Speaker 4]
If you guys are just all of these things before it's my turn again I want a level one spell slot refunded Because all i've cast is hunter's mark

[Speaker 1]
Now I've heard you're free to move in such but it is now kind of Mr. Yes

[Speaker 4]
Um, i'm gonna uh bonus action move the hunter's mark to anybody who's out there um I should have checked this before

[Speaker 1]
pardon corpus

[Speaker 5]
Appreciate you

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, let's double check.

[Speaker 1]
What do you got for us?

[Speaker 4]
I'm just gonna go with the good old elvish blast Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Geez, which one are you targeting?

[Speaker 4]
Um, just uh the one that's between corpus and And press t on it. No, sorry 32 definitely gets There you go um With the second bolt target another one You have made a roll.

[Speaker 1]
What's what are all the extra dice?

[Speaker 4]
Um, so I get the church, uh dreadful strikes is a 1d4 psychic Hunter's mark is a 1d6 I don't know what the Oh, okay, so the other The I think it added the other ones twice Yeah So that's 10 blasts It's only 21 All right, 21.

[Speaker 1]
Uh That's still really good for um elvish blast do you have all right and for the remainder of your beams Do I need to roll attack again? Mm-hmm. Is your what are you level 11 now?

Yep, all right, so you have a total of three beams. Oh, whoa exciting That one looks accurate damage whoops There we go, and i'll target a different one with each of those Okay All right, and that brings us to dr.

[Speaker 3]
Basia Oh sweet, um question can can Um hirelings upcast or is it are they stuck to their one the level of the thing? Yeah, right that makes sense, okay well, um Trying not to toast people then we are going to cast There we go and that should get The those folks without toasting a mimosa and company it's fine if you hit corpus It will also not hit corpus even

[Speaker 1]
um They do have innovation Oh fuck yeah, finally some good news

[Speaker 2]
Holy shit, that's impressive Damn

[Speaker 3]
It's okay, I still have wither and bloom how injured who's the most injured person over there Looks like it's mimosa. Um, how many hit die would it take for you to get back up?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, man, um, i'm at 77 out of 125 Oh, so you have what's your hit thing?

[Speaker 1]
Wait, wait, hey, no, let's go I'm, sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Okay. I'll uh I'll just cast then wither and bloom at fourth level.

I need the fireball damage Oh, ah, it's not putting down the thing that's fun. Okay. I'll just manually Put down the measurement control There we go, so that should catch all the creatures and uh, let me roll the damage Um Okay, so I need to roll a dex safe or safe for a fireball no, no I was rolling the damage I don't have the damage roll for fireball.

So oh, oh dear. I hadn't realized I hadn't rolled that. Sorry Okay, so that's the damage that the creatures take for wither and bloom but um You can you can uh add let's see extra hit die Second you can add two x you can roll three hits die to regain your health awesome Would that just effectively be a short rest?

I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yes Oh plus my spell casting modifier so that it will be your three dice plus um What's my spell casting modifier plus six to each so 12 18 plus an extra 18 Okay Cool. Thank you So that will be 17 plus 18 that's 35 in total Yeah Oops daisy Right and that will be my turn Oh, wait, there's one that succeeded. Um That one can get barbed as well I've already applied the damage Okay, it's all good then i'll let me remove that spell slot Okay, all right.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, i'm just gonna force you guys to make another deck save for a serpent spray Get this boy's health back. Oh wait, I did Rest is not back yet.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, no need to roll damage brings us to caris Um, am I muted I don't think I am nope, I can hear you. Okay, cool I will come here and cast i'm casting spells like I have spell slots. Um Let's see, uh You know what fuck it My god, there's so many little layers of circles and stuff Let me remove mine since it was a burst there we go Can someone remove the other circles just so it's easier Another one is a dawn that one needs to be up All right, just slightly reduce the opacity It doesn't matter really I got um I got most of them.

I got one two, three, four five Yeah, the only one i'm not getting is the one that's in between mimosa and corpus So hopefully they're a little little bit stupid All right, um, and then the one that failed i'm just gonna shoot which one failed i'll tell you it's this guy at the top Aha, okay, that was an illusion spell range

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, not patented so they're illusion or enchantment Okay

[Speaker 7]
27 damage

[Speaker 1]
That's the new one for incapacitated since they insist on changing the symbols every single fucking update

[Speaker 3]
Oh, by the way, uh paris since it's a charm spell if the one that succeeded you could also oh it's dead never mind No, I was going to say you could use your um What's it your minstrel dice, right?

[Speaker 1]
But I could also just shoot it You could yes, that is true If you're immune to charm then individually apply these Okay, I think for your priorities your bonus action anything else in your turn Uh, nope, that's well actually I could probably move but i'm not going to so brings us to mimosa Yep Okay, all of these cancel Are those unconscious?

[Speaker 2]
They're incapacitated if they are attacked they will be Are we oh, okay So we're not killing them right now My dawn's still up Oh They're gonna take damage on their turn. So Okay, so i'll just attack this guy. That's not in the little Let's get him Uh And I will put that thing that kills him i'll put the sneak attack damage on this one that isn't incapacitated Who's also dead Okay um So, can I just hit one of these guys Does it matter?

[Speaker 1]
Sure Now both the ones to the left of you are pretty pretty not great Okay Is it still alive?

[Speaker 2]
Okay Then I will hit that one with my bonus.

[Speaker 1]
No longer puts the death mark above the critter itself. I do not know why Also dead Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Oh i'm hasted I totally forgot. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Um this point you guys Let's be here at this point i'll just give you guys the win because these guys are incapacitated They can't do shit Three cheers You know it takes damage at the start of the uh dawn which would actually uh parrot do you want to roll the dawn damage again? Yeah It's gonna be Each one hit away from dead That would be it for them All right, this is a bunch of little hastral devourers and the astral dreadnought are both crispy They're all crispy.

[Speaker 4]
I want to I want to harvest those big claws Yeah And possibly have a devourer of oil

[Speaker 2]
Do you need help harvesting

[Speaker 4]
Um, sure you can throw me advantage, okay

[Speaker 1]
Could I take its eye if you provided you succeed then

[Speaker 2]
Okey-dokey, I could also try getting this eye out if you thank you Is that going to be survival or sleight of hand

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I think that this one whoever goes for it is going to have to do less than one rescue Session one.

[Speaker 4]
What are you mumbling about my good boy?

[Speaker 1]
So right now i'm just doing right now i'm just doing xp and collecting that up you guys can I think for this would have to be arcana Oh You got I can do that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Nope Hmm I'm going to add dice to that.

[Speaker 3]
That was embarrassingly low. Um, I can give you advantage to Okay Yes, please That's better no need for dice All right 22 22 Be a rather difficult task here.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so you would collect Yeah, so you Oh, never mind, you could go ahead and mark down an astral dreadnought's eye Who I've just realized i've got more than one critter's eye in here.

[Speaker 4]
That's neat Are you just collecting eyes apparently Apparently The art is happening we all have like weird collections.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I've got the craziest stuff The stories we can tell with the things in our stuff The things in our bed indeed I still have a giant glowing sunflower seed Hmm Plant that I should plant it right outside my oh my gosh I can yeah Okay, so the you have a what sorry a giant glowing sunflower seed Oh awesome.

[Speaker 4]
It's seven thousand three hundred thirty three xp Oh Awesome I am 700 short of leveling up Wait, how is that the xp we got just now?

[Speaker 1]
Per person or already split that's per person Okay, how much was it again a person is already split So There we go You got it.

[Speaker 3]
7333 What a nice number That's in where in the chat Oh, sweet I think that might it was the final pronouncement of one of the broodlings before it's come It just mutters a weird number and we're like all right then Hmm I love a lot I wonder what that means anyways What what what do you mean what what happened?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was talking about that The numbers Very happy about this Oh decisions Oh, what level are you now?

[Speaker 7]
Um level 13, however, I am multi-classed so I have choices.

[Speaker 3]
Oh awesome Awesome i've just gotten my eighth level slot This is great Are you what are you multi? Are you going to add another class to yourself? What are you?

[Speaker 7]
Uh, no, i'm a bard and a rogue but I think I think level three rogue is good enough or um, like I have my Uh, and that's good enough with flavor and everything Yeah, just I might just control you along with bard Nice nice What do you um, you get bonuses at 11, yeah I don't think I get much at 11 I think level 10 and 12.

[Speaker 3]
I do get an extra I get a d10 bardic inspiration at level 10 and an expertise magical expertise Magical secrets, I don't know what that means, but that's cool Oh magical secrets means you can get two spells from any, uh classes spell list Okay Okay Yeah, so at all you can so um, I can I can give you a list of good ones or you can just choose yourself so Do whatever your heart desires? You're which means actually when you uh, wait, no I don't know if you can trade out magical secrets, but there are a lot of spells that will be great for you I understand these if you can but yeah, so you can take out like That's the 10th level bard feature that you're getting now, right Yeah, but if I pick rogue I think I can like get a ability score upgrade This is up to you.

[Speaker 1]
It's like you could either choose a fifth level spell from any uh from any spell caster or grab like a feat or an ability score increase which Which are are valid?

[Speaker 7]
I think I'm gonna go with um I think you know what? I think I will do level four rogue for the ability upgrade because I could definitely increase my dex That's fair

[Speaker 1]
Oh, your dex is uneven was that supposed to mean it is it's uneven

[Speaker 7]
Is crooked it's a 17 And it's about to be a 19 think this through

[Speaker 4]
So while lucky people who aren't 100 xp away from leveling up get to level up um Kyrona is gonna experiment with the dreadnought claws and see if they are edible when cooked

[Speaker 1]
edible

[Speaker 4]
Yes, they're giant crab claws, of course, I don't know if that means

[Speaker 6]
They're edible

[Speaker 2]
Anything is edible at least once oh wait until um, i'd be monkeying and then he can eat

[Speaker 4]
All right, then kyrona is Rating the galley

[Speaker 2]
And then we can beam him out if we want.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god. I just realized I was muted this whole time. Oh my god How long have I been muted is all you on on discord so you can know No, I was being on discord.

I just forgot I didn't bother checking So did I read that correctly seven thousand three hundred thirty three xp.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Okay I think also takes corpus above Uh, no, I am about 2.3k xp off.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you already applied it. Okay Okay, i'm changing that to my status anything is edible at least once hop on a dinghy and sit next to the portal He's not actually going to come through because he's very wary of Stepping foot on this moon He's like, all right Good job. Go ahead and drop that drop the buoy and I wasn't actually expecting you guys to kill this thing You underestimate us Hey mark, do you know if it's edible?

It's I would not touch that thing with a ten foot pole Yeah, but you won't touch the moon either so I mean I'm, definitely not going to take a bite out of the moon. Not this one

[Speaker 4]
No, i'm just saying that somebody's clearly not made out of cheese Somebody who's scared of the moon is not somebody who's Word on what is scary i'm going to take that's just any moon

[Speaker 2]
Hmm That's no moon

[Speaker 3]
Hey question, do we know what this moon's made of is it just like regular i'm really nice

[Speaker 1]
Okay, more or less a large comet

[Speaker 3]
Okay, i'll probably take like a rock a frozen rock from it or something if it One that doesn't look too melty I suppose Sure So Yippee, i'm also amassing quite a good rock collection.

[Speaker 6]
This is great But also would make it easier to get back to I don't know if you could just teleport back here.

[Speaker 3]
I think you have to plane ship If we're in the same plane as it if we're in the same plane as it it'll make life easier if it if we're not Then it would have to be a plane ship.

[Speaker 1]
So if you're so if you're on braccus, you can teleport to them sweet I'll pick the first That was the first teleportation experiment cool Who was the um first person to set foot on the moon? Squadron, nobody knows everybody dies Oh Oh my god.

[Speaker 7]
Wow It wasn't this moon was it?

[Speaker 1]
He knows everybody It was just a scroll for the rotation left We're gonna find one of the skeletons It went back to It went back to um what was it when they got to the lab that was just Again, all the papers were scattered. Everything was torn up and shredded. The only surviving record was the teleportation scroll and Quote one small step for Myself one giant leap for my bank account.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay Okay I see So while this is happening, do we have the opportunity to take a short rest Are you guys taking a short rest?

[Speaker 1]
The captain at this point wants you guys to hop off back on the boat

[Speaker 4]
You don't have to be alarmed by that 1d 100

[Speaker 1]
To be alarmed by every single roll I made

[Speaker 4]
Got it, this is true

[Speaker 1]
The captain will at this point inform everyone that there is a storm coming but they could use it as a tailwind potentially Reach ashram hub in the equivalent of one day But there will be an additional encounter so we are going to take a short 15 minute break while I Stack up the rest of the encounters for the day

[Speaker 5]
All right

[Speaker 2]
You did fine.

[Speaker 1]
You did fine I'll just show him my what he's been trying to go through my webcam the entire time and not like me Not the virtual camera, okay I'll be back in about 15 minutes. Okay. I got you later nonsense to engage in

[Speaker 2]
I shall be back as well

[Speaker 5]
That was not a bad combat encounter that was fun, yeah, yeah, I didn't get to stun anything but I feel like um I feel like it's good that I can't just crutch on stunning strike for like every encounter Because that would be really lame Because I can there you go I can guarantee that pretty much anyone fails a stunning strike save Because of my really nice. Yeah, I can reduce their constitution save So they oh, that's cool yeah, so my stuns are guaranteed and Going against enemies that can't be stunned is like the only counterplay or people that have a way to automatically succeed a save And it makes for much more interesting combat encounters because it means I can't just be a one-trick pony and just punch punch and punch And everyone is stunned

[Speaker 3]
Well, there we go

[Speaker 5]
It's also enjoyable for me because it means I actually take damage and can do my healing abilities

[Speaker 3]
Noise

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, 7.3k xp, I didn't think we'd actually kill that fucking thing

[Speaker 3]
The wind is a win

[Speaker 5]
I was partially saved by the fact that the um main critter lost its bite attack Otherwise, it probably would have swallowed me

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, that would have been unpleasant That is like also

[Speaker 4]
I mean that is fun for the rest of us

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, see there's the difference And I mean it is the smartest play, you know, because you can't kill me really quickly um I'm still a bit of a threat So the best way to deal with me is to just crowd control me and put me in a position where i'm not a threat Because trying to burst me down isn't really possible.

I'll just Teal back up on my turn So it's it is the smartest, uh The smartest play

[Speaker 3]
Hmm I've gone and after the fight i've gone and decided to check what else it was immune to And it's immune to so many things to charm exhaustion frighten so that um So charm monster wouldn't have worked um to paralyze to petrified poisoned prone and steamed And if it eats you, um You can't leave unless you have plane shift Or wish Actually, let me rephrase you so we wouldn't be able to save you unless we had wish And you wouldn't be able to leave unless you had plane shift

[Speaker 6]
And in order to leave with plane shift, you'd have to have a fork

[Speaker 3]
What oh, yeah, you need a fork or an item that allows you to go without a fork so uh, you would be very stuck because none of us have wish unless Unless para wanted to use her divine intervention and um, you don't have plane shift.

So if it ate you, uh Yeah, you would just be gone Right, but I think it uh Unless it died in which case you'd be fine.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say Yeah, if it dies, you just pop right back out It's small as me. Y'all are like, all right, we're ready.

[Speaker 3]
Let's go bring out the knives Hmm Uh, but you would have been able to investigate its past meals. That's a cool thing Yeah, demi-plane Can only leave to planar travel It resembles a cave and past meals. So if it ate anything cool, I guess you'd have been able to Investigate that.

Oh, we should cut it open and see what's inside The thing is its stomach is a Plane of existence. It's like a different plane. That's why you need planar shift or and stuff to get there.

[Speaker 4]
Um Yeah, well I have um, I have planar binding no I have I have gate seal Um, uh, what would that do?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I guess you could also leave with gate Mm-hmm You fortify there.

[Speaker 4]
I put it in chat. You fortify the fabric of the planes so that portals close and can't be open So I don't know if that would allow us to Climb inside safely It does seem to be sealing it up so it might just double block us yeah Still it would be cool But because when it dies everything pops out I imagine it's demi-plane also vanishes So did anything pop out of it I I don't think so. Let's see been hungry Yeah Yeah, everything inside appears around the corpse.

Otherwise, yeah, so Probably starving then it had digested everything For a second I was trying to remember if the broodlings had appeared before or after it died Oh Shit, I just dropped my head.

[Speaker 2]
It was right before they it died. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah So it wasn't like so it didn't eat its kids Okay Um, I have to go get a magnet so I can find the sewing needle. I just dropped on the floor

[Speaker 3]
Okay Good luck I'm going to Disappear for a moment probably get water

[Speaker 5]
Disappear into outer space

[Speaker 8]
You're welcome

[Speaker 3]
You did make a rainbow

[Speaker 8]
You

[Speaker 4]
Well, I didn't find it but it may have fallen between One of the little gaps in the wooden floorboard And it's a sewing needle not a pin so i'm not very concerned yeah

[Speaker 8]
I miss anything Yeah L yep Y Yep Congrats on finding your needle.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I didn't Oh That's a different needle Okay, no it it'll turn up somewhere all right A needle Yeah, I dropped one of my sewing needles on the floor. Oh, that looks so good That's awesome By the way, I don't know if you guys have heard me quietly going out every once in a while that's me stabbing myself with me E Stop stabbing yourself. It's not oh I sewed myself into something Several times.

Oh, oh, I can't even There's a um an artist who has um Done that intentionally to make art She like sews designs into that Top super thin layer of your skin where it doesn't hurt No, it's gorgeous I bet it is. Can you tell me the artist?

[Speaker 2]
I just can't.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, i'll have to look it up.

[Speaker 2]
Give me a second Okay, um Like how do you and even eyeballs are my one? I get it.

[Speaker 3]
I get it. I can't stand any sort of eye nonsense either. But yeah Um, let's see, have you thought about investing in a thimble?

[Speaker 2]
I find them very difficult to use actually. Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough.

There's some newer type Replacement for a thimble there should be I guess i'd be band-aid Maybe there's like a sewer's glove or something.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know There you go, I put the link in a spoiler in overflow, um, and that way the images won't come up Okay, i've seen it a very good design.

[Speaker 3]
It looks terribly painful though.

[Speaker 4]
Um, No, because it it the first couple layers of skin it doesn't hurt at all Especially if your hands are calloused Yeah, that that makes sense uh That makes sense Oh, wow, great fantastic work Terribly painful.

[Speaker 3]
I I can okay. I know you said it wasn't painful, but I Am imagining it. Yes.

Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
That's that's the term Even if it is painful, that's really cool. I believe the term is Yes, yeah The term's what squick Yes Although I feel like she could have used a different color.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, hey someone joined when did that happen? I didn't recognize a voice and I was like, who the hell is that? Howdy I lurk Hello All right What is wild jammer Um, I think it's a setting book for dnd yeah, it's um for the astral plane and I don't know how much functionality it actually gives the system itself Yep, has she used the flash cards at all?

[Speaker 2]
Um, hang on say that again, honey n Yep. Okay Um, no because I don't want them out when the twins are awake see ah Yeah That's fair h I technically don't even want the puzzle out while the twins are awake, but it's just zach and he's Busy not napping. So how old are the twins?

They will be two in october. So Yeah, the And they are no longer in a crib which sucks but you know Sucks because they have to like learn how to actually adapt themselves and they don't want to Oh, correct So you got to play with the money though, which she really liked but I also The moment the twins got up I put it away Yeah, it should be a little bit more five seconds rosemary was out she did put it in her mouth

[Speaker 6]
Ah, that's true I always forget that she eats everything

[Speaker 2]
I know Anything I felt so bad The last time We were all in here She was Very gently like grabbing my pants with her teeth. No, she put a sticker She put a sticker on my leg and was pulling it off with her teeth But then she bit me and I got startled and my hand went out and I felt so bad. I had to give her cuddles Can we not play that game anymore Yeah, she's gonna grab things with my teeth phase which is very scary hi Yeah, all right now i'm going We missed you hello a bit Are you chilling out there bud?

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. Why don't you come this way? Let's come over here All right, you're gonna lay on the mouse instead that's fine Gate seal, where the fuck does that come from?

We were discussing whether or not we could get into the devourer stuff Oh, okay, I guess you would be able to because as I recall everything that it ate kind of like, uh detonates in a radius Not literally detonates, of course, but So what came out of it Tyrona go ahead and roll me a d20 Okay, one second Oh, oh, yeah, it's supposed to be a d100 percentile as they say Same result. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh I mean, what are the chances?

[Speaker 1]
All right, i'm gonna have conrad you go ahead and roll me Five d we're sorry. No, no. Yeah, go ahead and roll me 5d 20s drilling 5d 20s I did Oh, yeah, james, you said, uh, I could teleport secure and uh I thought you said I could do it beforehand, but now you can That was a good time setting perfect Give me an air.

[Speaker 2]
It's been a minute Bar, do you want me to teleport monk in so he can eat the lobster meat?

[Speaker 4]
Yes Okay, um, and i'm gonna bring meryl because um Kyrona and meryl share good. Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
Monk and corpus hanging out would be the funniest shit He is also immune to poison and disease, which is the reason I Oh, that's a good idea Yeah, I doubt monk even wears shoes so that's definitely a good idea he does not wear shoes no We would totally Dumpster dive to just walk by and be like, oh shit. That looks yummy Oh dear my god It is so so lucky.

[Speaker 3]
He's immune to poison. Would he still do that? Even if he wasn't?

[Speaker 2]
Yes Yeah, I thought so I still have a resistance Probably He probably eats a lot better now since christopher pinius is there unintentionally so but still Not by much not by much, but he does Does a little less He eats a little bit healthier now that he has someone to go like don't eat that Who's the person stopping him from um eating garbage half the time Christopher pinius the rando he hired.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, oh, yeah that guy who has ascended I Love the story arc of this Which is hilarious because he's not a player character, but christopher pinius has had a very interesting arc across the course He has he's an honorary pc Yeah, i'm so so happy with this Because i'm alarmed What's up I'm not going to roll any more dice for you because i'm alarmed. That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
So you guys have so far I suppose If I bring monk that means pinius needs to come right?

[Speaker 6]
Yes They are a set.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I keep forgetting to do down times on his um animals that he has Oh happens just one last result Since there's no time dilation I could bring other characters but also B i'm wondering if it'll be one too. It's getting a little full I think yeah Yeah, so I think I think i'll be good.

[Speaker 1]
I think I have 16 player characters in the same combat.

[Speaker 2]
That's not And and hey more xp so I know I need yeah, I don't mind if we Boop monk and pinius back after he gets sick off of the lobster claw Is he here just for the lobster anybody who gets booped in does not get to return until the ship has returned Oh, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
He can he doesn't have to be in combat or anything if we can babysit the dragon That's probably not a good idea Do you think the dragon would be appreciate well I mean probably would it know that people have given it stuff or would it just be like, oh cool horde?

[Speaker 4]
I mean i'll tell it Okay, whether or not that matters to it.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know Would it look like Would it like a clockwork amulet? Does it have good vibes I mean, yeah, it's basically a guaranteed 10 on any it's a good vibe. It's a good vibe.

Cool Okay, I shall I shall gift it later, um, but yeah I also have a circlet of blasting that I don't use I should probably give that to someone Like a fucking sword.

[Speaker 1]
There we go.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, we're good Oh Speaking of magic items. Um while we're just before we start anything Did you guys take all the things you wanted from the dragons thing? Uh, the list is still up and I think the month is almost over.

So I am going to put it in the free for all found items after the session All right um, I will Outline some specific stuff for merrill Since i'm okay using her loot to hatch the dragon Okay, so it should be in session reports I put a big old list so you just pick from the days you use that character um Thanks for the reminder short rest You're welcome.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah short rest We did I mean, I don't think we have yet. Yeah, I wanted to it was a suggestion

[Speaker 3]
Hmm i'll put the link in i'll put the link in a voice overflow to the item thing in the bobs walkie-talkie copy message link Wait

[Speaker 7]
um, it's using my For spells it's using my arcane trickster spell casting thing, but I want to use my bard spell casting thing It won't let me switch Let me try a spell real quick Yeah, see he's using my um arcane trickster and that's not fair How do I fix that?

um When you're in you're using the new sheet i'm guessing Yeah, I keep saying uh, can I have properties of undefined reading types?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, i'm doing that when I try and change the sheet type. That's interesting.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Same here Uh I think under yeah under details on the spell there's a source class and you can select a different class type Unless that's not what you mean No, so up at the very top.

[Speaker 7]
Um on the the sheet that i'm using there's Two different things I can use bard spell casting and it has a little circle that I can tick and then there's arcane trickster spell casting abilities and So with if I use bard I can have a plus five ability if I use arcane trickster I have a plus two so Yeah, I think that happened when I leveled up so I don't really know I don't know because it's happening to para

[Speaker 6]
For when i'm doing some stuff Is dnd just cursed right now

[Speaker 3]
I think so

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, it seems like it's doing that anytime you try and change anything on a sheet, um

[Speaker 1]
That's weird All right, so I did post the magic items collected in the chat 18 potions 12 scrolls a plus three unidentified shield and a plus three unidentified sword As well as the first randomly dropped holding

[Speaker 2]
Holding oh

[Speaker 1]
Oh bag of holding nice

[Speaker 2]
18 potions 12 scrolls damn

[Speaker 1]
Additionally the remains of a most of the stuff in his, you know, don john his stomach has been thoroughly pulverized over the millennia, but there is the the most recent haul That's been somewhat preserved at the very least was a is a now destroyed ship Primarily made out of a purple crystalline material with some wood paneling and plating of the sides and red of these have since been Petrified more or less they look mothy What was that last thing, uh, wait, sorry repeat that

[Speaker 4]
Sorry

[Speaker 1]
I said that they look sorry It's the last Basically the only intact structure or it's not even intact it's it's broken itself, but it's recognizable The other junk is a ship That's been that's primarily made out of a purplish crystalline material It's also covered in or was covered in a lot of wood plating and it had rubies attached to it Which have since been petrified and moth

[Speaker 2]
A whole ship

[Speaker 1]
Yes It wasn't large it was like the size it's a skiff more or less it's not even a sloop

[Speaker 4]
We should tow it behind us to our next destination Well as in completely unseaworthy it's definitely unseaworthy

[Speaker 3]
Have you typed out all the rest of the items somewhere in the chat Oh, i'm blind, okay

[Speaker 7]
Um, my character is a little messed up at the moment

[Speaker 6]
There it is Yeah, some of my spells are doubling up for some reason.

[Speaker 7]
I I can't so it's it has it ticked on to um, Arcane trickster spell casting and I need it to be on bard spell casting or I am a level four rogue Hmm And it won't let me it keeps giving me the cannot read properties of undefined in parentheses reading types Oh, you're getting the error too.

[Speaker 3]
I thought i'd broken something it When is it appearing when you're trying to add a feature or also when you make items and stuff or everything?

[Speaker 7]
Um, so I can't change the sheet type

[Speaker 6]
And I can also not change my spell casting ability, uh, it looks like it is the error of dnd beyond existing Because I just looked it up and that is what i'm finding is it is a glitch with the dnd beyond importer

[Speaker 1]
let me just Or let me just uh disable dnd beyond importer because honestly, we're not even using that much right now and it's kind of Dead

[Speaker 7]
Kind of

[Speaker 1]
he's It's caused a lot of problems it needs to be updated but like right now I just want to table it

[Speaker 6]
If that helps us i'll reload once you do so it'll automatically reload us, okay, we don't get a choice in the matter

[Speaker 8]
Okay You want little mister are you trying to get one of those little cheese cups?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Do you want this cheese cup? Yeah, you want the cheese cups.

That's exactly what you wanted the cheese cup I got these little things that are called like temptations spoonables And it's like a little it's a little spoonful of like cat food in it and it's cheese and chicken flavored I got them so that I could give augie his medicine, but he doesn't like cheese and he doesn't like chickens.

[Speaker 4]
So Uh-oh, I will give them to dex Um So the egg the red dragon eggs cord is now worth 3250 um, and when we are not in combat Or basically not off the ship Um Corona is gonna leave oberon's free to basically babysit it and talk to the egg. Okay Did not work Still doing it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you gave it the chalice set and the puzzle blocks.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I didn't work at all That's cool if I I had assumed that nobody claimed anything specific And so it was just Yeah, yeah, you can take it's all good that are equal to your gold or you can take your gold Oh wait, hang on a plus three unidentified shield Yeah, you took the puzzle box I took potions.

[Speaker 2]
There's all kinds of random loot uh Um I want it, but I don't have a character here that could have it so you can have it. None of my characters can use Yeah, I Like I want to look at it for knots, but he's not in here.

[Speaker 3]
So Don't matter whatever the potions and scrolls are I will be most interested in those especially They're more spells because that'd be great Can um mark cool Identify things for us or what? Oh, i'm saving my spells for no no Does anyone need the sword or slash want the sword?

[Speaker 5]
Um, well, they're unidentified.

[Speaker 4]
Um Oh, I see.

[Speaker 5]
So it might be cursed. It might be cursed. So, uh Go ahead.

Try it out and find out I I'm not picking up that sword bro. I'm gonna pick up that sword. I'm gonna start Being coming crazy.

All right, i'll take the shield simply because i'm a gritty fuck but the sword might be a little too much I think i'm happy with my staff of striking though I realized i've never ever picked up the identify spell. I don't know how last Such a goaded spell though I know I know but there are other cool spells Could I try and identify the shield with an arcana checker or something like that?

[Speaker 4]
Can't you also identify? Can't you also identify things just by sitting with them for an hour?

[Speaker 6]
That's attuning to them.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Yeah All right.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I think does identify them. It's just then you're attuned to it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I will pick up the shield because I can actually use the shield Nice Uh, does anyone want the bag of holding I don't Need one I've already got one.

[Speaker 4]
So I don't need it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah same.

[Speaker 1]
So i'm good And then Monk can take it although it'll be christopher pinneas is I definitely think everybody's about to be disconnected Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you Hmm okay. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um, so Monk is coming over.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
All right. So there right now.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he doesn't have to If we don't want him to but he is on the ship Nice Uh, so he'll probably so he uh, christopher finneas will be holding on to it for him. Yeah or Yeah, he's excellent Nice.

[Speaker 4]
All right Uh, so now does anyone need slash want a sword and We just need to figure out what the potions and scrolls are so Well, I I think we can't really determine who needs the the the Sword until we know what it is That's true, right?

[Speaker 8]
It could be cursed. I keep forgetting that I mean, maybe it's curses that it's cursed and you keep forgetting that it's cursed Yes, that might be it just it's just uh It's a weird recursion loop sort of curse Can you imagine if that was a curse of an item you forget it's cursed.

[Speaker 2]
That's the Honestly, that's a great one I think there's an item like that really I want to say there's one where you can't get rid of it or there's a few But like if you try it just winds up back in your inventory I know in one of my favorite card games there's A play on tribbles where if you draw it and discard it just goes to the top of the pile for the next person That's hilarious.

[Speaker 3]
I love that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah

[Speaker 6]
Some curses that people made are very silly there's one here where it's uh This curse causes you to either stub your toe or bite your tongue or cheek once a day and just as it heals You bite it again Yeah, that's horrible

[Speaker 7]
That's so rude minor inconveniences Are the worst

[Speaker 3]
That's just an actual curse some people have incredible

[Speaker 6]
curse the curse of language You have to roll on a random table to see what language that sentence is in

[Speaker 2]
Oh

[Speaker 6]
Where are you finding this curse list I literally just looked on um silly curses for dnd 5e On google and i'm just looking at pages Um, there's a lot of random rpg net forum Uh, like I said, I was just looking on Google itself.

Um, one of them was on dnd beyond um Which is where the uh language curse came from neat I was trying to find like actual cursed items Oh 5e tools is probably my best bet for that 5e tools Give me cursed items.

[Speaker 1]
Oh curse my current workaround is I need to right I need to uh, I need to just say I need to import from the compendium Then I can drag the token out and then I need to disable and then re-enable and that lets me that lets me have everything That's pretty convoluted yeah, i'm gonna submit a bug report to the people who do wild jammer because they do a lot of great work

[Speaker 3]
So Oh, I mean There's the here's a suitable one.

There is the bag of devouring. That's the thing And the armor of arrow attraction, which is hilarious

[Speaker 5]
Oh if I equip the shield, I think I lose some of my abilities

[Speaker 3]
Uh

[Speaker 5]
But I mean it's okay to lose some of these features for plus 5 ac I think What would I lose

[Speaker 3]
The The armor of our attraction gives you a negative 15 to any ranged weapon attack And apparently you don't find out until the first time you get fired upon in earnest

[Speaker 5]
Nice, I I don't gain martial arts. Okay I don't gain martial arts.

[Speaker 1]
I can't use unarmed unarmored movement Right now i'm just waiting on you guys to uh, if you if you finished uh, Distributing loot and stuff like that.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what you're doing Oh, we were wondering if mark could He said no, yes, he did say no. Oh, I see

[Speaker 4]
Actually, I think what he said was he could but he won't Because he's a nervous

[Speaker 3]
Do we know what the spells and potions are or that that can be a later thing but

[Speaker 1]
You would like to identify them later you're free to do so

[Speaker 3]
Awesome Um, all right, I guess we can then just uh put them somewhere till we find someone who can identify this stuff for us

[Speaker 4]
um If you is at least Willing to give that shield to meryl then I will craft um some kind of staff for a corpus

[Speaker 5]
I already have a Go to that staff though, okay

[Speaker 4]
um robes

[Speaker 5]
Do I have robes I don't have robes.

[Speaker 2]
What are you looking for?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's a great question. Um Mind if we talk about it after the session? Sure.

[Speaker 4]
All right Basically trading the shield for future crafting services.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I see Oh All right, we all good Yeah All right, I think we're ready for james Excellent So when you guys get in trap My first thing oh social conflict app is not available All you guys are traveling along the astral tides away from your initial destination You guys see a This back here and Diminish its size somewhat You guys see a two ships. Well one ship and one very large figure off in the distance It's kind of flying a little bit above the tides They both look relatively insectoid in nature and the The captain calls mark cool and the collection of people who are willing to Serve as a boarding party or a defensive party to the front of the helm Okay

[Speaker 8]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
So we're on our last stretch to the hub here these Pretty sure I could see a mind spider Yogi had been plaguing this trade route for a little while and it's been mostly loops Smaller skiffs smaller attack vessels, but this one looks quite a bit larger and I don't know if you could see the if you look at the telescope here, you could see a a large insect off in the distance the one wielding a sword that's That's another trick of the eyes that is nearly as big as the ship They're called what is it called spirit warriors in this part of the other realms, they're Creatures that people can that fighters can bond with and pirate

[Speaker 4]
Oh, does it look friendly It doesn't look friendly. It has a giant sword.

[Speaker 1]
Of course, it doesn't look friendly The issue is that if it's with a mind spider vessel then it's probably in the ob Can we steer clear of it?

[Speaker 7]
Just go around it.

[Speaker 1]
That's the trouble our paths are going to converge here and I want to say about three leagues and Our options to get the osram hub are to either outrun this thing Or we can perhaps through the we can pass back through the storm and slingshot to osram hub Could we use the storm to our advantage? Well, there's there's A defined advantage Uh use the what kind of storm is it? It's an astral storm it's going to Batter us and potentially fling us out of the planes They tend to have a bunch of nasty creatures inside, but i'm a decent pilot So if we don't get flung somewhere else I can slingshot us to osram hub But it's not a guarantee

[Speaker 4]
I'm not afraid of confronting them for what it's worth

[Speaker 1]
All right

[Speaker 4]
We've been Yeah, severely underestimated before

[Speaker 1]
It's not i'm not seeking a confrontation. I don't doubt that you guys can Kill whatever's on board. It's a matter of like the crew that I have here and more importantly the cargo This is what pretty much all of our lives pensions insurance policies depend on So if it's if some of us like if I die The cargo still gets their safe that my family gets That gets a portion of the rewards They keep getting that portion over and over again so that we don't have to worry about it.

But like these are not to be trifled with and that's That's my worry Okay, then how can we help you out right now? I was kind of hoping that you guys had something actually I Don't know Do you have anything to like make the ship go faster? It's not it's not a fast ship.

This is a this cargo vessel All right, I mean, uh I can summon an air elemental I'm, sorry, you could summon one an air elemental I don't know if that would like push us along Would air elementals help I don't think in this case Darn We're getting pushed along by the helm Maybe I could use my expertise in piloting to try and not What every time you mention that?

[Speaker 3]
You get sprayed with water via piston addition What exactly is that?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I know it isn't what you call it, but the mecca

[Speaker 1]
The spirit warrior It's a yeah to my knowledge they're lifeless insects have been animated by magic

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so not a celestial elemental play or being

[Speaker 1]
No, I think it's a undead creation

[Speaker 5]
I look like fucking spiders if you ask me

[Speaker 7]
Abomination

[Speaker 1]
We're getting closer at this point And so while we're talking could somebody See if you could get eyes on that mind spider if you see anything else

[Speaker 7]
I'll fly up as far as I can.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, well actually how fast are we going because I can only move this fast You don't want to get left behind Yeah, the thing is you can't actually fly up that far or dive that Everything is kept sort of level on the astral tides Okay I'm gonna tie a little string around you Uh, it looks like we're gonna be fighting this thing.

[Speaker 7]
Is it too late to go into the storm?

[Speaker 4]
No, it's not too late If I got close and hit it with dispel magic would it fall apart No These things are huge Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I think we should go into the storm.

[Speaker 1]
Let's try to slingshot And who was on the telescope No, I can Unless para wants to because that's gonna be perception right probably perception see a reception Yeah, here's a perception Now Nice get a glimpse of the folks on board. It is not neogi there are Demons aboard the mind spider Oh, it's demons at this point. You notice that the spirit warrior is not just wielding any sword.

[Speaker 4]
It has a The sword is crackling lightning and hidden almost sort of hidden behind the Spirit of warriors back in its other hand is a whip made of fire All right, let's go Compels me to kill demons That it was okay to run So kairona is immediately turning it to arguing Um for full speed at the mind spider and destroying them Will destroy us Sorry, darling.

[Speaker 2]
You're outnumbered with this and we'll talk to the unicorn about it We'll come back when we have bigger better ships let's just We just outrun him this time around Yeah, we don't have anything to help without running though is the problem.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Hmm all my things target creatures and this is a ship so we can run and manage And you can target the creatures on the ship That is true But we're trying to outpace them It's better how do you that's you have anything to accomplish this Okay, uh I'm gonna let you guys think and then vote on it while I fill up my coffee.

[Speaker 3]
How heavy do you reckon that ship? Oh, no, it's probably more than a thousand pounds.

[Speaker 1]
Never mind Yeah, i'll think Storm increases I don't think we can really Four functional guns on it right now Like I said if we get really lucky and we're all rolling nat 20s we could probably do this But this feels like an evade Situation.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, let's uh Oh we could try to uh What's the word for boarding parley?

[Speaker 6]
Parley is like trying to be like hey By the way, and that's not going to work if one of us has to actively try and kill them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, parley is Negotiated.

[Speaker 5]
I also think they would take us captive Or okay, they are not gonna listen to so What if we try to seize control of the vessel? you for my gathered it's um Reanimated but it's like a construct of so there's two vessels to be yeah If there was one I would say go for it, but there's two and they're both very powerful I mean, I guess we don't really know how powerful But it doesn't seem like the guys here want to really try and get into conflict. They want to run Yeah, because this guy that probably doesn't want families to get back to Right.

[Speaker 4]
He's a human He's not a suicidal sociopath like me correct In character, um carona and merrill are both arguing for fighting Um out of character.

[Speaker 5]
I don't care what happens as long as it's interesting in character Corpus is a bit of a thrill seeker. He wants to Take the shot or lose the chance I could try to divine an event but um, that would be it for the week It might be worth it I mean, okay Let's think about what we have to gain versus what we have to lose. We have to we have a lot to lose Uh our lives their lives the ship Yeah, we have a lot to lose Uh potentially, uh things we could gain apparently that Because james put heavy emphasis on the sword of one of the demons.

So perhaps a very powerful legendary weapon Uh, we could gain if we managed to uh do this along with a fire whip whatever cargo Whatever cargo you got to understand that sword's as big as the ship.

[Speaker 6]
None of us can wield it but our combined might If it's attunement it usually shrinks down to Yeah Okay So if I was going to do a divine intervention to help Which it's not a guarantee yet yet. Um What exactly would we need from that divine intervention do we want to guarantee that they can get through and like Like they're protected from the demonic energies or whatever or do we want to instant destroy them

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, all the demons to size small

[Speaker 5]
Okay, my question is what does divine intervention do exactly anything I fucking want wait, literally

[Speaker 6]
But apparently I keep being like, okay, what are the limits and james is like, oh Yeah, what do you want from me?

[Speaker 3]
So you could just ask him to smite all the demons maybe

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so if you smite the demons can mimosa get one of these ships

[Speaker 4]
So what oh the ships

[Speaker 5]
So it can only do one thing I can see that's one thing Um, yeah one one ask, um, okay, maybe I think a safe ask would be that um they're all like stunned for a Certain amount of time like maybe an hour five minutes might be more reasonable so we can get in range board and This ship can Move around on standby

[Speaker 3]
You could you know what you can ask james if you can just kill them all or just stun them

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because like the chance is going to be the same no matter what i'm doing.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
These are demons fuck them Yeah God hate demon And I do potentially have a nail That will put their corpses like toss their corpses up just as long as we don't you know I also have um Divination spells so I could divine whether or not it's a good idea to do which one um Yeah, I got divination spells james is gonna throw a fit I don't know james always likes it when I use divination spells. I feel like you have time to do the spells Is it an action or uh divination itself is one action. I ask a single question concerning a specific goal event or activity Um dm offers a truthful reply maybe a short phrase cryptic rhyme or an omen um I also have wheeler woe I think Okay, so I think a safe question to ask them for divination would be what are our chances?

[Speaker 5]
of whatever the purpose with of these two ships is Destroying them or yada yada Where is wheeler woe?

[Speaker 6]
Wheeler quote, where are you? Oh, yeah, is it a good idea to kill these guys?

[Speaker 5]
Um, let's see What are our chances of success uh The spells are chances of success.

[Speaker 2]
It's a second level spell and it's augury Okay heart what are you saying Oh, uh, the wheel of woe spell augury.

[Speaker 3]
It's second level. It's called augury. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
All right. Nessie What were you saying?

[Speaker 2]
if you like I don't think we have to ask like what are our chances because if you're just gonna Have them all die.

[Speaker 6]
Our chances are like here's the problem though if we fail I think we're locked in on the choice I don't think I can divine intervention and then we run if that doesn't work. I think if we go divine intervention We're fighting them regardless That's my concern Uh, that's why I kind of want to know objection Nothing ventured nothing gained Isn't there anything that's away from here?

[Speaker 2]
I I could probably just divine intervention this past Intervention because i'm also thinking about their future which probably isn't necessary A safe passage that they can't see for ships Oh, yeah Already isn't there a divine communication thing?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, I think that's divination So you could ask if we fight them what are our chances yeah, that's what we're trying to decide what what we want to do um Because I have wheeler I have augury which lets me ask a question um I have augury which gives me wheel or woe whether or not it's like good or bad. Um That takes one minute though, so I don't think that would be as doable as say divination where I ask a question Um, so yeah, I guess I could do divination ask a question. What are our chances?

Of taking these down ourselves and then immediately be like, okay. Well, I don't want to fight them. Hey god, do you do it?

[Speaker 1]
Me All right people What do we okay?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, I think we are going to Do divination i'm going to cast a divination spell and ask god Uh, hey, are do we have a pretty good chance of taking these guys down?

[Speaker 1]
ourselves Depending cast of the nation. So I Yeah There we go. The unicorn staff hates demons all hates demons and devils and is powerless against them You'll be compelled to kill all such creatures when you encounter them.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, you don't get punished if you don't know.

[Speaker 4]
I mean you guys could definitely Tie kairona into a hammock Until we get through it's not that kairona will be punished.

[Speaker 5]
It's that kairona has no choice Yeah, yes, which is why she's arguing for fighting It's murder time bitches Look, we've been underestimated before and ask the question.

[Speaker 1]
Nobody said anything about underestimating All right, go ahead and ask the question again I've read the spell You have a good chance of defeating them With as much or as yes with as much or as little collateral damage as you can stomach

[Speaker 7]
So did god just give us the go ahead

[Speaker 3]
God said yes, but they might be collateral

[Speaker 6]
As you can stomach as well

[Speaker 7]
I want to go I want to I want to leave this area

[Speaker 4]
Um about the ship that was in the devourer's stomach um It did it get left behind or did it get loaded?

[Speaker 1]
You just could have loaded that onto the cargo, you know, the pieces of it could have loaded that onto the cargo ship

[Speaker 4]
um, could we um Get into that and shove off and just look like we've been abandoned um, so that the enemy will come to us instead of to

[Speaker 1]
the ship well, it's not seaworthy, but the the doll whale does have like I guess escape pods are the closest thing dinghies Boats you could totally do that in it. It has um, that plan will work.

[Speaker 6]
You just can't use the Ship that doesn't work, right the ship that doesn't float Okay, but there are other there are other ships to use that way So we lead a distraction party and then Um, I guess the plan is we try and save the ship itself And use that to get back to our other group Yeah, we're gonna take them over I'm good with that if that is what everyone else wants to do.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Why the hell not?

[Speaker 3]
I'm super nervous about that plan, but okay So are we we all doing that?

[Speaker 2]
We'll have para do a divine Intervention or whatever just briefly.

[Speaker 1]
When is the next time y'all can play?

[Speaker 6]
I don't know I would be able to play God what would the earliest be probably next thursday, unfortunately for me I don't know because i'm going.

[Speaker 3]
Um, i'm i'm going on break and I have to go with my family so I Give me maybe like not I don't know When are you doing that? Uh, like on saturday, so it's going to be a week of of a strong so so and then The week after that likely probably which of us can play tomorrow I can't I can't Okay tomorrow. It depends

[Speaker 2]
On the time I can if it's the evening, okay Yeah

[Speaker 6]
um because i've got I've got my client in the morning and then i've got augie's appointment in the afternoon And then I was gonna have a game but uh, half my players are unable to be there full-time so um Me did not Um, I will grab a hammer time real quick

[Speaker 2]
There we go

[Speaker 6]
Of when I will likely be home Because I can say it'll be probably about 2 30, but that doesn't mean anything to you guys because you're not in my time zone You

[Speaker 3]
Where did you oh there it is. Oh Yeah, I kind of knew that was gonna happen to you Yeah Uh Okay If I manage to speed run all my work and I may be joined for a couple hours. I will be able to What time is it for you that is at 10 30 p.m. Oh, that's doable It's doable. It's doable. But then I have to like leave at 8 in the morning, but yeah, it's doable Do you need to be awake to leave?

[Speaker 2]
Are you driving?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, that's fair.

[Speaker 1]
I can just sleep on the train, but yeah Bully and carton to joining the game Yes, exactly I know Yeah, so basically I'm going to get the packs together for the miyogi mine spider And what should do its own it because this one is Is larger than a typical mine spider?

[Speaker 7]
I think it fucked

[Speaker 1]
Ship's gonna be split in half when you guys are boarding then it's gonna be gonna be fun

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, and then one other important question how many guys can I kill at once with a divine intervention

[Speaker 1]
What's the what's the bg3 Is you can also use it to replicate a spell There's sunder the heretical for 80 10 radiant damage to all enemies in a 50 foot radius Right to me I don't know if that would kill a lot of them probably a lot of the small guys

[Speaker 6]
That'll certainly take a lot of their health down.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
No, that's How do I is that a save or they just take it? Wisdom save okay How do I roll back merrill's lover level because I never did that Um, if you have the old sheet you can just like Change it with a drop down Um, I can't take a look at the new sheet so I can oh I can on the new New sheet works When you are editing editing your sheet and there's a little Arrow next to the level you are and it'll say okay. Yeah It's another drop down.

Yeah, just to make sure because with my granny wizard the spells Didn't downcast Okay, well they still stayed it's just you didn't have any slots to use them which Is what happened with hestia and um teakwood? but i'm just gonna leave them because it's like I i'm gonna eventually level up with them maybe and like have them again. So Yeah And if you don't have a spell slot to cast it with you can't use it anyway, so it's not like yep Gonna do anything And some of your stuff might become unidentified Yeah, which is weird what a weird effect Uh, so do we want to make that session for tomorrow?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, let's do that session for tomorrow Yeah Okie pokie Okie dokie.

[Speaker 6]
Catch you guys later.

[Speaker 1]
Um, if you would like I can do like we can do like a couple rounds of combat with the The baylor as I assume you guys have now surmised inside of the Spirit yes His mech is faster than the mind spider he is absolutely gonna rush out

[Speaker 2]
Can we Do some more strategic, I don't know get people to safety or something you can have like a you have like a minute to like

[Speaker 1]
strategize, you know

[Speaker 5]
Let's smack him and smack him hard

[Speaker 1]
Like a minute to like a spell or strategize or something like that you could totally do that as ever okay

[Speaker 3]
Okay, um, I can give people invisibility did we have a short rest on the ship as we were going Like between the moon and where we are now You did remember, okay, cool, that's good All right, so I can give us Yeah, no worries I can give some people invisibility if they need the advantage and stuff for hitting people so like to like roll

[Speaker 2]
I'd like to like fly onto the are we Yeah, we it was said a while ago I just forgot and didn't realize oh, okay Yeah, I didn't know you were doing that.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
No, I'll Short rest then technically You can use your uh song of rest, yeah Oh, yeah all right I'm ready to kick ass Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Um, I if I I'll totally take some Invisibility so that we can um So that I can fly

[Speaker 1]
Are we boarding their ship did I hear that correctly first what's happening is the baylor is approaching

[Speaker 2]
So we're getting into like position to fight

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna do like if you guys would like if you guys have time I would love to cap off with like a round of combat versus the baylor

[Speaker 2]
Okay Okay We don't have to like pretend we're on a ship and it's getting boarded.

We can just like Attack it Okay, so caris you wanted invisibility Okey-dokey Here you go I'm gonna I'm gonna cast I'm gonna cast my cloud of daggers.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know. Um Just take a note i'm giving the um concentration to the intern i'm going to rage I guess right there be angry I'm also gonna put it a little bit above my head so I can just walk through it Yeah, so smaller people can hide under it Does uh, does anyone else want um invisibility I'm waiting for james.

[Speaker 6]
I heard him say wait, so i'm waiting Ah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm waiting for my things a little bit again.

[Speaker 2]
So you guys have one minute to prepare and I want to do to Have yourselves three initiative All right One two three god damn Twinsies Also the first creature that I hit has People have disadvantage or no people have advantage to hit it For the first round.

[Speaker 3]
Oh nice.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, that's awesome I always start with him getting close Oh, he's not actually a token What do you mean?

[Speaker 2]
Can't target him Oh Do you guys want me to add monk since he's here?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, he's here. I forgot zekir is also here I mean it is a token.

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to lag the map.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I can target the player tokens, but I can't uh, Target him I can't do it with double right click and I can't do it with t Um Is there like a separate It was because they were so big and the target was so small and Yeah, but if I target someone else it's not replacing the targeting the way it does for everything else.

[Speaker 1]
That's not the thing that's happening um That's okay, I mean it's only one thing on the board I will know who you guys are targeting Glitter wyvern to the board.

[Speaker 7]
Is that okay? Is he tamed and stuff? I think I got him trained Every time I see your wolf, I think it's a like a panther The image doesn't read as a wolf until you get really close to it Yeah, he's got like he's kind of like milk that yeah the head's like nothing and everything no, I get it Um zekir is starting us off Yep Uh, is this thing like enchantable Can I can I fuck with it?

[Speaker 1]
I think that the guy inside probably has Full cover against spells targeting him directly Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Um, well in that case, I guess I will just uh, that doesn't mean that you can't use any enchantment spells but No, all of mine are kind of a little bit personal or crowd-based um I can all right i'm gonna shoot i'm gonna have a couple of things I can do. Uh first i'm gonna shoot Um Do you have advantage if you're invisible? Okay, we'll take the 27th Um, and then i'll also break my invisibility No, I used greater invisibility Okay, wonderful um All right, so damage 34 damage and then I have Orion here I can use both of my little dudes, right?

I can use orion and the glitter wyvern because the glitter wyvern has like an attack of his own He's not in melee just yet He will be at the end of his next turn or at the end of his next turn well I have um I have like a breath weapon thing I think oh, no, it's a wing thing so he can fly Can he fly to it? Oh, no, he can't.

[Speaker 1]
Okay He could he could fly towards him. It's just like it's a very large creature Let me put it in perspective he's moving at about 3 000 feet per Um, all right, well i'm gonna I'm gonna do glitter hide.

[Speaker 7]
So everything every attack against my wyvern will be at disadvantage um I'll have orion Shoot as well. So how do I I guess I can just use what's in his inventory? He just gets to hit Um, what do I roll For him, do I just add to the damage that I did like an extra d whatever what do I add?

[Speaker 1]
Flash What does he have in his inventory?

[Speaker 7]
He's a What is better? He has a gun, right?

[Speaker 1]
He's smooth boar musket and he also has a heavy rifle Yeah, which one's better?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, he has the heavy rifle, um equipped. So we'll do that

[Speaker 1]
Smooth boar musket deals more damage, but you have to spend a while reloading it

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, uh, we'll do that one first then

[Speaker 1]
That's gotta hit he doesn't have to attack He just does the damage

[Speaker 7]
Here we go All right, and that's my go, uh, actually, uh who goes next corpus, um, you get a uh With um body conspiracy

[Speaker 5]
I'll take it

[Speaker 7]
Just oh absolutely Okay Can't wait to die by getting hit with a fucking whip

[Speaker 5]
Oh, we're all one vehicle in that baylor no famous last words here

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna die horribly. I'm not his famous last words are gonna be like oops.

[Speaker 1]
All right end your turn Because these are smaller they don't look like they deal as much damage To be met correctly, but the fact that their magic does certainly help It's first and foremost. It's a vehicle. We're trying to target it with something.

We'll determine that when you Answer all right.

[Speaker 5]
All right corpus, uh question how far away is this ship?

[Speaker 1]
We can say it's We can say it's like 200 feet away Yeah, I can't jump to it right I guess we can say 100 feet away so that people were still Like shooting it All right.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, one last question. Do I have view of uh view of the baylor? No, he is inside of the spirit warrior Uh, well i'm bout to lose her age I should not have done that That's how you said we should know it's a baylor Oh I could pilot the lifeboat.

All right, I will do that. And what are my options with it? Like could I try and get closer to the vessel?

Could I ram into the vessel? If you ram into it I will banish you I'll banish you irl All right, let's take a look here so what I want to do is Ram into it then climb up the side of the vessel using my monk's unarmored movement.

[Speaker 2]
Are you ramming into it with your body? No at the vessel Yeah The lifeboat's fine the actual ship is not okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so I rolled a 17 Oh, can only do that.

[Speaker 1]
Wait. No, no it is

[Speaker 5]
That is

[Speaker 1]
All right 17 does work

[Speaker 5]
all right I want to start walking up on it and find a place to sort of Hold on to if I can't get fully up

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and make me a just a grapple check

[Speaker 5]
That would be Is that strength or athletics grapple check

[Speaker 1]
That's a part Yes, okay

[Speaker 2]
Phineas is going to cast blade ward on himself um and then he'll give um some inspiration

[Speaker 7]
He'll give monk inspiration I guess his character token he looks so dramatic I know

[Speaker 2]
um And that's his turn um Are we waiting for them to get close to us?

[Speaker 5]
Well, we've just rammed into them. So Okay, oh and by the way james I used my bardic inspiration on that athletics check.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, were we allowed to pass spells before we did all of this? Yeah, but like before Well, yeah, like before combat happened. Yeah, I cast late.

I left out of daggers Out of daggers have done anything if we moved away from that space That's a problem Yeah, because I don't think you can move it after it's Or you can cast a new one Yeah, i'll just cast a new one. That's a bummer. Oh well Um I'm gonna i'm just gonna Oh, do we want the big guy?

[Speaker 6]
He's inside I don't I think he's just a representation Okay, so we're not in this ship yet there's no one to actually attack It's not a ship so much as like a mecha suit Does that make sense?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's fine. Um, i'll just put the cloud of daggers there then And then I guess we're just attacking the mecha ship It's like an iron man suit A pig Okay, so should I hold my turn until there's flesh that I can cut at? I mean, you could probably stab the ship thing All right, I guess I will Stab the ship thing black razor's full I guess Yes, let's see.

What's this the 25 hit? 25 does hit I'm gonna say it does not get sneak attack Yeah, I was looking I have sudden strike which gives me sneak attack on my bonus action But I think sneak attack rules still apply.

[Speaker 1]
So that's all I was looking at I mean just by a corpus is on it, but like you're attacking a vehicle. I don't think that sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Oh I was hoping I could use the sneak attack and then use the second one on the person inside of it Ah That's okay i'll just i'll just Start killing the metal.

[Speaker 4]
All right, there's my turn All right You cannot yes full cover, okay, uh, but then in that case meryl is just gonna jump on there Laura you sound really quiet Sorry, I moved my microphone away from my face a little bit. Do we get advantage?

[Speaker 2]
You would have advantage on the next attack, I believe It's the first round On the thing mimosa attacked. So yes If you're attacking the mecca thing, you're gonna get advantage until my next turn Do either of those hit?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, good and I will throw in a Might I think i'll go Searing so go ahead and make that comm save

[Speaker 1]
it is I could try to see start burning vehicles start burning We'll say yes for the moment

[Speaker 4]
It's gotta have some kind of fuel maybe Yeah, or or it could be that the metal starts melting

[Speaker 1]
Oh, see because the the baylor on the interior is quite the baylor the interior is quite hot already Well, he's about to get hotter yeah, I could say he's like only immune from the from the bonded flames or whatever that's fine And anything else for your turn?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no, that is it for meryl Monk and then kairana then para then sakura Okay Um Uh Um I guess There's a 15 hit it does Seven is there a certain order flurry of blows has to be in? Not that I know of okay, that's probably past where I've been thinking about them Okay Um, I think it's one more I think it's one more Um, yes, that'll be his turn Are we all in that five five five square No, that's that's what we're using for.

[Speaker 1]
Uh For cloud of daggers earlier I just roll damage. I know I know which one you're targeting. Okay I will require I will require monk and Focus to make me deck saves for this because they are like directly on the spirit spirit warrior I don't take no damage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh Does he Oh, yes, I assume monk has some form of evasion Monk would also have evasion.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, because he's he's pure.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he does

[Speaker 5]
Can't touch me

[Speaker 4]
Feeling

[Speaker 1]
So, is there anything else for chirona before paris turn

[Speaker 4]
Nope actually and that actually that gets cast at

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it doesn't or you got quite again, but I'm assuming that you're casting on the spirit warrior

[Speaker 4]
Yep I was just sort of muttering to myself about spell slot levels

[Speaker 5]
All righty, is there any benefit to shooting the vessel which is what i'm assuming these attacks are doing

[Speaker 4]
Well, I think we've got to break it open to get at bay All right

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if you're good.

[Speaker 6]
No, I just yeah, right sub beam

[Speaker 1]
All right, the vessel is now cracked open you can now see the baylor as well

[Speaker 5]
All right, it's About to get frosty anything for your bonus action

[Speaker 6]
Or my bonus action Um No, I don't think so

[Speaker 1]
Brings us to sakura

[Speaker 5]
All right, let's do this Bonus actions zephyr strike And i'm going to use a trip attack maneuver i'm just setting this up for my first shot Roll this with advantage Great. Oh my oh shit Wow And then i'm going to use Too hot hot damn make a demon want to retire man.

I'm just doing this for as much damage as possible Does it 20 hit How many rolls are you making? Uh, i'm making three because i'm a gloom stalker for my first round of combat again I'll hold off there Once they're caught up, let me know That was three, right? Yep, but I have The ever so annoying action surge, oh, okay another crit, okay Uh, where is lord and you can't roll the saving throws One of these will probably guarantee no i'm not It's not gonna be disarmed All right 18 misses probably 18 will miss the Okay, and I have one question If I action surge do I still get the extra attack from gloom stalker or is that a one-time thing?

[Speaker 1]
I think that when we went over it with fall and the answer was yes Okay well That's my turn Okay Excellent work. I don't know how i'm supposed to follow that up You're not you're supposed to follow me Oh, yes, of course everybody in the lifeboat Prepare yourselves Just because it's fucking massive Oh, yeah that hits Damage Everybody in the lifeboat who would be hit by 38 Oh is This carousel is 36 damage.

[Speaker 5]
All of you are in the lifeboat What about corpus is on the side of the ship? So does he take any damage?

[Speaker 1]
Okay What about mimosa Can I cunning action dodge you can uncanny dodge to get your The damage That was a third of my health Jesus not dodge.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. I cannot dodge.

[Speaker 1]
I will just you can uncanny dodge right so you could like That's where you use your reaction to take half the uh half the damage Does everyone in the ship also have to do the whip Everybody in the ship will also be suffering the way All of you in that ship make sure you're applying the 56 I don't see.

[Speaker 7]
Um uncanny dodge in my thingy.

[Speaker 1]
So i'm just gonna take a full deck say Oh, wait, I don't know if you have uncanny dodge at that level.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't think I Wouldn't let me take damage I knew dumping as much damage as I could at the start your token selected because I was having that problem No, thank you Ouch Um Resistance is nice.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, i'm going to silvery barbs that no, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no uh Let me expand that spot I'm gonna do is resistance half damage Resistance is half Okay So ready for another Unfortunate, all right, the whip damage is coming now How many whip attacks does it have It just rolled once Okay All right. It's 26 fire damage Half damage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh I am so when I used Down kineas would have been down Yeah, all right for orion. Oh They you need man Blade ward is amazing.

[Speaker 3]
I would highly recommend it I used my reaction. I can't absorb elements.

[Speaker 1]
Ah pity in the meantime Mimosa month and corpus.

[Speaker 5]
Yes I'm going to Oh, no, you don't get out all and die a horrible death

[Speaker 2]
Oh i'm resistance to that

[Speaker 8]
Yay

[Speaker 2]
I'm not because attunement slots are a bitch one of her mini daggers gives her higher resistance

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's awesome

[Speaker 1]
All right, the baylor is going to dislodge from the spirit warrior Which is going to eat him back towards the friendly ship that's been approaching

[Speaker 5]
I scratched him up a bit Thank you

[Speaker 1]
All right, dr boss He will still be within targeting range if you would like to if you'd like to do anything before he reaches his friendly ship

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, how How far is he because I don't know what would you like to do Okay, uh, I was going to try To uh, the forceful plane shift him away because he is a men's to attack.

[Speaker 1]
I So i'm wondering how far he is to see if I can reach him I don't think you can forcefully plane ship people.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Hold on. Let me remove the uh, Yes, you can let me remove the chat description so that you can see the Description description Okay, it just didn't appear sweet It's just popping that thing over and over again one moment Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So if you make a melee attack against it, no, it will not be in melee range Okay, I was I was wondering because if I um, wait, no, it's a bonus action So if I used like 85 feet of movement, I still wouldn't be able to reach it.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so I think that not dang it. I think you would still be able to Strike at it.

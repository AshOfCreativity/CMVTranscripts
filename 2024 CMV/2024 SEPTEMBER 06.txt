[Speaker 8]
My chair cuddled, and this is why. Where's my apples? I hope you guys won't hear her any time she talks, because she's really close to the mic.

[Speaker 3]
For some reason, it's only Rosie that gets picked up.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, she's like, my mic loves her.

[Speaker 9]
This one looks better. What does? Alright, ladies, how's everybody doing?

[Speaker 6]
How are the kids today?

[Speaker 2]
Well, they all have colds, which means they're super duper whiny and clingy, but also I slept like shit.

[Speaker 1]
Because it's, like, unrelated to the kids, or also just the kids?

[Speaker 2]
Unrelated? I slept in a dumb position, and also them have, like, I almost had a migraine today.

[Speaker 6]
Yep. Oh, that sounds about right.

[Speaker 8]
And I'm, like, just congested enough for it to be annoying.

[Speaker 9]
Nobody likes that.

[Speaker 8]
No, it's annoying.

[Speaker 9]
No, fuck sinuses. Yeah. Let's see.

So, I'm going to put this on and...there we go.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to close out my 80 tabs, because I had a work meeting around the same time.

[Speaker 9]
Close that.

[Speaker 8]
I'm not allowed to say I heart you to her. That is offensive to know.

[Speaker 6]
Your freedom of speech is being suppressed.

[Speaker 12]
Bastards. I can't express my love to her. It offends her.

[Speaker 6]
Bullshit, man.

[Speaker 2]
That's how I know that she has a cold, is because she does that. Don't tell me you love me.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, the kid?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yelena got mad when I said I love you to her. She's like, no, thank you.

Don't say that.

[Speaker 10]
I won't tell you I love you.

[Speaker 6]
That's so sad.

[Speaker 2]
That's how I know she's sick, because normally she would have said I love you back and given me hugs and kisses.

[Speaker 1]
And right now she's just not having it.

[Speaker 2]
No. She's really crabby. And her voice is going out, so she sounds super whiny, which is adorable, but I can't say that.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's a good thing I can't teleport that unicorn to her.

[Speaker 2]
I know. And now Rosie is like, I'm tired. Come snuggle me.

And no. I just spent an hour and a half trying to get her to sleep.

[Speaker 3]
But now she's ready.

[Speaker 1]
So why are we up on a stage? I started using it for two reasons. One, so that I could keep track of who was actually supposed to be playing in a given session.

So literally everybody who joins the voice chat is expecting to be let in. And two, so that people who are not in the session, especially when it comes to Lancer, which is a little bit less drop in, drop out, or I'm making it less drop in, drop out, don't just interrupt or be noisy and stuff like that. I booted two people who were being I think some of you actually saw it, because I posted the screen cap in, where did I post it?

Yeah, I posted a screen cap in Town Hall about this one guy who was like came in from one of my patrons, and like the God Emperor of Racism was his username. And so his buddy told him, hey, you're in mixed company, change your username. And he changes it to the God Emperor of R.

[Speaker 10]
Offensive. Why is that offensive? I don't get it.

[Speaker 1]
I understand. I already changed my nickname once. Yeah, why are you making me change it again?

[Speaker 2]
That was funny.

[Speaker 1]
I was like, okay. And then his buddy who was still on the call just goes, oh my god, he shouts the n-word at me and then leaves the server.

[Speaker 3]
Way to show you know how to exist in a world of mixed people.

[Speaker 1]
He's an Irishman. Perfectly invented. He's a half Irishman.

It's just goofy as all hell. So I'm like, alright, actually I'm not dealing with that anymore. If I'm playing in a tabletop game, I don't want to hear a bunch of boops and blah blah blah, and have a bunch of people say what's going on here in the middle of a fucking session?

Just like, alright, people can...

[Speaker 3]
I have never understood that.

[Speaker 2]
If I'm gonna hop in, I'm muted and I'm just chillin'.

[Speaker 3]
If there's a bunch of people in, how do you not assume they're just in a session in a server where that's a thing that happens regularly?

[Speaker 1]
Some people in the server are not necessarily playing in a session. They're personal friends of mine, or online acquaintances, or something like that.

[Speaker 3]
Still, really no reason to I mean, you have in the rules all this stuff for the D&D stuff, too.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess some people just go in. If you don't play D&D and you hop into a session and you just hear a little bit of what's going on, and you've never played it before, it's not really a thing that you do often, I could totally see somebody be like talking about a video game or a novel or something like that, but in a really confusing way that doesn't make any sense. Hey guys, explain to me what's going on.

That's the point that I want to... that's the threshold I don't want anybody to cross. So, during sessions I'm using stages.

I mostly know how to use them properly. Otter, I think you specifically, because you're one of the... I think because you have moderator permissions, you could also add people back and forth when they're speaking, or take them off speaking.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's dangerous.

[Speaker 1]
What's dangerous at this point is not having somebody to do that, because that's been very annoying.

[Speaker 3]
That's fair. I also have three monitors, so I can always monitor it and be like, oh hey, this person's in and needs to be added, so there's that.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. It's mostly about adding people in and making sure that I'm not the only one who can do it or has to do it. And then there's every other situation.

[Speaker 3]
Like that blip of a person we just had.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. The eye, unfortunately banned.

[Speaker 3]
Someone named Radiohead hopped in for like a second and then immediately left.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Well, there you go. That's one of my Lancer players.

[Speaker 5]
I missed the eye. I can't believe you banned him. I'm devastated.

[Speaker 7]
He just did that for a year.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. It was a wonderful year.

[Speaker 1]
Who's... It's an absolute god of Atlas. Total fucking goofball.

You can tell this person, like, hey, come play with us. Come hang out. Not even say no, just disappear.

What are you doing? Get back here.

[Speaker 5]
They were perfect in every way, and you just didn't see it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That is absolutely true.

[Speaker 2]
Someone's a cryptid hater.

[Speaker 1]
Right. So, where did we last leave off? Because I am now confused between games.

Did we leave off with you guys actually finishing up the... What was it?

[Speaker 2]
We took over the ship. We killed everyone and took over the ship. And then that's where we left off.

[Speaker 3]
And you said that we got to the place and taken a long rest, because we all took a long rest.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
That was important.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you guys got to Oseram Hub. This is a veritable planar oasis. So you guys have been, for the majority of your journey, you've just been on basically a river, floating, and you've been, well, having taken over this particular conveyance, you have the mind spider.

You've been floating slightly above that river. It looks like an ocean that stretches really far out, but you get the sense that there are boundaries on this current that you're flowing along. And so you can see out into this expanse, but it just kind of fades into the distinction between this water, that's not really water, that you're floating above.

The distinction between that and the sky, which are just stars, and the sky below, which are again just stars, kind of just fades out after a little while. But not so in this case. Here a bunch of different currents are flowing together.

And it really does look like a proper bay or ocean that's flowing quite literally into this hub. You can see the currents disappear and start, it's like this maelstrom that's below the city that you can now lay eyes upon. Most of the materials here look like, or most of the architecture here looks like it's been crafted from sandstone, mother of pearl, adobe.

The starlight here is mostly like yellow, teal, and a little bit of pink. So you have that kind of like, I don't know, bisexual streamer lighting everywhere.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I came back at the perfect time.

[Speaker 1]
There's a really large channel that's cut directly through the center of the city. And that also sort of functions as its main port. A lot of cargo vessels are flowing through the city.

The typical restriction on height for flying vessels really doesn't apply here. It has a larger ceiling, if you will. A higher flight ceiling.

So a lot of buildings and spires are set up directly along the center of the city for vessels to fly upwards.

[Speaker 4]
I'm eating a snack so I apologize for any food noises.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes I have to slap my mic because my AC just suddenly starts getting picked up.

[Speaker 1]
Of course, I know you guys have not picked up a ton of information about Oseram Hub, but that's fine. This place is primarily an interplanar bazaar. It is filled to the brim with markets.

This is the one step between the frontier of space and the astral tides and between the frontier of space and the astral tides and Bratkis. This is the place that everybody goes to to get to the rest of the local cluster of worlds. If they're looking to trade or really do anything else, navigate in any other way.

And then there is the rest of the world tree. There's the rest of the expanse of space and other worlds out there.

[Speaker 4]
When you said this is the last city on the frontier, my brain went, so this is Astral Plane in St. Louis.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, it really is like that. When you guys do make it to the city you are stopped in question because you're using a Neogi ship and people are a little bit weirded out by that especially because the guards will inform you that the Neogi have been the primary raiders harassing people along the astral tides in this local cluster as well as a few Talmarans or Mind Flayers as some of you know them. Primarily it's been Neogi, so they do stop you and they keep bringing everything to a halt.

As far as currency goes, Electrum is the standard currency within Osram Hub. It has been dictated by the Queen that all public shopkeeps, vendors, and other places of business use it. You can, let's see here, exchange one Electrum piece with metal coins.

You would need Let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
Is it still the same exchange rate?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's a slightly different exchange rate. An Electrum piece is like 0.6 gold pieces, 6 silver, or 60 copper.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm thinking of platinum. Speaking of the ship, did you like my plan for ritual components?

[Speaker 1]
I did, I did. I thought it was neat.

[Speaker 4]
Right, so there's going to be either Kyrona or Merrill guarding that pretty much all the time just to make sure nobody messes with it.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. So you guys are, you've made it to Osram Hub. I believe that you guys were previously talking with the, who am I thinking of?

I'm not able to zoom in on this. There we go. Sorry, I'm going to export this.

So you guys were dealing with a bunch of, I believe you were dealing with the ship captain who said that he was going to get you to the Osram Hub. From there, you guys were basically on your own for getting to Brilliance. Markkul is mostly fine with this, but he does want some like, he likes the fact that you guys have your own ship now because that's going to make this easier, and you have kind of a backup if things go really wrong.

But right now, he's kind of interested in getting he's still interested in getting like a navigator or an additional ship to follow along.

[Speaker 4]
Makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
He wants to make sure that he can take cargo back.

[Speaker 4]
That dinghy, is that ours, or was that the captain's?

[Speaker 1]
That was the captain's.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Well, if it's a market, we could probably find something like that. I think that was the original plan was to get a ship from here.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Whether to hire one out or purchase one out, right?

[Speaker 3]
I suppose if we have the other ship, we could probably do the hiring thing. Again, we have a bunch of hirelings. I always forget that.

[Speaker 1]
You do have a lot of hirelings already.

[Speaker 5]
Who did I bring? Hold on, I think I brought, I don't remember who I brought. I think it was Orion.

[Speaker 1]
You definitely brought Orion.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I couldn't remember. Yeah, no, I brought Orion. What can he do?

What can we do? What are we doing?

[Speaker 3]
I think we're going to try and find Oh, yeah, you can go first.

[Speaker 1]
I was just about to say, Orion is primarily a kind of urban ranger. He's a monster hunter in the style, I don't know, Geralt. Thanks, Steve.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, what are we doing?

[Speaker 3]
I think we're just going to try and glide. Yeah, ship, and then it sounds like a navigator.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
And we're trying to go to...

[Speaker 1]
You're trying to make it to the brilliance of a place called Ion.

[Speaker 3]
Ion. I kept thinking Iori.

[Speaker 6]
Right. False.

[Speaker 11]
Bless you. Why are you so violent?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So we need to start putting in ads, or...

[Speaker 1]
We could probably just browse around. You can. There are shipyards here.

I think that you guys have... If you were to pull up the Astral Tides document, you will find a bunch of prices for different ships. As far as I'm concerned, pretty much all of these will be available.

At this place, like I said, there's going to be at least one of each available for pretty much all purposes.

[Speaker 4]
Irohna's going to go out and look for trouble.

[Speaker 9]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
See if that trouble has a navigator cocky enough to go where we want them to go.

[Speaker 5]
If that doesn't work out, I can have Charis go perform somewhere and see if anybody's impressed enough.

[Speaker 6]
That's not a bad idea.

[Speaker 9]
Let's see.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa will go with Kyrohna's buddy system.

[Speaker 6]
Also a pretty good idea.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and put your... Let's see here. Go ahead and put yourselves in the...

I didn't mean to do that. Go ahead and put, like, what you're doing in the chat, and I'm going to look at it in just a moment here.

[Speaker 6]
I'm pulling up all the ships and stuff like that.

[Speaker 5]
One of these days when I'm updating my XP I'm going to delete it all, and it's going to be devastating.

[Speaker 2]
I always copy it into Discord or something before I mess with it, because I absolutely have. Ugh.

[Speaker 5]
God. Okay. Do you want us to put it in game chat or overflow?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and put it in game chat. During sessions I like it in game chat.

[Speaker 5]
So we just need to find somebody to fly us there, right?

[Speaker 1]
Right. Or you can find a ship that you like and would like to purchase. And probably the best thing to do is to go over some of the ships that you...

If you're intending to hire somebody, it's probably good to go over the ships anyways and take a look at those so that you can... Yeah. It's a good idea to take a look at the ships anyways.

So you can say, hey, I would like to hire somebody with a ship like this.

[Speaker 5]
Can somebody tell me what ship that we should be looking for? I'm scrolling through trying to find the ships.

[Speaker 1]
There's a lot of ships. I think there's ships.

[Speaker 3]
I haven't even gotten to the ships.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, just go to the table of contents. It's conveyances.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you made it a weird noise. Okay. I don't know what a conveyance is.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I know.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't even know we had a list.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's in the Brilliance PDF.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, of course it is.

[Speaker 4]
Outsider flesh.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, look at that. Astral type.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And there are plenty.

[Speaker 2]
I will help you in spirit, but neither of my characters will be available to help you.

[Speaker 9]
What do your characters do?

[Speaker 2]
Both of them are getting into trouble. I don't know. Monk's doing some random shit.

I don't know. I just figured I'd roll on a table. Come to the tavern.

Yeah, I guess he could go to the tavern and see what kind of booze are in space. I think he has some random moon booze.

[Speaker 6]
He does have moon booze.

[Speaker 1]
I don't remember where he got that from.

[Speaker 9]
Mystery moon booze.

[Speaker 1]
Did he get that from the moon?

[Speaker 2]
Maybe.

[Speaker 3]
He either got it from the moon or from the party.

[Speaker 2]
I want to say it was the one where we went through the portal and he kept hearing Christopher Pineas no matter how many realms he went into.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I remember that one. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That sounds crazy.

[Speaker 1]
He got a lot of rewards from the moon.

[Speaker 3]
I know Teakwood has some moon rocks.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I want to say it was from there.

[Speaker 1]
Also, who has the planet out of curiosity?

[Speaker 2]
Me! Mimosa has the planet. It's like in a side pocket in her bag of holding.

Probably rattling around with her nail.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Right now that's probably tingling.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's interesting. She's probably like, oh, something in my bag is acting up. Then she'd do the equivalent of searching for it.

[Speaker 1]
She'd just yank it out. The planet, which previously was active insofar as you could see it had an atmosphere and had rings around it that weren't quite frozen. They weren't spinning or anything like that.

They were just kind of frozen. They were dynamic. They were still in space.

Now the planet itself is rotating and the atmosphere is a little bit more dynamic and is groiling around. The rings themselves of this planet are spinning.

[Speaker 5]
Are there tiny people on that planet?

[Speaker 3]
We've never explored it.

[Speaker 2]
It's always been a side quest that we never Oh, we have to do that next. Probably just be like, oh, Kyrona, it's more active. That's just what she'd do.

She probably would put it back in her bag of holding gently. Just for right now until Kyrona gets back. I'm here.

Sorry. Her world is more active. It is free.

It's spinning on its own. I suppose it makes sense since we are in space and this is a planet or we're almost in space. I suppose I should find someone who knows something about it.

[Speaker 6]
How many people to handle that? That's for you. How heavy city?

[Speaker 1]
First things first, I'm going to start off with Paris browsing the ships and looking for the best ship with firepower and brilliance, traversability. Paris is going to perform at a local tavern to see if anyone is impressed enough to fly her and the crew to brilliance. Monk is strolling around and doing random mischief.

That's appropriate. Mimosa and Kyrona are going and looking for mischief. Paris, while I'm rolling something else would you kindly tell me, would you kindly roll a performance check?

Wish me luck. And then a carousing check along with it.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I have to look at that. I have not done that. Is that just a d12?

[Speaker 1]
It's 2d6.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, it's two ones.

[Speaker 1]
That's pretty funny. I succeeded the check, so it's not like, it's not horrible.

[Speaker 5]
It feels horrible.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it probably should feel horrible. It feels worse than it is. Oh, you gain XP equal to 100 times the settlement's level.

So you get 600 XP.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, okay, nice.

[Speaker 1]
So people are entertained by you, you get into a lot of nonsense.

[Speaker 5]
Do I get money from it?

[Speaker 1]
I think that you have a thing for getting money.

[Speaker 5]
I do.

[Speaker 1]
Meantime, Mimosa and Kyrona The first person you guys come across as you're going through the bazaar is you come across a merchant. It's an arms dealer. They're primarily here selling weapons from The arms dealer looks like basically a giant bee.

Like a really giant bee. Six legs, mostly upright. Kind of like, they're almost oriented like a centaur.

What if a bee was a centaur and still had mostly insectoid features?

[Speaker 11]
Bee-torn.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. They start buzzing and buzzing and buzzing and going through different languages until they land on common. What about this one?

Do you speak this one?

[Speaker 2]
Blank stares from the woman, I guess. I'm sorry, what?

[Speaker 1]
So the answer to that question was yes, but I was wondering if you guys ladies were in need of any kind of protection. I hope you don't mind my saying so, but you're quite clearly new around here.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, we are new, but that doesn't mean we're incapable. What kind of protection were you going to offer?

[Speaker 1]
The best kind for capable people. And he unveils a rack of a recent shipment. He tells you it's a recent shipment.

Like, this is from Nizataman here. You've never heard of it, I imagine, but there's a lot of bug weapons. There'll be, like, restraining people.

There's webcasters. He takes out a staff. Pretty easy if you want your own on-demand silk.

He takes out a piece of, basically a ration, and starts feeding it to the staff. He unscrews a pommel at the end and starts feeding a ration to the staff itself. And you can hear a chewing sound come out from it before a burp 30 seconds later.

He screws it back on and says you just spray silk all over this. He does so with a training dummy.

[Speaker 4]
I'd like to do an insight check on this guy. Just to make sure that he's not, like, scamming tourists or trying to sell something that's illegal or stolen. Go right ahead.

No, Masha. Give me advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. My insight is a plus 7.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yours is a plus 7? You can just do yours.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no. Mine came out pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
As he takes you through the prices, they do seem a little bit higher. Like, he has a glamour over the price tags that makes it easier to change on a whim. And these were, you don't know what the original price was, but these were definitely changed recently.

Like, probably when you started walking out.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I was just going to say that. How much are the prices?

[Speaker 1]
The prices for, like, a patch caster is like 600 GP. Pole caster is like 2,400. Stub caster 2,400.

Sorry. 2,400 again. A wrist caster is 1,200.

And these are all different variants of, like, a patch caster is like, it's pretty silk, but it's based off of a light hammer. The pole caster is like a lance, pretty much. And that's a, that has a longer range.

The stub is like a simple melee weapon. It's like a club. And the wrist caster is basically a wrist-mounted grappling hook.

[Speaker 4]
Well, they're all quite interesting, but I'm afraid these prices are just... We'll go and see if other people have a bit more reasonable price.

[Speaker 1]
This sends them into a phase, like, well, it's not that I can necessarily change these prices for these particular weapons, but what if I, you know, since you're a new customer, it looks like you are pretty capable. I'd love to have you back. What if I brought you a, you know, what if I threw in some extra gear for your trouble?

[Speaker 4]
Keep talking.

[Speaker 1]
We have, like, if you bought the wrist caster at the price I listed, we have something called a, we have glide staves, which are also from the Zadaban. It takes a staff out and it unfolds a pair of insect wings. Like, these are pretty fun.

They're not really, they don't really let you fly, per se, unless you're pretty good at gliding. You could make use of some magic or whatever to use this. I haven't really seen it done myself.

Don't really have a need. But, you know, you could have, like, a glaive, a halberd, a lance, a pike, and you could use that to support yourself. Like, literally just jump off a cliff and this will carry you.

[Speaker 4]
We should get that for Monk.

[Speaker 12]
Give him little insect wings.

[Speaker 4]
I'm picturing, like, there's something in Avatar The Last Airbender.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, it's literally that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Alright, I think we can make this work. Anything you're interested in getting, Mimosa?

[Speaker 2]
I did like the wrist grappling.

[Speaker 4]
You are a trapper.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly. And also the staff of webbing, but I can pick just one. The wristband fits her better.

[Speaker 4]
I was saying, you can get more than one. We've got plenty of money. I'll cover you if you want.

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty sure she's got it. I just can't remember what they... Is the staff of webbing magical, or just...

[Speaker 1]
They're not magical, though. They are not even necessarily supernatural. They're just masterwork gear.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so that'll be two webbing gauntlets, one gliding staff, and you wanted a staff of webbing.

[Speaker 2]
No, just the wristband. Because Monk already has a staff that he's chill with, and Mimosa is...

[Speaker 4]
Well, if you're not getting it, then I'm going to get it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so the wristcaster, $1200 a piece, and then you're getting a... And for each of those that you purchase, you get a free glide staff.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. And then the staff of webbing?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, if you want to do...

[Speaker 1]
You can throw in like a staff of webbing instead of a glide staff with one of the...

[Speaker 2]
One glide staff, and then one staff of webbing. Alright.

[Speaker 4]
What do you say to $2200?

[Speaker 6]
Deal.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I was getting ready to have Mimosa roll an intimidation check. If he didn't take it.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to split that cost?

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Wow. That's alarming.

[Speaker 6]
Don't worry about it.

[Speaker 4]
Um. Sure. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it is, I'd say. I'm getting ready to swap with other customers here, but I wish you the best of luck in your travels, and please come to Resupply here.

[Speaker 4]
What was your name again? Just so we can find you in the future.

[Speaker 10]
Why am I sideways?

[Speaker 9]
Why am I sideways? What happened?

[Speaker 8]
Taking a nap.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa would be appalled. Alright. We can walk around some more.

[Speaker 1]
Can you come across a... Both of you make me a perception check. Or an insight check.

Whichever you prefer.

[Speaker 4]
He said perception or insight?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 8]
I'll do insight.

[Speaker 1]
You guys have noticed a taller side wearing a sort of conventional vest and dress clothes has been following you for a little while here. Close cropped hair, but like a really strangly beard. Older gentleman.

Or middle aged gentleman. He's getting towards like the end of his 40s probably. Got plenty of gray hairs mixed into the hair and beard.

Walking through. He's been following you probably since you took out the planet out of her bag.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh, it's the men in black. They cannot. They're not allowed to have my galaxy.

[Speaker 11]
Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Should we do a little bait and switch? Say quietly? Sure.

That's a good idea. I hide and you're the bait.

[Speaker 4]
Anything specific you want me to do? You want me to pretend to sprain my ankle or jump him?

[Speaker 2]
Or go down an alley. Like try to cut through an alley somewhere. I'll stealth and we'll see if we can catch him.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Splitting the party is always a great idea.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not splitting. I'm following you secretly.

[Speaker 4]
So yeah, Kyrona will pretend to be completely oblivious. As Mimosa vanishes. Continues walking down the street.

Chatting with her familiar. Can I get advantage from my familiar?

[Speaker 1]
Skylock is just going back and forth. No, I said don't look at him. Try to keep your eyes on that.

We're going to practice imbo energy. He's almost here. Nearly where Mimosa is.

And the gentleman says, excuse me, could you tell me where your smaller companion went?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, she has this curse that makes her turn invisible occasionally. She'll be back in a couple of hours.

[Speaker 6]
Give him advantage on me.

[Speaker 1]
2d20 Oh, that's interesting. She's small. That's fair.

This is going to sound odd, but I'm something of a collector of strange and interesting items.

[Speaker 4]
Aren't we all?

[Speaker 1]
You'd be surprised. A lot of people just can't seem to get rid of them. Even if they wanted to.

[Speaker 4]
You're interested in if she's looking to get rid of some things.

[Speaker 1]
Possibly. Possibly. It's just I go for a lot of curios around the realms and I try to make little connections between them and occasionally people actually hire me to go find curios if they so desire.

And I can't help but notice it looks like a tiny tiny little world in the palm of her hand. Was that like an illusion or a bit of stage magic or is that like some kind of magical like a magical item?

[Speaker 2]
I will say Mimosa probably is standing behind him so he can't run away or walk away.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he has not noticed her.

[Speaker 4]
Why don't you ask her yourself? And I gesture for him to turn around.

[Speaker 6]
Very good.

[Speaker 10]
You were looking for me?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, yes.

[Speaker 1]
I'm Alec. It's a pleasure to meet you. Ernie?

No, no. Ernie's my father. I'm Tom.

[Speaker 2]
I'm Mimosa.

[Speaker 1]
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Yes, so I'm a, I was just explaining to your friend here, I'm a collector of curios and I thought I saw you holding a curio and I was wondering if we might discuss it at my establishment.

[Speaker 8]
Are you, what would you, what do you want to discuss about it?

[Speaker 1]
Where you found it, qualities of the item, whether you know if it's, whether this is something unique or perhaps if there's, if there's more of them out there. I'd like to archive or catalog different collector's items. I'd be happy to do you a favor in return or even pay you for the pleasure.

[Speaker 11]
Hmm. I guess insight to see if he's a shady piece of shit.

[Speaker 8]
I'll give you advantage.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Does he have any kind of like special magical senses or anything like that?

[Speaker 2]
Just my post-seventeen intimidation.

[Speaker 4]
Give me one second.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Do you want me to wait on the roll then? Just a second.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry. You're fine. Skylark has this thing which you can read somebody's alignment.

Part sight. Sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If a target fails a DC 10 charisma saving throw, then the sprite also knows the creature's alignment.

Celestial beings and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
So it was a wisdom save. Is that correct?

[Speaker 4]
Charisma.

[Speaker 6]
It's going to be fun.

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't know his alignment, but you get a sense of distinct excitement. Very happy about the prospect of having found you folks.

[Speaker 4]
Skylark just kind of looks at Mimosas and shrugs. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
He's earnest. This is a genuine offer.

[Speaker 2]
Does my nat 20 insight tell me anything? I got a 27.

[Speaker 1]
He's definitely not like a... You can see it in his eyes. He definitely doesn't want you to say no.

This is not an interaction that he has no investment in. It's a little bit more intense than like a salesman just trying to get you something or get you to purchase something. There's some kind of personal investment here.

[Speaker 4]
Can I ask, sir, where do you come from? Where do I come from?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I spent a few years in Brackers, and I was supposedly born there, but I've spent most of my life in the astral tides. I've picked up quite a collection since then. I'd be happy to show you around.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want to insight him again on that?

[Speaker 1]
I can tell you now he's being truthful.

[Speaker 4]
Honestly, I just had this moment of, oh, is he from that planet?

[Speaker 2]
Mimosas is pretty chill with him right now. I'm remembering all the times she's gotten kidnapped or whatever. Fun times!

It's fine. She'll smile sweetly, like genuinely sweetly, instead of her intimidating sweet. Sure, I don't mind talking about it.

Honestly, any information about it would be helpful.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. I'm pleasantly happy about that. I guess we'll go to, let me escort you to my stage here.

[Speaker 4]
Before we change the scene, what you said about Mimosa getting kidnapped, I feel like Mimosa is the one character who is most likely to get that reaction of, you think you have her locked in with you? No, you're locked in with her.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, that's literally what happened with the knife. That is what happened with the knife.

[Speaker 2]
She got kidnapped and whisked away, and we're like, oh, she's not stuck with him, he's stuck with her.

[Speaker 3]
She could have stole half his arm.

[Speaker 1]
That wasn't the knife, that was... It was a knife.

[Speaker 3]
It was not THE knife, but it was a knife.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that didn't go great for it.

[Speaker 2]
Nope. Just one moment...Kyrona, do you have any message spells that we can tell Parra or... Yes, just like a, hey, we're going here.

[Speaker 4]
I can give Skylar a note and she can use it.

[Speaker 2]
I also have my Santa hat, so if you can't do that, I can send a message through the Santa hat to them. Yeah, I don't have a message you're sending. I'm just going to write a little quick note.

[Speaker 3]
You would know that Parra has both, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. She'll write a quick note to Parra. The city?

Okay, well...

[Speaker 1]
The city is huge. The biggest city that you've been to in Cemed has been Morellon, and this dwarfs it by comparison. This is not a city, this is a metroplex.

[Speaker 3]
I do have sending, though.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just write a little note and I'll get his exact address, and then I'll send it to Parra, and I'll be like, I'll check back in in three hours. If not, you can come and find us. And then I'll send it, and then you need to give me something back for it.

[Speaker 3]
I'll send you a stick of incense. Very good.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, we can go now. Whoops, I didn't mean to do that.

[Speaker 8]
I forget that clicking puts it in the... Oh, there you are.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, in the meantime, I'm going to switch themes. Paris, so you have been playing in a place called the Banelore's Eye, and a lot of people are, like, entertained, but there's, like, a lot of... You don't actually get that much time on stage.

There's a lot of bars, musicians trying to apply their craft here and make it big, so people cycle through. Something like that, right? Yeah, you get, like, a song or two, but you're one of the few who get an encore.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds right.

[Speaker 1]
And a few people, like, come to talk to you, ask you questions about music, where are you from, how's your relationship with your dad, where'd you buy those shoes, and a lot of mundane stuff. Also, a few people start asking you, like, hey, do you need any favors? Are you here for something?

So if you're, like, big city, like, you get lost pretty quickly. Are you looking for anybody?

[Speaker 13]
Well, I'm looking for a ship captain, preferably a ship.

[Speaker 1]
Right, you know, that gets a decent number of them to kind of, like, file off.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, sure.

[Speaker 1]
Helps your purposes. But a few are remaining, like, yeah, yeah, a ship captain. I mean, we're with a crew, and we have a ship captain.

[Speaker 5]
You also have a crew, well, companions.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We're looking for a, what is it, a ship that can withstand fire.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, like gunfire.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
You've heard of Brilliance, right? The Realm, or whatever we call it here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, a lot of people refer to it in a lot of different places. I've never been to one.

[Speaker 5]
The fireplace, what is it called? Is it called Brilliance?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no. Brilliance of Ion. Ion?

Ion.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Ion? Ion, okay.

I'll tell them. Um, we're looking for passage to Ion.

[Speaker 1]
So, Ion. Yeah, I suppose it'd be, definitely assist you with that, maybe. Our captain's in a bit of a rough spot right now.

Do you think that you'd be able to, I think if you helped him, he'd be happy to assist you back.

[Speaker 5]
What kind of rough spot?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, he owes some money.

[Speaker 9]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
His shipment got, uh, like, there's some really fine wine that was supposed to go to the to the queen.

[Speaker 12]
Oh, Munkle help.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Royal wine. We were supposed to order a shipment of ducal wine from a facility out in the out in a place controlled by the IP.

It's kind of a secret. It was our first time on the job, and then we went over there, and then we opened the cargo hold to offload it, and there was no wine. So, the queen put the captain in jail, and I'm pretty sure that we've been getting spied on for, like, since.

We don't know what to do and we're running out of money.

[Speaker 5]
Um, she's gonna silently tell Orion to, like, kind of look around a little bit. Um, see if there's people watching them. I'm sure he knows some kind of thieves can't write.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Um. Hmm.

[Speaker 6]
He's a changeling, so it's pretty easy for him.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Um. And where is he being held?

[Speaker 6]
Below the city.

[Speaker 5]
Does he need to get out legally, or...? I would never say to do anything illegal.

[Speaker 1]
That's not the only problem. The other problem is that he's shipped. He's actually stuck.

Like, it's been impounded.

[Speaker 13]
Ooh. That sounds fun.

[Speaker 1]
Him getting out of jail doesn't necessarily solve all of our problems. We still have to deal with the fact that we don't really have any. This is not a great place to get stuck.

I mean, it's a big city. It's not like, you know, it's not paradise here, as far as crime goes. There's always people messing about.

But man, we would not want to get stuck here without our ships as a means of getting off. And quite frankly, I don't really hate to...I'm trying to find somebody to help him out as kind of like a last favor, but I feel like I've gotten off lucky not having to deal with him getting, like, me not being in jail. Like, I hadn't been charged with anything.

[Speaker 5]
I'll have a chat with my companions and meet you back here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just whatever you can do. Keep an eye out for a missing shipment of wine.

[Speaker 13]
Missing shipment of wine.

[Speaker 1]
Got it. And I hope you get your transport there.

[Speaker 5]
And I hope you get your captain, which we may be able to help. But I can't see all of us. And she will fly out of the tavern and meet up with Orion, see if he saw any spies.

[Speaker 1]
They got guys on the roof, looking in. I'll be back in a couple minutes. There's one invisible guy sitting on a chandelier that was definitely staring at them.

Different associations, too. A few of them had the symbol of the queen, which is generic grounds. Any of them followed?

Followed us? No. I did change into your shape and then lose a tail close to the outside in the alleyway, though.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. She will try to meet up with the rest of the crew. I don't know how scattered everyone is, but she'll try anyway.

[Speaker 6]
Meantime, Hera.

[Speaker 3]
I did not see a ship that specifically had fire immunity.

[Speaker 1]
So the way that you get through fire is not by... The way that you get through fire in The Astral Tides is not just like having... Let me construct that into a full sentence before I start speaking.

The way that you get through the fire of brilliance is by traveling through a portal at a time of day, or a specific time, like a specific place. So natural expressions of brilliance do exist. They do have places that you can travel through.

The natural portals are rarer, but they do exist, usually flying through the sun of a given world will take you to that world's brilliance. Of course, sometimes there's more than one world in a given place, and that causes a few problems, but, you know, it's still a thing. And so if you fly through the portal, is that the immunity conferred by the gateways is only for the ambient effects of the environment, which would normally just cause you to burst into flame upon entry.

If you find a pool of water, it'll be warm or a hot spring, but if you plunge yourself into lava, you'll still die. Not given persistence or immunity to fire damage in this process. And so no ships are really built for this, because it's not a place that people go to frequently, and it's also because it's so ridiculously dangerous.

But if you go through, basically you have to adhere to procedure and timing, then you're good.

[Speaker 2]
I remember now. There's like a certain time where if we go, we get...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if I remember correctly, noon is the best time, because you'll get the longest time.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like, you get it until you leave.

[Speaker 1]
Only if both of them aren't noon. So there's one thing I was wrong about, because I forgot. If you were to fly through the sun, then you would need to have total immunity to fire and confer to the occupants for a period of time.

But if you flew into the sun, then you wouldn't have to worry about being... yeah, it lasts until you leave the Brilliance.

[Speaker 5]
Did I hear something about fire immunity? Like, we all need that? Not if we go at the right time.

It would be good to look into anyway, getting it completely. There's gotta be some kind of fire resistant, or not resistant, but fire immunity magic item that we can collect.

[Speaker 4]
Well, we've got several weeks of downtime. Your microphone has been turned away from your face. Oh, sorry, thank you for reminding me.

We have several weeks of downtime, so Kyrona could craft something like that, assuming other people are willing to pitch in on the remote remodel of the ship, so she can do other tasks.

[Speaker 6]
That's not a bad idea.

[Speaker 1]
For Moroni, you are still doing the... you're still following your plan for... you're following your plan to basically turn this into a little bit more fey, or a little bit more...

[Speaker 4]
At least less spidery. Make it more fey! Something that doesn't read Niyogi on first glance, at least.

Because people will shoot at that as soon as they see it.

[Speaker 5]
Charis is not really one to get her hands dirty when it comes to labor, but she will absolutely help a little bit if it's fairy related.

[Speaker 2]
And then Elsa will help. And then if it fits, Monk will help too, but I don't know how that would work.

[Speaker 5]
He can provide entertainment.

[Speaker 1]
Uh-huh. So Peridot, you're going to be walking around and asking a lot of people for assistance with this, which is going to be handy for you, because you'll be able to provide them... you'll meet plenty of people who are able to provide you with more pointers.

Are there any ships that caught your eye or were super fancy?

[Speaker 3]
I saw some cute images. Hang on, I have to get back to it. I scrolled up.

I know there was one that was a demonic ship, but I only looked at that one because it had the resistance to fire, and that was what was in my head. The airships are also the spaceships?

[Speaker 1]
The airships are generally not the spaceships.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, which ones are the spacey ships then?

[Speaker 1]
All the vehicles are grouped by world, not by function.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was looking at the operation though, and I didn't see spacey.

[Speaker 1]
Anything that's a conveyance will work in space and will take you through the realms. It just requires a helm to use.

[Speaker 4]
I just found the Dragonglass Skycutter. It has elemental immunity.

[Speaker 1]
I believe that one is normally an airship, but I'm recalling from memory, so if you're looking at it now, feel free to correct me. Right, but if you're looking for something like that, then somebody could tell you, hey, people do conversions all the time. Treat it like a 2007 Ford Focus.

If you were looking for one that could travel around the... If you're looking for one that could travel the planes as well, there's bound to be somebody around here. Or you could get it specially ordered.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, so the Birdwing that I was talking about isn't under the airships. It just says Operation Air. And so does the Dragonglass Skycutter.

It's technically under the conveyances of the Dragonkin.

[Speaker 1]
Is that other magical vehicles?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. It's under where you had your conveyances. You told me to use the...

[Speaker 1]
Like I said, because they're grouped by... They're all grouped by world. So the conveyances and the other vehicles are in the same place.

Actually, wait, is that true? Yes, that is true.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, because there's the conveyances, and then after that, there's a bunch of airships. That's why I'm... Because these are all grouped by Dwarven, Elven, Dragonkin.

And then if I scroll down way further, there's airships, like the Combat Skiff and the Cloudskate.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, okay, no, that's perfect.

[Speaker 3]
And then there's the other magical vehicles.

[Speaker 4]
It is a little confusing, my book.

[Speaker 1]
That one is a... I was wrong. That one is a conveyance.

The Dragonglass Skycutter.

[Speaker 3]
And it has a one pilot, twenty crew possibility. Major Mage Helm. What is Major Mage?

I think there's like bits and pieces, because I was scrolling through all these tags and stuff, and it sounds like that's kind of what they are? Am I understanding it right? Are there...

These are helms. We're trying to figure out what the Major Mage Helm... Mage Helm!

Major Mage Helm! HR-5. Or HR-9.

What's an HR?

[Speaker 1]
That's a helm rating. So they have different ratings depending on... Let's see here.

Vessel pilots make a navigation role when making a plane or jump. The helm being used across the course of navigation adds its HR rating to the navigation role. So when you're making a plane or jump, there's different DCs depending on what kind of place you're looking for.

There are complications that modify the role. There are boons that modify the role. And then there are some resolutions based on how close or how far away you get to the...

[Speaker 3]
Major Helms increase the vessel's speed by ten times the spellcaster's highest available spell slot. That's kind of fun. Zippy.

Okay, so yeah, there's information about them. That's cool. Is 21 people enough of a...

What's it called?

[Speaker 6]
A crew? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
But I don't know how many people we're going to have with us.

[Speaker 1]
That's right. They do have to be sailors. They have to know how to move the...

They have to know how to move sails around, literally, and maintain the ship. But that's not going to be terribly difficult to find in a place like this. They're just hirelings.

[Speaker 3]
The Dragonglass Barge has ten extra people, too. Oh, wait, there's passengers!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, that's not like a limit on how many people. Well...

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so the crew is how many crewmates we need, and then the passengers is how many people we can carry?

[Speaker 1]
How many people it typically comes with.

[Speaker 3]
Comes with?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if you're encountering this out in the world, this is how many people you're typically going to see on there. But again, you could stack more, it's just like, maybe it's going to be a little bit more craft, or maybe it's going to be, you know.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so there's definitely enough room on this thing for our entire gamut of people. Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Which one are we looking at specifically?

[Speaker 3]
The Dragonglass Skycutter? The one you had? With the elemental immunity?

And a VTOL? What's a VTOL?

[Speaker 1]
VTOL is just Vertical Takeoff and Landing. So you don't have to, you don't need like a runway or anything like that in order to drag it upwards.

[Speaker 5]
VTOL, like in Call of Duty?

[Speaker 1]
That's like a turfed... Call of Duty got it from the same place that I did. People were using that for helicopters before Call of Duty was made.

Yeah, some conveyances. Conveyances with the VTOL tag can increase their rate of ascent or descent by spending their movement. Citadel, ground, why did I not put that in alphabetical order?

Why not? I was having trouble with layout. Elemental resistance slash immunity says this vessel is resistant or immune to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder damage.

Some of them are just like water, too.

[Speaker 4]
What's fire in there?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
The one I liked is not in there. Dang. What are you looking for?

Oh, there was one that was shaped like a millipede and I thought that was cute.

[Speaker 1]
Which one are you... Because you get add tags. Again, if you get one commissioned, it's just more downtime and you're getting more...

[Speaker 3]
I don't even remember where it was. This is artillery. I don't know where it went.

There was one that said it had a bunch of legs and I thought that was really funny.

[Speaker 1]
That would have been in Zahaman.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, this is down in these things. Yes, here it is. Not the Pfeifer.

Centichore. Which very much just also says land. Oh wait, are these the air shippies?

[Speaker 1]
The centichore is... that just means you can't make it float, and you can't park it inside. And you can't park it in water.

But it can still travel throughout the realms because it's a... that's what it's for. It is a conveyance.

It can travel through the realms. It's just going to do so usually not in space, and definitely it's not going to do it through the astral tides. It's going to go through things like the elemental planes.

It's going to travel through limbo to get where it wants to go. And were you looking at another one?

[Speaker 3]
There's a couple more in here, but they're very small, so I don't think we'd have enough space for all our people. Like the lance and the leech.

[Speaker 1]
The millipede.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so if the dragon glass thingy works, that'd probably be our best shot, I think, with the elemental immunities.

[Speaker 1]
Not a bad idea. You're going to search for it. Go ahead and tell me a little bit about the search method.

Oh, cool. You put it there. And then we're going to take a quick break.

I'm going to come back. We're going to resolve the curios thing. And then we'll have to close up shop a little bit early because I have work at 5.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
I picked up a few extra shifts, so I have extra shifts to worry about, but that's fine. I requested them specifically.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a specific way to search? I'm just picturing going through a mall.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, here's the thing. There's always research. There's always divination.

There's prayers, stuff like that. What's a legend lore for me? There's spells like legend lore.

You have access to plenty of those.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I do. I could totally legend lore. That sounds fun.

Legend lore for a ship sprying wouldn't help.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, my goodness.

[Speaker 3]
I can commune with three questions, but those are yes or no only, and I'm not smart enough to figure out questions.

[Speaker 1]
Just find somebody who is.

[Speaker 2]
I was just thinking that.

[Speaker 1]
But, yeah, if you want more, this map's going to be so pretty. Need to make sure I turn out. I'm going to really have to crank up the contrast, though.

[Speaker 3]
Thoroughbonds isn't what I'm thinking it is.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to go break early.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm going to go break now.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to think about questions.

[Speaker 5]
How much time do we have left?

[Speaker 1]
About half an hour.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't sleep much, so I'm very spacey.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't sleep well. I slept. I fell asleep in a seated position, which sucks.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I've been sleeping on a couch for like a week now, and I have another week to go. So I've been kind of napping throughout the day. I just nap.

I don't sleep.

[Speaker 2]
My son has turned into a husky. Whining.

[Speaker 3]
Turning into? You mean he wasn't already?

[Speaker 2]
Husky is coming out more because he's just walking around whining. You mean he's screaming? Yeah.

Imagine a husky whines and how they whine over everything. That's kind of what he's doing.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's so funny.

[Speaker 2]
What do you want, buddy? He wants in the fridge, but now he's just sitting down and chilling. Oh, you want cheese?

He wants cheese, but we don't have any cheese.

[Speaker 5]
What's his favorite kind of cheese?

[Speaker 2]
String cheese. And we're out of it. Now he's so mad at me.

I'm going to see if he'll take some mozzarella sticks.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

[Speaker 3]
String cheese and mozzarella sticks are the same thing, aren't they? Oh, wait. Mozzarella sticks are cooked, though.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, mozzarella sticks are cooked.

[Speaker 3]
I was just thinking a stick of mozzarella. Nessie, what kind of questions with yes or no do you think would be pertinent?

[Speaker 2]
To getting to brilliance or finding a ship?

[Speaker 3]
Finding a ship, getting to brilliance, either or. I have three of them to play with.

[Speaker 2]
I guess the first one, like, is there a ship that's resistant to fire? Or no, we know that, right? I don't know.

Is there a ship? Where's the ship?

[Speaker 3]
Do not dig at that, you jerk.

[Speaker 2]
Those are just my first thoughts.

[Speaker 3]
Well, where the ship wouldn't work, because it has to be yes or no. I mean, I guess if we can narrow it down to one question, divination might be better.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Today's probably not the best day to ask me. I'm so overstimulated and dyspopulated.

[Speaker 3]
That's the problem. I can't use divination if I don't know a question. I'm bad at questions.

[Speaker 2]
I know.

[Speaker 3]
Hey God, can I have a ship? So, I don't know. We're figuring out if we can get a dragonglass skycutter somehow.

[Speaker 5]
Ask for the location of one. The nearest location of that ship.

[Speaker 2]
That's the demon ship, right?

[Speaker 3]
No, this is a dragon kin ship.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So, like, dragonborns, I'm guessing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Mosmols. It's a dragonborn ship? It says dragon kin, not necessarily dragonborn.

[Speaker 5]
We could just go be racist and ask all the dragonborn that we see. Where to find one?

[Speaker 3]
But, I mean, that is a good reason why to ask, like, my God. So, this is like a research thing, which I'm bad at. And I knew I was bad at it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, ask where the nearest location is, if that's a thing that you can do with divination.

[Speaker 3]
Concerning a specific goal, event, or activity.

[Speaker 2]
I know, buddy.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, I knew.

[Speaker 2]
So silly. I'm holding him, he's pretty chill, and then he's like, wait, no, I'm not. And then we'll whine.

I heard, that was adorable. Do you want some Cheerios? Do you want some cereal while you wait for your matchsticks?

No, okay.

[Speaker 3]
How can we acquire a ship that can take us to Ion's Brilliance safely? Uh, I don't like that safely. I feel like that's ambiguous.

[Speaker 2]
Where do we find it? Because how? I feel like it's going to be like, look around.

Go ask so-and-so.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, but I'm God's specialest little princess.

[Speaker 2]
That's true. You're Miss Charlotte Leboff. Now, Charlotte, this is your last dress.

I'm not getting you anything more. Now, who wants a puppy? I feel like that is Para's relationship.

Zachy! Now he's mad I switched him from right side to left side. You're a silly Billy boy.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. Where can we acquire a ship that can safely take us to Ion's Brilliance?

[Speaker 5]
What if we can't get there safely? What if there isn't a safe way? And they're like, well, you can't.

Well, then we'd find that out.

[Speaker 3]
And then we would know how to do that. But there is a safe way to get there. Because we know there's a safe way.

That's going to be the question, and I'm going to use divination. Womp. Womp.

I mean, there is the temptation to divine intervene something, but also I don't feel like I should use my god to steal a ship. Hey, god, can you just birth a ship for us?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we have to kill everything on board.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like we could handle that.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's easy peasy. We got that. The city might not be very happy about it.

[Speaker 2]
You have stuff in your hair. What is it? Oh, it's marshmallow from the cereal.

Listen, you can't keep that in your hair.

[Speaker 3]
I'm actually surprised more people didn't show up. I thought there were more people who were interested.

[Speaker 2]
It was probably the time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, a lot of people disappeared.

[Speaker 2]
Is he going to ask to be let in?

[Speaker 8]
Oh, he's in the audience.

[Speaker 2]
Why is he adding me?

[Speaker 5]
I can't let him in. How long has he been in the audience?

[Speaker 3]
He just joined, because I just switched off of it. Move to invite to speak, I guess.

[Speaker 9]
You may speak.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
So the session's kind of winding down already.

[Speaker 2]
There's about 30 more minutes, I think, once James gets back.

[Speaker 7]
At the very least, I can level up Corpus, because holy shit. I've been trying to get the XP and stuff in.

[Speaker 2]
He can help, I guess, us find a question. Or did we already figure that out?

[Speaker 3]
I mean, if he can figure out a better question, we're trying to find a shit. It doesn't sound like he's going to be able to find a question. We're all pretty tired.

[Speaker 7]
Hey, look, I just woke up. I'm super smart right now. What's the question?

[Speaker 3]
We're trying to figure out what a good question would be for asking Para's god to see if our god can help us figure out where to get a dragonglass skycutter.

[Speaker 7]
The fuck is a dragonglass skycutter?

[Speaker 2]
It's a cool ship. So we can fly into the sun without burning.

[Speaker 3]
Right now the question is, where can we acquire a ship that can safely take us to Ion's Brilliance? Which, honestly, I feel like is our best question, because it's a little more maybe we won't necessarily get the one we want, but maybe we'll get a quest to do it. How much is this thing?

Yeah, I think I have enough to actually buy this ship outright.

[Speaker 2]
Go lay down on the couch and go to sleep. You insane child. Go.

[Speaker 3]
Oh wait, did we get money? For my last one?

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna put it all into gold, because fuck Electrum.

[Speaker 7]
So do I go away of the- I could go on a level in Barbarian, so I can just get Barototem and then not have to worry for the rest of times. And I might do it.

[Speaker 5]
How do I do this? How do I use the manage currency thing? Because I've just made all of my gold into Electrum, and I don't know how to change it back.

Convert? No. I don't know what to do.

Once you've converted it, I don't think you can. Okay, I can just use a Google converter. Oh, I see it's already there.

I've done this before.

[Speaker 2]
There is a site that I usually use that converts it for me. I don't know if you were just doing that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I have enough money. I could just buy a Dragonblast Skycutter right out the gate. We would just need the crew, which we kind of have.

Yeah, you've got the legendary Corpus Anima, the best- No, you don't get to touch my ship. You get to stay on the Mindspider.

[Speaker 7]
Fine, I like the Mindspider better anyways.

[Speaker 10]
You get the little dinghy that's tied to the ship.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sorry, who here has seen Disney's Atlantis?

[Speaker 2]
That's exactly what I was picturing. When he's like, oh yeah, I've driven before. And then he's just like just tied to it.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I've driven before. Oh shit. I didn't expect that to happen.

[Speaker 2]
He did the classic reverse instead of forward. You guys, you can- For realsies, there you go. There's your blankie, you silly boy.

[Speaker 7]
So yeah, I'm actually kind of psyched. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go three levels into Barbarian, but I was like, bro, Totem Warrior is just too good to pass up right now. 167 hit points, god damn.

[Speaker 5]
I debated making Gibi a Totem Warrior or a Totem Barbarian, but I decided Beast would be better. Just fits. You know, she's not as dumb as I- wait.

Yeah, she's not as dumb as I play her sometimes. She has an intelligence of 13. Her charisma is 9.

I think she just gets distracted really easily. And she's bad at talking to people.

[Speaker 10]
Aww, who is this?

[Speaker 5]
Gibi.

[Speaker 10]
Aww, that's sweet.

[Speaker 5]
Only if you're friendly!

[Speaker 6]
Hello. Gramps! No.

[Speaker 1]
The otter has let you in. Against my wishes.

[Speaker 9]
Fuck you.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here, yeah, so they were actually calling me in slightly earlier than I originally expected, but that's fine.

[Speaker 5]
You're abandoning us now?

[Speaker 1]
I'll be abandoning you soon, like in ten minutes. Let's see here, so I think we were last leaving off was Nessie and Bar. You two were talking with this- going to this fellow's place so that he could ask you a few questions about the planet.

[Speaker 4]
Which is hopefully not a euphemism for anything. We could take him. Oh, you mean like in a fight?

[Speaker 12]
Yes, what did you mean? Nevermind.

[Speaker 1]
He's fucking smiling. Well, because I'm remembering my prohibition on roleplaying sex at the table.

[Speaker 5]
What did I just miss?

[Speaker 4]
Me making a sex joke and then getting my bluff called on it.

[Speaker 9]
You kidding?

[Speaker 1]
You meant like in a fight, right? God, fuck.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, we did just get those restraining pieces.

[Speaker 1]
I don't even know what you're referring to. I'm a scientist, I remember.

[Speaker 5]
That was the place my mind immediately went, by the way. Those things were brought out.

[Speaker 2]
My first thought was Spider-Man, where the hell is your head at? The same place yours was, like a minute ago? None of you are free soon.

[Speaker 5]
Indeed, true.

[Speaker 12]
Anyway, let's see what this nerd wants.

[Speaker 1]
Chatting with you folks brings you up to a study. He does have quite a large collection, it's like a small personal library. You think of like a community library, basically, as far as the code out of this place.

Like a small bookstore. You're brought out. Tell me about this little world that you found.

[Speaker 10]
Well, didn't you pull it out fishing? I did find it fishing.

[Speaker 2]
I found it...oh man, what was it called exactly? Was it just like Space Serpent?

[Speaker 3]
Was it like a World Eater?

[Speaker 1]
World Eater, the Night Serpent.

[Speaker 2]
World Eater, the Night Serpent. We were going against him in a ballad. And I hooked him and plucked out a planet.

[Speaker 1]
That's quite the tale. What can you tell me about the planet itself?

[Speaker 2]
It was dormant until we came here, and now it's moving around. That's really...she'll get a look at him and then she'll pull it out of her bag and hold it in her hand. Now it's moving.

[Speaker 1]
It's very interested in looking at it now. What do you mean here? Certainly in some kind of activated state.

I suppose it's from this place, or maybe it's just a little bit more...need a little bit more encouragement in order to come out. How much would you, if you were to part with this, how much would what would be your price for it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's a good question. It's pretty priceless.

[Speaker 1]
Humor me, please.

[Speaker 9]
Ask him for a ship!

[Speaker 10]
Give me a moment.

[Speaker 2]
I would say a Dragonglass Skycutter would be equal in trade.

[Speaker 6]
That's pretty specific, but not that I mind, of course.

[Speaker 2]
We're looking for a ship that can fly through the sun.

[Speaker 1]
May I ask why?

[Speaker 2]
We need to get to Brilliance, specifically Ion.

[Speaker 1]
Into Ion's Brilliance. That's fascinating. Yes, I have a few couriers from that place.

I'm meant to travel there one day myself. It's quite good for curing afflictions, but at the moment I do still have my work ahead of me. I suppose I could arrange that.

I certainly have the funds for it. Anything else that you need?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hmm. Anything else we need?

[Speaker 1]
If you need information on anything, please feel free to stop by. I do have so many artifacts of the planes around here, and he does indeed. He has plenty of stuff that's labeled as explicitly out of the local cluster of worlds.

Energy weapons, small light transportation devices, simple mundane weapons, magical artifacts. He just has a ton of shit on his balls here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You're a well-traveled person.

[Speaker 6]
Very much so.

[Speaker 4]
I speak with people who are well-traveled. Can Karona look around and see if there's anything she recognizes?

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Just send me a message.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you don't want me to roll?

[Speaker 6]
No, you can go ahead and roll.

[Speaker 1]
Also, I sent you a message here. You recognize a Model T engine. A Ford Model T.

Among other things, there are plenty of...

[Speaker 12]
Is that the one that Tad took away?

[Speaker 1]
Is that the one that what took away?

[Speaker 2]
This song, Daddy Took My T-Bird Away.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I never heard that.

[Speaker 4]
Karona just stares at it for a long time and doesn't say anything about it. I mean, it's not like it would be a useful purchase.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Well, you can see several radios in the vein of the Black Box. Two of them likely from World War I.

So, War on the Backpack. There's a few firearms that are of similar quality. There's like a 1911 there.

What else am I thinking of? Oh, there are a few artifacts of the Fae that are clearly not from Braccus, but are a little bit more in tune with the specific symbols there that look like they're from Ireland, which you know to be not from Ireland, but have actually originated in a slightly older place.

[Speaker 6]
They're used in Ireland.

[Speaker 4]
Were these things that you gathered yourself or traded for?

[Speaker 1]
Not all of them. Many I did trade for myself. I've been, you know, I've been around, but people mostly come to be looking for things.

So, I give them, and for the chief thing I trade in is information, and I get little curios out of it like this. You'd be surprised how useful they are.

[Speaker 4]
Do you have anything that would say knock a Fae down a couple of pegs?

[Speaker 1]
I have anything that would knock a Fae down a couple of pegs. Yeah. Yes, I have a...

[Speaker 6]
give me just a moment...

[Speaker 1]
Actually, I don't know if that one would be for sale. But I'm happy to show it to you. It takes out a musket, and it is a smoothbore muzzle-loaded musket.

It has a casing made for six bullets, rather large bullets. Sorry, it's not smoothbore. It's rifled, actually.

It's a rifled barrel. So, right at the time where people were using more pointy bullets because you could have them, if you rifled the barrel, you could have those spin. That would keep the bullet basically on track.

This is right at that time, right before moving on to more lever action or bolt action rifles from the same time period. And yeah, the casing, he has a casing that's made for six silver bullets, but there are only five in there. I'm showing this to you now because I can't sell this to you.

It's something of a personal heirloom, but you can, if you end up finding it somewhere else, then for something like it, I recommend it. This is a... any old weapon that incorporates silver or quartz silver is going to give you a pretty significant advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Steal it. No, he's a new friend. We don't steal from friends.

[Speaker 4]
Kyrona is going to open her bag of holding and pull out something she's been holding onto for quite a while. It's a Christine Grishcade. What does that do?

[Speaker 6]
It's like a bazooka made by the bay.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Well, you said you wouldn't be willing to trade that item. Would you consider loaning it to me for a short amount of time in return for this item for you to keep?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, but I could definitely still provide you with some assistance here. I understand the importance. If you have that drift card, and you leave it with me for a little while, I can definitely find some ammunition for it or something that's good to knock your Fey down a peg or two.

[Speaker 4]
Now that sounds perfect.

[Speaker 1]
One other note of curiosity, did you ever figure out the name of this little world that you've been hanging onto?

[Speaker 2]
I don't believe I did.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you don't have to leave it with me. I'm going to commission a Dryden Glass Skycutter. If you have any specific requirements we can always negotiate up or down with a bit of gold here.

But it's going to take me about a month for the vessel to actually get here. One month at a time. So you're free to do as you wish, of course.

He brings out a contract for you folks. Obviously you can't lose this in the meantime.

[Speaker 5]
Oh boy. I have a feeling you're going to be rubbling some things.

[Speaker 1]
It's a very simple contract. If you were expected to pay the cost of the Dryden Glass Skycutter, plus any kind of basically fees for the inconvenience, like 65% charge on the contract. If you choose not to provide the item, you end up losing it.

If it's not provided for the point of exchange, which will be in one month. I need to get ready to get going.

[Speaker 2]
I do have a question that I can wait until next time for him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, possibly an RP channel?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, we could do it in the RP channel.

[Speaker 1]
I don't get to use it enough.

[Speaker 2]
Oh shit, we can do that in a downtime then.

[Speaker 1]
Drop a bunch of shit in the RP channel and I will be happy to oblige. I'm going to hop out of the Mimosa will sign it after meticulously reading the contract. It is as I described.

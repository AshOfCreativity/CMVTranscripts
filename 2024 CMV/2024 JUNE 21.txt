[Heart]
world warming up. I can't remember which horror movie it is, maybe The Think. But someone said at the end of it, they managed to freeze it.

And when they're like, Oh, hey, so what happens? As long as the iceberg doesn't unfreeze, we're all safe. And the person making the post saying that was, as a child, that scared me.

But I was like, fine, because you know, the icebergs will stay frozen forever. As an adult who's a climate scientist, it did not help.

[Baar-Ur]
What a time to be a climate scientist. I don't think that was The Thing. I think it was Aliens vs.

Predator.

[Heart]
Maybe it was two different posts.

[Baar-Ur]
I'm basing this not on seeing the post, but on my memory of The Thing and Alien vs. Predator.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, because The Thing was released because I like The Thing. Oh, have you seen the newer Things bar? I have not.

I've only seen the classic. Because I wonder if the newer Things might have gone with it.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, absolutely.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, if you ever want a really short version of it, look up the Pengu Thing.

[Baar-Ur]
The what?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Pengu. Pengu Thing.

[Baar-Ur]
Like Newt Newt? Newt Newt. Oh, you asked me!

[(Finneas)]
I haven't misheard you.

[Heart]
Thank you.

[(Finneas)]
You need like a high tolerance for body horror if you're gonna watch The Thing, just so you know.

[Heart]
Ah, thank you. I actually did get that warning. I will keep that in mind.

[Baar-Ur]
I think that Alien vs. Predator is one of the best monster fucker movies out there.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, because Nessie showed that one to me saying the exact same thing.

[(Frogitha)]
Excuse me, I checked out for a minute and come back to what?

[(Finneas)]
People praising Alien vs. Predator. I love Alien and I love Predator, but I hate Alien vs.

Predator. I'm very interested to see what virtues you think it has.

[Speaker 10]
Uh, sexy.

[Baar-Ur]
Sexy monster fucker? It's not terribly good, but it is a great monster fucker movie.

[(Finneas)]
What does that mean? I don't know if that is supposed to communicate to me.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
The Predator is hot.

[Baar-Ur]
It means not only the Predator is hot, but the Predator works alongside a human woman, and basically she becomes incredibly sexy to him through her actions and deeds through the course of the movie.

[(Finneas)]
It's a compliment to lovers. Yeah, this is basically Bridgerton.

[Baar-Ur]
Interspecies Bridgerton.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, if it was written by Quentin Tarantino.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think Nessie's first Alien crush was the Predator from Predator vs. Aliens.

[(Frogitha)]
First Alien crush?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Actually, I don't know if she actually watched the Predator movies first or Predator Aliens.

[(Finneas)]
You are one ugly motherfucker.

[(Frogitha)]
I actually watched the Predator movie for the first time the other day.

[(Finneas)]
The first one? Or one of the later ones?

[(Frogitha)]
No, the first one.

[(Finneas)]
So good. I like that it switches genres about a third of the way through to a straight horror film.

[Baar-Ur]
Which one?

[(Finneas)]
The first Predator. It starts off like an action commando movie, and then it becomes a slasher flick.

[(Frogitha)]
It's definitely a cool monster design. I was really impressed with it, especially for the time periods. Really cool monster design.

[(Finneas)]
I like that it was different from stuff that had come before. Nowadays, a lot of Alien design is either aping the xenomorphs from Alien, or Cthulhu tentacle stuff, or weird, highly vaginal openings.

[Heart]
More human, but green.

[(Finneas)]
Oh yeah, that's true. Bumpy foreheads, the Star Trek and exploration school of things.

[Baar-Ur]
You can't go wrong with tentacles. That's true.

[(Finneas)]
I liked the Alien design in Arrival.

[Baar-Ur]
They were funky, yeah.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, they were weird. I like Mindbendy. Although, Annihilation probably had the best, the absolute best Alien design.

[Baar-Ur]
I liked the first three quarters of the movie, but the last bit was just...

[(Finneas)]
You didn't like the 30-minute dialogue-free acid trip?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, it was abstract, to say the least.

[(Finneas)]
I loved it. That's exactly my kind of sci-fi horror stuff.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
2001 Space Odyssey does the same thing. I remember watching that movie and getting to the end and being like, what the fuck just happened?

[(Finneas)]
What? The giant baby? Huh?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What? I don't watch enough movies, man.

[(Frogitha)]
People are always so surprised at the amount of movies that I just have not watched or even heard of.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Usually same, but I'm a horror buff, so I've seen a lot of horror movies and stuff.

[(Finneas)]
Have you seen Die Hard, at least, Fargotha?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's been a clean year. I think so.

[Baar-Ur]
Introducing Skittles! Die Hard is my favorite Christmas movie. Yes, I have seen it.

[(Finneas)]
Best Christmas movie of all time, and the best action movie of all time.

[Baar-Ur]
It was definitely a Christmas movie.

[(Finneas)]
Die Hard is home alone for grown-ups.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Nessie and I did a solo D&D game where it was based off Die Hard, and she played a bugbear chef.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, that's basically, that's like Under Siege. Back when Steven Seagal could make an action movie. He's still never got any good one-liners.

I don't know if any of you have ever seen Steven Seagal movies. There's this one where he's fighting against this corrupt senator. He's ordering death squats against him, and he's watching him on TV.

He's hiding out in a hotel, and he sees him on TV, and the senator is like, You can take that to the bank! And he's like, says to the TV, I'm going to take you to the bank, senator. To the blood bank.

[(Frogitha)]
Dear god.

[(Finneas)]
It's the worst one-liner of all time.

[(Frogitha)]
Who's writing this?

[Speaker 11]
Possibly Steven Seagal himself.

[(Frogitha)]
Sounds like something I'd come up with, just to be nonsensical. It's like a Your Mom joke.

[Referee (James)]
I'm going to go get set up, and I just need to get my coffee out. All right, where did we leave off last? You guys just killed a large elemental.

Reconsecrated a shrunk.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, I guess we just set up here? Camped for the night?

[(Finneas)]
Um, I mean, I don't feel like- If we can't keep traveling, then yeah, it makes sense to camp here.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Do we need to camp? Are we low on any resources? I think I used one spell.

[(Finneas)]
I mean, looking at the game clock, it only looks like it's early afternoon.

[Heart]
Okay. I suppose it's a matter of, do you want to be all full up when we get to the horror zone, or are you fine with going little depletion?

[Speaker 8]
How much further until we see the windows?

[(Finneas)]
I cast a couple high-level spells.

[(Frogitha)]
I'm only missing one spell.

[Baar-Ur]
Let's see. James, I rolled... I think I rolled...

to harvest stuff on this island, and you never gave me anything.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, go ahead and write down some elemental salts.

[Baar-Ur]
Are they a specific element, or just- You can write down air.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you.

[Heart]
You're sort of capturing gas in a bottle.

[Referee (James)]
No, no, it just like leaves these little salts, like literally salt, behind. I don't know.

[Baar-Ur]
I was thinking like, oh, the frozen gas? The solid ice? Oh, like- Aerogel?

Dry ice? Yes, thank you. Like dry ice, but it never runs out.

So it's just continually smoking.

[Speaker 8]
That's cool.

[Referee (James)]
I like that a lot.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I need to go grab some things to keep my hands busy while we're gaming, so I'll be right back.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
James, I've just discovered you can create a scroll. Um, by right-clicking on the spell. I didn't know you could do that in this one.

[Speaker 8]
Pretty cool.

[Heart]
Though I haven't tried it out yet, so I don't know if it actually takes your gold or something to- like the cost of inscribing yet, so.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'll test it out. So, uh, Lucent is Phineas, right? Lirian.

[(Finneas)]
Yes, Lirian is my character.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, do you want to rest since you've used up some spells?

[(Finneas)]
Or do you want to just- Fourth level spell and a first level spell, I could go. Uh, I haven't lost too much, but um- I wouldn't say no to a rest, but I don't think I need it.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And I think there's no reason to rest here for a night. I think we're all doing pretty good. Maybe a short rest if you want to get up some health.

[Referee (James)]
A rest isn't a bad idea. Encounters are a little bit more common in places like this.

[Heart]
Uh, I guess we could rest on the way if we find somewhere else, that's nice. I'm back. But short rest is- Hello!

Short rest is a good idea.

[Referee (James)]
So weird.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I want to roll them individually.

[(Frogitha)]
Is this the same day as, uh, yesterday?

[Referee (James)]
So, I- Yes, because you guys are in a different plane of existence.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay. So yeah, that's why I was asking if we camped here. So what is this realm called?

Is this, like, cloud world?

[Referee (James)]
What is this realm called? Which realm?

[(Frogitha)]
The realm, whatever this cloud place is.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, realm, uh, the Aether.

[(Frogitha)]
The Aether, okay. You missed a chance to call it the Cloud District.

[Referee (James)]
Cloud District, yeah. They will be very- They will be very insistent that you do not call it the Aether. It's only the Aether.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, we had to get some glowstone in a water bucket.

[Speaker 11]
Yes. Exactly. Like, classic.

So we're saying short rest? Yes.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, I think I have something for short rest if we're needing it. Let me check it.

[(Finneas)]
Any bonus healing?

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, I have- Ooh, Song of Rest? Yeah, Song of Rest. Which is in D8.

[Speaker 8]
Nice. Ooh. Wait, hang on.

Who's rolling ballistas? James.

[(Finneas)]
Ah. It says Game Master. How does Song of Rest work?

[Heart]
Um, you get- You roll the D8 and then that's the rest. What- I roll the D8 or I do. I believe you roll the D8.

Let's see.

[(Frogitha)]
You can use Soothing Music to help- No, no.

[Heart]
We reroll it. You're right. I don't need any, so.

[(Finneas)]
Wait, is that one D8 per hit die that we spend or total for the rest?

[(Frogitha)]
I think it's just- I think it's just- And I'm back to full! Nice.

[Heart]
Oh, Paros rolled max.

[(Frogitha)]
Regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more hit die. Each of those creatures regains an extra 1D8 hit points.

[Heart]
Larian, do you want- I wish I could give you some of mine.

[Baar-Ur]
Do we have some blood health potions? Or are those reserved for a Sleeping Beauty?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Nessie had them. Sleeping Beauty doesn't need them, so I imagine Nessie would give you some. Assuming you haven't run out of hit die.

[Heart]
Are your hit die all good? Or do you need a potion?

[Baar-Ur]
I'm good. I rolled hit die last session. I'm six away from max.

I was asking for Larian.

[Heart]
No, I was asking Larian.

[(Finneas)]
I don't want to use the healing items during the rest if they're not rechargeable. I'm down one hit as it currently stands and I have eight more hit die I can spend. So I'm feeling pretty good.

I'm gonna arcane recover and actually get all my spell slots back too. Because I get five levels and one level four slot and one level one slot adds up to five.

[Speaker 9]
Hello, hello.

[Speaker 8]
We're taking a short rest.

[Heart]
So if you have anything that requires- that reloads in a short rest, you can re-vamp it. If you want to expend any of your hit die, you can.

[Speaker 9]
I expend nuclear hit dice.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Heart]
I like to imagine as we're busy fighting the Tempest, now that we've left all our hirelings at the dock, they're having the time of their lives, you know?

[Baar-Ur]
Just partying it up.

[Heart]
Exactly. They're just like, cool, we're now in active danger. We can have fun here.

One of them has at least lost ten gold in some card game.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, Shygard. Hold up.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, so is everybody rested up? We're ready to go?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, are you guys ready to go?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Referee (James)]
All right then. I guess you guys are going to approach... You guys are going to approach Black Roost Isle.

Short while up later.

[Speaker 10]
Oh boy.

[Referee (James)]
In the distance, you can see a black spot that appears behind every single cloud that passes between you and it. The cloud itself is darkened. Whenever a new cloud passes by, there's always a spot that is dark, no matter where it's moving.

That helps direct you to the location. While the area outside is relatively calm, the orange current that you've been following to get to this place begins taking on black streaks throughout it. These little black whisks that just flow through.

You guys eventually come to an area that is almost completely clear of cloud cover, with a few very small exceptions that are about the size of a large creature. It is an island nearly completely shrouded in darkness. You can just barely see the outline or the silhouette of this island with a thin gray glow.

Greenish gray glow that seems to outline the rest of its silhouette, telling you where it is. It's hard on the eyes. It's unpleasant to look at.

And you hear a few shrieks that seem to howl and penetrate even over the wind in this area. Because it has noticed you.

[Baar-Ur]
What has noticed us?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, what does it do?

[Baar-Ur]
Oh. I wave at it.

[Referee (James)]
That's fun. Indeed.

[Baar-Ur]
Sure that's not going to be a problem at all. Of course not. No, sir.

[Referee (James)]
So I'm going to do two things here just to just to cover your approach.

[(Frogitha)]
Glowing circles. Oh goody. Which circle of doom are we plopping our people in?

[Referee (James)]
None of them. I'm going to set down a not circle of doom on the left hand side. Circle of non-doom.

A doomless circle.

[(Frogitha)]
That's where we put ourselves?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, oh, why did I make this so long? It's a drag too.

[(Frogitha)]
So I can't really see anything.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you're not going to be able to see anything there, which is being intentional because right now you guys aren't actually on the island. You guys are going to be adding yourselves to the initiative. Oh.

[Heart]
Is it one person again or everyone?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, I'm fine with that. Yeah, we're going to do one person.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So James. It's going to say yes or no. Oh, Nessie just got home.

Um, so she'll be in here in a spew. Um, I also was going to have a question of um, so Perra was riding with Mimosa.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So would she still be like riding with Mimosa on the thing?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, well, especially if Mimosa is going to be here then.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Make this a lot easier.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Because I was going to ask how movement worked with that. Oh, I guess you could each move the carpet. Well, when she gets here, she controls it.

Um, also, I think you are having some echoes. Oh dear. Okay, one sec.

Is that me? No, it was Han.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, just sometimes this is- So can you hear yourself or am I- I have been hearing myself through you.

[Heart]
Okay, yeah, that's me then.

[Referee (James)]
One second. It's only while you're both talking or both making a little bit of noise once the mic picks up a little bit.

[Heart]
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 10]
Perfect.

[Referee (James)]
The first thing that you guys are in combat is going to be a small violet fungus that gets flung from the colony from out of the darkness like right at one of your heads. Let's say this goes to... It's gonna go to Lirian.

[Speaker 8]
Gnome flinger?

[Heart]
Who did you say it was going to?

[Referee (James)]
Lirian.

[Heart]
Lirian.

[Speaker 10]
Yay, nice to hear it. Hiya. I didn't have to worry about it.

Hello.

[(Nessie)]
Hello.

[(Finneas)]
What's to me?

[Referee (James)]
Violet fungus is getting flung in your direction.

[(Nessie)]
Gross. Press the digitation.

[Referee (James)]
Why are so many disapprovals, Nessie?

[(Nessie)]
Because I tried to freaking exit out of it, but there's no way to dismiss it. I hate it.

[Referee (James)]
Do you want this to hit you or your mouth?

[(Finneas)]
Me.

[Referee (James)]
All right, you take...

[(Finneas)]
Has a silvery barbs available?

[Referee (James)]
Gonna be able to see the attacking creature and within range.

[(Finneas)]
We don't see them. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
So right now you guys have a few options here. You can attempt to push each time you push or each time a person pushes, they're going to get attacked by one of these siege engines on the... They're gonna get attacked by one of these siege engines.

It's being controlled by something on the island. You can attempt to dodge, which is going to be a little bit... It's going to take you a little bit longer to get to the island itself.

Or you can attempt to... And it's going to provoke an attack, but at disadvantage. Or you could attempt to hide between some of these little cloud areas, which allows you to push a little bit more slowly, but without getting attacked.

You're successful. And I'm gonna have one of you choose initiative.

[(Finneas)]
I have a question about greater invisibility. It says, You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.

Is my mount carrying me?

[Speaker 9]
That seems reasonable.

[(Finneas)]
So if I cast greater invis on my mount, it should invis me and my hireling, Francis, as long as we're on the mount. Okay. I guess my inclination is to try to push forward slowly so that we don't draw fire.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, is it group or is it individual?

[Referee (James)]
Wait, no, no. For something like this, no. Let's do an individual initiative.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
If you have something that lets you fire back, you're worse than ever for me. So which of you have sight in magical darkness?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I know I do.

[(Nessie)]
I think Mimosa does.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, from the pack magic?

[(Nessie)]
She also has something that lets her see invisible people 10 feet from her.

[Baar-Ur]
If we consider this to have been travel, then I could have taken whatever role it is that lets me share one of my packed features with people and given everybody my devil's sight.

[Referee (James)]
You guys did take a short rest. Go ahead.

[Baar-Ur]
I have to look that up in the exploration rules.

[(Nessie)]
Can I use my short rest to get some health back?

[Speaker 8]
Yes, because you didn't get the chance to short rest. Cool. All right, I'm back for good.

There we go. As cook, which is weird, but hey, who am I to be picky? Which you're viewing the meal.

[Speaker 9]
Let me roll.

[Baar-Ur]
And I'll add a crafter dice to that.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, cool. All right. What did you get?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I think... Can I have my familiar provide me with the help action on that so I can roll again as advantage?

[Speaker 10]
Sure.

[Baar-Ur]
There we go. 23. That's much better.

[Referee (James)]
Success. And how many people can you share that benefit?

[Baar-Ur]
I think it's the entire party. Warlock, cook. Each of your party can use one of my eldritch invocations.

[(Finneas)]
What exactly is the eldritch invocation?

[Baar-Ur]
I'm giving you all devil's sight, which is 120 feet of dark vision.

[Referee (James)]
So much fucking news here. Magical darkness is... Foundry VTT does not handle magical darkness well.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I'm not sure if it does or does not, because when I was hovering over it, it was letting me see through it.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, these are... That's not even like true magical darkness. I had to...

Like a dumb workaround. I had to figure it out. Okay, so I am going to drop these down.

So these are the... On the surface, you can see tendrils and vines manipulating these different siege engines. That's where the colony ballista comes from.

It's going to attack. Attack Corpus.

[Baar-Ur]
I wonder if this is some kind of awakened natural floating plant.

[Referee (James)]
There's 26 hits. Corpus.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, you know the answer to that.

[Referee (James)]
I want to see if he was actually here or not. He's not, so damage.

[(Frogitha)]
A druid would love this island.

[Referee (James)]
Druids actually hate these islands. They fucking hate them. All right, Mimosa.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
You missed it, by the way. So you guys can either push, which is going to provoke more attacks, or it's going to... If you push, it provokes more attacks.

If you dodge, it's going to... It still provokes it and move forward, then it still provokes an attack, but obviously you can... It's less likely to hit, and if you attempt to hide behind one of the few sparse smaller clouds that are nearby, then you get to avoid ticking any kind of bits.

But since you can see the island, you also do have the option of, if you have something that works on it, attacking some of these siege engines.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, are we going this way, or are we just Theater of the Mind attacking those guys?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, right now this is Theater of the Mind, because you guys are flying.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, okay. Oh, that's right. We're in the air?

[Referee (James)]
Indeed.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. Well, Kara and I are going to attempt to hide behind a cloud, because I assume she's on my magic carpet.

[Speaker 10]
Mm-hmm.

[(Nessie)]
So, don't move, don't breathe, Para, okay? And no one...

[Referee (James)]
She can still attack. If she's attacking from me, that will be more effective, because it's just...

[(Nessie)]
I'm just saying she's shit at stealth.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't think I've rolled a stealth above a 10 this entire campaign. They literally can't see that.

[(Nessie)]
We always have to help her.

[Referee (James)]
Less stuff tricks.

[(Nessie)]
Um...

[Referee (James)]
Well, that was your bonus action, I guess. Anything with your action?

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I... Is this where the animal is that we're trying to get?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, so we can't exactly set it on fire.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Quietly closes, create bonfire.

[Speaker 8]
I know! What are you thinking of doing?

[(Nessie)]
I mean, technically, I was thinking of setting the ballistas on fire, or whatever, if they're made out of wood, or...

[(Frogitha)]
We do have to burn away the darkness.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, okay. If there's a way that I can set something on fire without it... If we can get ahead of the fire, then we can save the people before the...

[(Frogitha)]
Well, do we even have to burn away the darkness if we can see through it? With the magical eyesight? Oh, okay.

So we are just one with the darkness now.

[Referee (James)]
No, that's as if that cave is a lot easier to run now.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, my thought is to start a fire at the first one that I can sneak up to.

[Referee (James)]
If it's flammable. You're not at the island yet. You're still in the air.

[Speaker 10]
So if you have something that you've arranged...

[Speaker 8]
How far away from...

[Referee (James)]
The group would have started 150 feet away.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. Um, I... Can I stealth my way up closer then?

[Referee (James)]
You could stealth. Yeah, you could do like a second stealth action.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, so I'll have a stealth 35 feet the first time, and then 35 more feet. So a total of 70. So I'm going to roll another stealth.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, go ahead.

[Referee (James)]
No, I still can't make that. But five walkers and then five more stealths. All right, so you're 70 feet.

So I'm going to set your total to 80. I think that makes you practical. Cool.

Okay.

[(Nessie)]
All right, that's my turn then.

[Referee (James)]
There's another gnome flinger. It is waiting for somebody to push, so it will hold its action.

[(Frogitha)]
Can I be able to see anything from my position? Or is darkness...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You guys have devil sight, so you can see through the darkness.

[Referee (James)]
You all have devil sight, so you can see through the darkness.

[(Frogitha)]
So I need to... I mean, like, map-wise. Should I see anything on the map?

[Referee (James)]
No, don't worry about it right now. Don't worry, you guys are in the theater of the mind.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, all right.

[(Finneas)]
Um, what do we... Do we think that these plants... Like, I'm wondering if invisibility is going to help me against the plants.

Or if they have some other method of sensing that, uh, you know, vibrations in the air or something.

[Heart]
I think it will help you with pushing, since they can't see you. So if you just...

[Speaker 11]
Okay, 18.

[Baar-Ur]
Sorry, that wasn't a commentary on your roll. I dropped my spool of thread.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, I was just... I couldn't remember if we had a druid or something that might want to make a nature check to figure it out. I mean, I can obviously just...

Uh, cast the spell and cross my fingers, but...

[Referee (James)]
They said blood blight... You're aware of blood blight colonies. Pastas composed of far more leaves and other thin vegetation than other blood blights.

They take flight on usually gargantuan wings and look vaguely like stingrays or moths when viewed from below. And they have a large number of tendrils that flow downwards to claim prey and assist in movement when not flying. But in this case, this one is like she's itself with an island.

They do have... They have a large number of tentacles. They're typically immune to poison damage.

And they're typically... Sorry, they're resistant to poison and necrotic damage except from the spells of druids. They do have true sight within 60 feet.

[(Finneas)]
I see. All right.

[Heart]
Currently we're 150 feet.

[(Finneas)]
How close are these things to me?

[Referee (James)]
BRB. You are 150 feet away. I've indicated it on your...

[(Finneas)]
I see, the plus 150.

[Referee (James)]
I'll have to keep answering that.

[(Finneas)]
That's not above the ground, it's from the enemies. Yeah, it's from the enemies.

[Referee (James)]
The countdown is against me closer.

[(Finneas)]
I guess I'll cast Greater Invisibility, pass the concentration off to Francis, and then push forward.

[Referee (James)]
That's good.

[(Finneas)]
Cast it on my mount specifically. Right.

[Referee (James)]
You and Francis will also go invisible. It'll be clear the colony is not the ballistae itself. So it will be able to see you.

It will be able to direct attacks to you, but those will still be a disadvantage because the critters, the entity, the creature that is this ballista, this siege engine, whatever, is not going to actually be able to see you.

[(Finneas)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
And how much closer do you move?

[(Finneas)]
Uh, my full movement speed, uh, 30 feet. That's for whatever mount. Uh, okay, Griffin, let's see.

[Referee (James)]
Can you create a new actor and then import Griffin from Plutonium?

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, yeah, 30, uh, fly 80 feet, 80 feet forward.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. The gnome flinger is going to make a shot at your mount here.

[(Finneas)]
I'm trying to hit a 12.

[Referee (James)]
What the fuck? Okay, so you moved 80 feet. Go ahead and change your thing.

Wait, no, I got that. Total of 24 damage.

[(Finneas)]
Okay, 35 hit points left.

[Referee (James)]
It's turn that brings us to the colony ballista, which is going to wait for someone to bush. That brings us to Tyrona. Tyrona, you might be muted.

[Baar-Ur]
I am, sorry. Um, I think I'm flying with Corpus, if I remember correctly.

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Baar-Ur]
Are we flying at Griffin also?

[Speaker 9]
Now that I don't remember.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You guys are on the Glitter, Glitter, Glitter, Glitter, Glitter. The Glittery Glit. Glitter Wavern.

Yeah. With, uh, Charis.

[Baar-Ur]
Sir Charis. Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It is Charis, but you're on Charis's, um, mount because it's large.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, there's three people on my mount because I'm small.

[Baar-Ur]
Weight is negligible. Um, I have a question first. Um, does this island count as a single creature?

[Referee (James)]
The colony itself does, is a creature. But things that are firing at you right now are separate creatures. So, yes and.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, you're probably going to tell me try it and find out, but would casting polymorph on it work?

[Referee (James)]
Okay, what's the range on polymorph? It's 60 feet. 60 feet, so you get within range of the island and then you cast.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Do we want to do that while there's things inside?

[Referee (James)]
Well, it's not the entire island, like there's the regular island and then there is the creature that is the colony. And then there are other plant creatures that are created by this one. So it will, it will remove one problem for you.

And it would work. Okay.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, um, then I am going to hold my action to cast a spell.

[Referee (James)]
How far away are we from the island? I'm going to kill you.

[(Nessie)]
One hundred and fifty feet.

[Referee (James)]
You start 150 feet.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, that's, don't give, that's stupid. The 150 feet is from the catapults. That was explicit.

[Speaker 10]
Yes.

[(Finneas)]
You just said that the, if I'm 150 feet away from them.

[Speaker 10]
No, you're not 150 feet.

[Referee (James)]
No, well, you not specifically because you move closer, right?

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, but that's 70 feet. If I'm 70 feet away, how did it see through my invisibility? It only has true sight to 20 feet.

[Referee (James)]
No, you're right. Because it can't direct it. Go ahead and take that damage off.

Because you said you moved your full movement and I completely miscounted that. I'm sorry I did not catch that earlier.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, no sweat.

[Referee (James)]
But the movement that is your distance from the island is listed above your character. So Kairone, if you want to cast, if you want to cast Polymorph on this thing, you have to get closer to it.

[Baar-Ur]
Yes, I am going to tell Karras. Yep, what's up? I can, I can never remember if it's Karras or Saris.

I'm going to tell Karras, get me within, wait, hang on. I have spell sniper. Is this range going to be 60 or 120?

Let me double check. Oh, range is 120 on it. So I'm going to tell her, I need you in 30 feet closer and I can neutralize this thing at least for a little while.

And then hold my action to cast a spell, which means I get to make a weapon attack. Which probably won't do an awful lot right now. Um, but you know, better than nothing.

[(Finneas)]
Polymorph doesn't require you to make a weapon attack, so I don't think its range would be extended.

[Referee (James)]
You spell snipers for things that do a weapon attack.

[Baar-Ur]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
All right, I need to move this along. So I would let you continue deciding, but Karras, you're on.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh no, I've already decided.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Baar-Ur]
I'm just trying to throw out an Eldritch Blast.

[Referee (James)]
And which one are you throwing that at?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, just, I don't know, the closest ballista. All right. Are those it?

Here we go. All right, that's me.

[Referee (James)]
An unhappy ballista. Brings us to Karras.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, describe the scene for me just slightly. I need to know who I can attack.

[Referee (James)]
You can see a few different... All right, in the darkness there are a bunch of plant-controlled siege engines that are currently firing on you guys. They are loading up and they're waiting for you to approach before they fire.

So when you approach, one of the ones that's waiting is going to fire at you. You also have the option of attempting to hide. If you get your mount to successfully hide, that applies to everybody.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, I'll do that then, because I have this.

[Referee (James)]
You also have the mount dodge, which inflicts disadvantage on attacks.

[(Frogitha)]
All attacks based on sight made against the Glitter Wyvern have disadvantage. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[(Frogitha)]
Have disadvantage. Do I just roll a stealth for him?

[Referee (James)]
You roll a stealth because you're the one controlling the mount.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, I roll the stealth. Perfect.

[Speaker 10]
In this case.

[(Frogitha)]
Even better. 16? Um...

[Speaker 11]
It has to roll a...

[Referee (James)]
It did not.

[(Frogitha)]
All right. So can I... Yeah, I can attack in addition, right?

[Referee (James)]
That would have been... So that would have been your action. Unless you have something to...

Some way to do it with the bonus action, which I think you do.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, because I have cunning action. All right. I will get closer and...

Well, am I able to at least get to like a 50-foot range of something? How far can the Glitter Wyvern go? Can go...

[Referee (James)]
Let's see. Fly speed is 60 feet. 60 feet.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, so no. I'll get close enough and then see if I can do my breath attack. Nope, okay.

20 feet.

[Referee (James)]
So if you're moving... If you're hiding within 60 feet, you're gonna get... Everybody on the Glitter Wyvern is gonna be...

I need to go away. But I need people to move these along a little bit faster.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, then I will just shoot. Because I think I can do that. And if not...

Oh well.

[Referee (James)]
18.

[(Frogitha)]
18. Who are you attacking? Uh, whatever wants to shoot at me the most.

Come on. Uh... That thing.

The Colony Ballista.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's multiple.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay. Just double right click it. Oh, okay.

Hold on.

[Baar-Ur]
Let me adjust my vision. Shoot at the same one I shot at.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, she... Yeah, that's fine.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, right! Because you guys don't have vision. Yeah.

[(Frogitha)]
I'm gonna give myself a 80 foot vision, I guess.

[Referee (James)]
But go ahead and roll damage. I will apply it to...

[(Frogitha)]
There we go. Damage. All right.

And that's my go.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
It's not looking so hot. That brings us to...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, Kyrona is within close range, so...

[Baar-Ur]
Yep, that brings us back to me. Because I am in ranged cast polymorph.

[Referee (James)]
What did I get on that d20?

[Speaker 10]
13.

[Referee (James)]
And that's definitely not... Yes. Okay, that's a failure.

So, no more. You see, not all the vegetation, but a lot of the vegetation just kind of... Like, disappears into the island.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, yeah.

[Baar-Ur]
What'd you pick? Um, I'll just turn it into a sparrow. Oh.

I don't want to risk that it's going to fall out of the sky and onto something and turn back into something. So, I want it to be able to fly, but, you know, not really deal damage.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
One of us is going to get pecked up. Okay, so these things are still, like, active, right?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, they are still active.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay. I would like to blast... Oh, shit.

Blast them.

[Referee (James)]
Okay!

[Heart]
I think that's more than just blasting them, but...

[Referee (James)]
Hey, don't undo my polymorph.

[Speaker 8]
Amazing.

[Referee (James)]
It's not going to, because the sparrow, it retracted deeper into the island, which is what I was thinking about earlier.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. So, let's see.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It was 40 damage.

[Referee (James)]
Two colony cannon. No, the tokens are not selected, dammit. But they were, which is like a two colony cannon, so...

Oh, so if I select them, very cool.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, that's always so fun to watch.

[Referee (James)]
And these two take...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That does also make the ones that have lived and failed, they are blinded. If that does anything to them.

[Referee (James)]
It does, because they no longer have their true sight. But if it's...

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, at this point... Oh, wait, there's still the two colony cannons, but besides those two, if these targets are still blinded while those two colony cannons are dead, then you guys, I will just let you guys land on the island, because they're not going to be able to... They're randomly guessing directions out of a 3D space, and that's not going to work out.

They're not going to actually be able to threaten you guys. What does that blindness last until? It's a minute.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
One minute.

[(Finneas)]
And I can just cast it again. Very nice.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alrighty, that's my go, though. I don't think I have anything on a bonus action I can do.

[Referee (James)]
This one is no longer blinded. Let's see. Fucking scream!

Keeps double right-clicking. Okay, that thing is no longer blinded. That is a CERN...

Corpus! Got smacked by a pelican, really.

[Speaker 9]
That felt absolutely wonderful. Okay, so what are my options?

[Referee (James)]
Well, your options... The mount has already moved. Do you have a ranged attack that could apply to these things?

[Speaker 9]
Let me check my bag.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, I'll be waiting on that. Dr. Basio?

[Heart]
I think all the other things are blind. And I'll cast Great Invisibility on myself and do a push. It's like...

No. Yeah, Greater Invisibility and do a push.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. What is your mount's flight speed?

[Speaker 10]
Fifteen.

[Speaker 9]
I mean, that's pretty much all I can do right there.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, and what are you targeting? You see the... I can't...

There we go. Okay, cool. That is...

Not bad. So I have the colony cannons, which are both going to be for a push. Let me see.

I'm going to pop out. Do some burst so I can make saves again. Failed.

That is its turn. Makes it.

[Speaker 10]
Blinded.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, now did it roll twice? I know. Okay, so I went to a second...

I went to a different round instead of the next turn. Okay, so the colony... There's the mount.

And the colony takes a beat.

[Speaker 10]
There we go.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, Mimosa. Your turn.

[(Nessie)]
Um, okay, so are we individually attacking?

[Referee (James)]
Yep, if you guys manage to clear out... If there are... If the only siege engines that are left are blinded, then you guys are going to be able to land safely on the island.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, the damage are disabled.

[Referee (James)]
The remaining ones that don't have the little mark on their heads.

[(Finneas)]
That's the priority.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, we're 80 feet. Um, I don't have anything farming. I guess I have Eldritch Blast.

Hang on, I have to do math. Um, my family just came home, which is why.

[Referee (James)]
All right, do you want us to give you a moment?

[(Nessie)]
Um, I want to do Cloud of Daggers, if...

[Referee (James)]
Yes. Well, you can pick any two targets that you would like to catch in this round.

[(Nessie)]
Um, this one and this one.

[Referee (James)]
That's good, go ahead and cast. How many daggers do you have now?

[(Nessie)]
I have six.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Heart]
You do have something that can grab them for you? Yes.

[Referee (James)]
No, the point is that the Cloud of Daggers spell increases its damage. The thing that increases Mimosa's damage with other daggers also increases the damage for Cloud of Daggers.

[Speaker 10]
Ooh, okay.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I need to remember to use it more.

[Referee (James)]
I think it is. I think that's 10d4.

[Speaker 9]
Wrong.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, so... Yeah, it looks like it... Yep.

[Referee (James)]
That's doing great over there. All right, anything with your bonus action? Are you moving the carpet?

[(Nessie)]
Uh, Perry, do you want me to move closer?

[Speaker 8]
Yes, well...

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, probably smart. Okay. Um...

[Referee (James)]
Are you doing that stealthily or unstealthily?

[(Nessie)]
Ooh, stealthily. Let me roll for you.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you're good.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I'll move 30 feet, 35 feet. My thing can only go 30 feet, I forgot about that.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Go ahead and change that little marker above you that says... Go ahead and decrease the marker by about 30 feet for you and Para.

This thing has to make a pound save. Oh, okay, I feel pretty good about that. It's no longer blinded.

And keep in mind, the ones that are no longer blinded, that took their whole turn. Yep, they haven't done anything. They can't even, like, hold their action.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's what I was thinking, because I thought...

[(Finneas)]
How many of these can I get in a single fireball?

[Referee (James)]
I get three.

[(Finneas)]
You can get three? Okay, yeah, level five fireball.

[Speaker 10]
All righty.

[Referee (James)]
The colony cannon and the gnome flinger from earlier, those two are close to each other.

[(Finneas)]
It gave me the overlay, so I just put the overlay down. You can pick whichever three would be the closest to each other.

[Referee (James)]
Two cannons. All right, all failed.

[Speaker 10]
Boom.

[(Finneas)]
Sorry, I forgot I had a roll to play there. And then Francis is going to cast a fireball as well.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, Francis may pick another three. Okay, let's see. There we go, much better.

[(Finneas)]
And then push forward until I'm... I'll close in with one.

[Referee (James)]
All right, I think there's one colony cannon that was actually able to hold its action last turn. The only two things that were not blinded were colony cannons.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, I'll go close enough that it'll definitely... Like, I'm 70 feet away, I have 80 feet of movement. I'll get right next to it.

[Referee (James)]
Aren't you invisible? That's right.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, but they have two sight at 20 feet. No, no, no, only the colony has it.

[Referee (James)]
So, and it can only direct them to the proper place. So, it can't even fire on you or Dr. Bastia. You're good.

[(Finneas)]
All right, my turn.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I mean, right, what am I doing? Um, if you want to skip me and go to the next person, I was distracted, so...

[Referee (James)]
No worries, Karis, you're controlling the Glitter Wyvern anyways. What would you like to do?

[(Frogitha)]
All right, um, I'm gonna use my breath weapon. What does that do? Hold on, let me put my, let me put my little dude on the screen here.

Um, what is this? Um, all right, now I need a cone. Um, can we just pretend that the cone reaches these guys?

[Referee (James)]
They need to add five to... Well, you need to add your charisma modifier to... Those.

They're sorry to, um, I would say that to Kyrona. He said dexterity saves from...

[(Frogitha)]
Because I don't feel like putting a cone on the screen. They're too unruly. Totally not, because I have no idea how to do it.

[(Finneas)]
Of course, that couldn't be it. That would mean you're stupid.

[(Frogitha)]
Exactly.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so what was the TC 15? Okay, so all three of them failed. I'm gonna apply the squeaked condition.

[(Frogitha)]
All attacks against glitter-covered creatures are made with advantage. And I guess that's my turn, because it doesn't actually say if it's an action or a bonus action, so I'll just say that's my turn.

[Referee (James)]
So, fine. I'm going to have the colony cannon, because he moved up, and I'm going to have it make an attack against you.

[(Frogitha)]
That's fair. Me or the dragon.

[Referee (James)]
Or wyvern. Let's get thrown into this and do it against you. These guys aren't familiar with the mounts as much yet.

Okay, uh, five, two, hit.

[(Frogitha)]
Absolutely diabolical, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
You take a lot of damage. This is cannonball.

[(Frogitha)]
It's not good. I don't like that. I do not like that at all.

That hurts. I am a tiny fairy.

[Referee (James)]
Just, like, a flak round basically detonates midair. It just pelts you with a bunch of fragments. It's very difficult.

Like, you really struggle with getting the glitter wyvern to actually move out of the way. It just kind of shreds your arm. And that's when you realize that these cannonballs were sourced from Batstow, New Jersey.

The stilket-rich bog iron was ideal for frangible rounds. Okay.

[(Finneas)]
That does a bad spray on tan as well.

[Referee (James)]
Yes.

[Baar-Ur]
Sorry, I'm tagging back in. I updated my eldritch blast damage.

[Referee (James)]
Very good. Damage.

[(Finneas)]
Plus 2d4 plus 1d6.

[Baar-Ur]
Damn!

[Speaker 10]
Yes.

[Baar-Ur]
The 1d6 is from my familiar slash companion. One of the d4s is from... Fae Wanderer.

And the other one I think is also from my... No, that's from favored foe.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Sick! And who are we smacking with those?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I'm just going to continue to keep it simple. Whichever ballista or gnome flinger is closest.

[Speaker 10]
All right.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you for your patience. You are fine. Nearly dead.

Brings us to Pera.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Get donned.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, this is likely the end of them. Uh, that one's going to die no matter if it saves. That one will...

die regardless of whether it saves.

[Heart]
Praise the sun!

[Referee (James)]
Will die regardless of whether it saves. Uh, this one will not die... regardless of whether it saves.

However, it will... will certainly die at a certain rank star.

[Speaker 8]
Okay! Yep, that was me.

[Referee (James)]
Brings us to Corpus. All right. What target left on the board?

[Speaker 9]
I can't fuck this up. Don't sell yourself short.

[Referee (James)]
Targeted? Let's move this out. Targeted?

[Speaker 9]
So you can apply the damage easily.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, Corpus, you're on the same... uh... flight as I am.

That means, I believe...

[Referee (James)]
Because you guys are all significantly closer. By 30 feet.

[Baar-Ur]
Corpus, you also get 1d6.

[Speaker 9]
Damage?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, well. Don't worry. Extra point.

Since you guys are out of initiative, this will kill you there.

[Baar-Ur]
Yippee! See, that one point did make a difference.

[(Finneas)]
Easy squeezy.

[Baar-Ur]
Great.

[(Finneas)]
Man, James's dice wanted to kill me there! Rolled a 20, a 20, an 18. That was...

[Referee (James)]
Remember, you can apply the invisible condition to yourself.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, how do I do that? I tried doing it to the character tree, and it wouldn't let me switch...

[Referee (James)]
You right-click the character token.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, assign status effect. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, that makes it a lot easier. Okay, so you guys come into a... I can wait to equip a weapon.

You guys come into a hole, the only hole in the island here. The most obvious hole in the island here. Yes, there you go.

How long does greater invisibility last for? Whole hour, I believe? I...

Let me double-check, actually. Could be wrong on that one. It's either 1 minute or 10 minutes.

I can't remember which.

[Heart]
Okay. Greater invisibility... That's for a minute.

[Referee (James)]
All right, there's some heated water ahead.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, when we land, Hera's gonna heal everyone.

[Speaker 8]
Um, yeah, I'll do here. I'll get 55.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think I have enough range for that. Or six creatures? Yeah.

One person would not be able to take any, which will be me, because I am full.

[Heart]
I was going to say, oh, I'm fine, so you could just leave me out, but all right.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, well, if one of the mounts needs any healing, I guess they can take that.

[Speaker 11]
Yes, the griffon does.

[Heart]
Then the griffon should be full, I think.

[Speaker 9]
Corpus can top up.

[(Frogitha)]
Mask your wounds, perfect. I'm back up all the way. Thank you for that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I can't actually see Lyrian, so I don't actually know how far he got down.

[(Finneas)]
Uh, I was down, like, 39, so that was a good chunk. Okay, so that's 55 topped you up.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, we're on the ground.

[(Finneas)]
We're now...

[Speaker 11]
The map is now accurate? Yes.

[Baar-Ur]
The map is totally black for me.

[Heart]
You might want to expand your vision on your token.

[Referee (James)]
Set your vision to vision mode. You want to set it to...

[Baar-Ur]
I don't know why it does that. Okay.

[(Frogitha)]
Dark vision. How far should I be able to see?

[Speaker 8]
120 because of the...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, what does the party wish to do? Begin moving forward. Do it in 30-foot increments as a group.

Unless, of course, you're staying behind.

[(Finneas)]
Do we want to have the marching order? We have a barbarian here, don't we?

[(Frogitha)]
Oh, this guy? There's guys over there. That is Glimmer.

My... Oh, okay. He's a...

Yeah, he's a... Wyvern? Wyvern?

Yeah, one of those two.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's some blocks of cheese over there.

[(Frogitha)]
Type token...

[(Finneas)]
This is Romulus! My majestic mount.

[(Frogitha)]
Romulus. Wonderful.

[Speaker 9]
I see two tofu-looking thingies.

[(Finneas)]
Okay. Do we want a marching order? And the two...

The terrain here... Are we cutting through the jungle? Do we have good visibility?

[Referee (James)]
That's pretty much what it is. Well, you have better visibility on account of this lovely, lovely pack magic you got going on. Straight from the girdle of Orion himself.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
From his girdle? I couldn't think of something.

[Speaker 8]
You wouldn't.

[(Nessie)]
Girdle if he wants to.

[(Finneas)]
Okay, yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Men wear girdles all the time.

[(Finneas)]
In front, less likely to be surprised. And then the high...

[Referee (James)]
From the fanny pack of Orion himself. Sorry, continue.

[(Finneas)]
And then blasters in the back. Okay, so Corpus is going to be on you. You're the leader, unless anyone has a particular inclination to what directions to explore first.

Because they'd be just empowered.

[Speaker 9]
March to the front, but can someone else act as the party face? Because I'm eating. Uh, sure.

And you do not want to hear lip-smacking sounds. And they're pretty moving, so...

[Speaker 8]
Are there ways to stealth?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, there's like... It's all like tight corridors and caves here.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, Mimosa, I'm just... I'm going to stealth next to, or with, or ahead of the party. I don't know.

Well, yeah.

[Speaker 10]
All right, people have already moved. Are we...

[(Finneas)]
Like, people moved into areas that I currently don't have vision into. Uh, no contact with enemies thus far. So I guess we just keep going.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I will cast Cast Without a Trace. Um, stay within 30 feet of me and you get a plus 10 bonus. Yeah, I can't...

[(Finneas)]
Corpus, move your ship. I can't move your token. I don't have ownership.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I guess we can always stealth. Let's see what I get.

[Heart]
Do Lirion and I still have the advantage from greater invisibility, or has it worn off by now?

[Referee (James)]
Well, over one minute.

[Speaker 10]
Okie dokie.

[(Finneas)]
Uh, a situational bonus of 10, is that right?

[Speaker 10]
Yep.

[Speaker 11]
What's their perception?

[(Frogitha)]
Probably like 25. Something stupid like that.

[Speaker 8]
Minus two.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Hera has been detected.

[Heart]
Hang on. I have, uh, we're in distance, so I could Silvery Barbs them. So I'm going to do that.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, we're going to have to fight them anyway.

[Heart]
But don't you want to sneak past them?

[Referee (James)]
All right, so Dr. Basio will also... Do you have anything to avoid this? Oh, let's see.

[Speaker 8]
Avoid...

[Referee (James)]
I cast it. Okay. The Dr. Basio you've seen instead.

[Heart]
Ah, dang nabbits.

[(Frogitha)]
Uh, what about my wyvern? Are they staying back, or are they coming with us? Are they too big to come with us?

Or can they fly over?

[Referee (James)]
You'd have to come with them. You'd have to come with them. It has to, like, squeeze.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay. We'll follow behind.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, so we can take to the air if needed. That's probably a good idea.

[Referee (James)]
Just briefly. Now, Kyrona, you could probably pass off concentration to your familiar on Polymorph. But I did want to let you...

Or I did want to remind you that...

[Baar-Ur]
Yes, I forgot that. I did forget. I remember that Polymorphous Concentration is passed without a Trace Concentration.

[Referee (James)]
But in either case...

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, it is.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you could have... You could pass it off to your familiar. Pass off Concentration to your familiar.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, I'll pass off Concentration on the Pass Without a Trace, because that's just a little bit less important. All right, so, um, Dr. Batra has been seen.

[Heart]
Yes. Yes, because I forgot the whole spells require components.

[Referee (James)]
One of them is verbal.

[Heart]
See, you should think about being a sorcerer instead.

[Referee (James)]
And add yourselves to the initiative. So, apparently, this one's going to be group. This one is going to be group.

[(Nessie)]
Was I able to, like, hide and move around to get to a different place with these guys? Or are we all in one tunnel?

[Referee (James)]
You are in one tunnel. You'll be able to.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[(Finneas)]
I think we're wherever we put ourselves.

[Referee (James)]
For planting critters in the local area, I'm going to have... I'm going to give one a chance. It's going to be a one in six chance.

Incrementing for a new critter from one of the other rooms to enter the battle. I'm not sure.

[Heart]
I've got to take Subtle Spell when I get my ASI next time. Not a sorcerer, just Metamagic Adept.

[Referee (James)]
Um... This is going to bring us to Lirian to start off with, assuming everybody has added themselves to the initiative.

[(Finneas)]
What do I know about gelatinous cubes? Can I arcana check?

[Referee (James)]
Sure. Based off the hit YouTuber GelatinousRube. They're supposed to come with cowboy hats and firearms, but these appear to be devoid of both.

I can't seem to recall any other information based off this misimpression.

[(Finneas)]
These are some strange variants of them.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Oh, Dr. Basik is in. Oh, we're all rolling?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, it's time for guessing. Okay. And Dr. Basik, you already cast Silvery Barbs. That doesn't mean you don't have a turn. But yeah, Lirian, anything that you wanted to do specifically?

[Speaker 11]
Let's see.

[(Finneas)]
Bonus action. Kick up a Bladesong, and then I will shoot at them, and then move forward and melee attack with a cantrip.

[Referee (James)]
Sounds good. Oh, surprising.

[(Finneas)]
Ooh, Nat 1. Not good. And I'll have my guy fire a bullet.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, give it the attack. There you go. He doesn't roll the attack.

He just, when somebody hits, he can... Okay, there we go. All right.

Here we go, Dr. Basik. And that's it. Anything for your action?

[Heart]
No. Uh, Lirian went first, but I will just... I will aim a fireball and hit it to the side.

Just so I... One second. Not cast.

Put it where Lirian is not.

[(Frogitha)]
Ooh, there's two of them.

[Referee (James)]
Indeed.

[Heart]
Okay, that will be my turn.

[(Frogitha)]
They may be charmed.

[Heart]
They are... I think they're mindless.

[Speaker 10]
Would you like to try that, Charis?

[(Frogitha)]
No, I think I'll think I won't waste any of my spell slots.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, is it my turn?

[Speaker 10]
It is.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay. All right. Um, I can always shoot them.

Yep, that hits. I'm gonna move so that I can be in range.

[Referee (James)]
He'll swap.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, I think I can get them from here.

[Referee (James)]
Integrates into a pile of acid.

[(Frogitha)]
I guess it didn't like my glitter bullet. Uh, oh, and my bonus action is next. Mimosa, you can have bardic inspiration.

[(Nessie)]
Ooh, yay! That's the one that lets me add a... Okay, cool.

[Referee (James)]
Brings us to Mimosa.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, I missed if any information was shared about how cubes work.

[(Finneas)]
They normally have hats. These ones don't. That's about all we got.

[Referee (James)]
Empty vulvars.

[(Finneas)]
That's both.

[Referee (James)]
I want to speak at the same time. I need to register.

[(Nessie)]
Speak?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, yes. All the time.

[Baar-Ur]
Constantly. Like the one right now.

[(Nessie)]
Are they voiced by the narrator?

[Referee (James)]
They're weird.

[(Nessie)]
Uh...

[Speaker 8]
I guess I'll go here. And... I'm gonna...

[Referee (James)]
Mimosa, go ahead and make me a perception check.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, I'm pretty good at those.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, you see...

[Referee (James)]
Another gelatinous cube.

[Speaker 10]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
Are these things actually...

[(Nessie)]
Um...

[Referee (James)]
You'll also see there are more, uh...

[(Nessie)]
I see a lot.

[Referee (James)]
There's more stuff back there. This block.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
There are more of the colony's digestive juices are present.

[(Nessie)]
Can also see up here. Um... All right, she'll call back.

I see a third gelatinous cube and more of those ballista thingies. Um... Well, I don't really think that changes what I wanted to do.

[Referee (James)]
It's your own deck, by the way. All right.

[(Nessie)]
Um... Ton of daggers is a cantrip, right?

[Referee (James)]
It's a spell. I think you get three of them per day.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. Doesn't tell me in the new sheet.

[Heart]
You know, if it's a spell that does damage, you can add your bardic inspiration to it. Since Charis is a glamour bard. Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Uh... Yeah, I'll just... Yeah, we'll just, um...

Blend this guy out.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, he takes damage.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
I think we're going to...

[Speaker 10]
Uh...

[Referee (James)]
No. Okay, Corpus.

[Speaker 9]
All right, use my fortify movement, walk over and hit the thing.

[Referee (James)]
Oh. Kill you.

[Speaker 9]
No, don't kill me. Oh, it charges. We're just gonna smack it.

These are reckless. Do any of those hit?

[Referee (James)]
Yes. It has an AC of six. Oh, well.

All right, that's my turn. Congratulations. Brings us next to...

Tyrona.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, um...

[Referee (James)]
If you're extra... You have not been spotted yet.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, um, correct my memory. I only can cast cantrips while concentrating?

[Referee (James)]
No, you just can't cast other spells that require concentration.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Fireballs, the counter volley, stuff like that. You can just bomb.

[Baar-Ur]
That was 15, I think. Oh, no, that does not give me health. All right, I'm gonna aim for the cube over here.

[Speaker 11]
Damage?

[Baar-Ur]
I'll just go with the default. All right, that's it for me.

[Referee (James)]
All right, very good, very good. Drop a shit ton of damage into a shambling mound. Begin dashing.

Gotta get up to Corpus. Go ahead and re-roll your... Actually, wait, no, you don't have to re-roll.

I'm just gonna apply the same damage again from cloud of daggers earlier to that shambling mound. It's slightly more mulched than it was previously. Para, you are still hidden.

Keep donkey.

[(Nessie)]
Um, this guy went in my daggers.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, I just applied 25 damage to him.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, sorry.

[Referee (James)]
He's getting re-mulched.

[(Nessie)]
Come into my blender.

[Referee (James)]
Blend? It's supposed to have 1575, so he should have only 50.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, geez.

[Referee (James)]
You took out a third of his hit points. What would you like to do, Para?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I would like to not sneeze again. I cast finger over your nose. I'm going to bazap him with a guiding bolt.

Can I do that from here? How far do you go? 120 feet, okay.

And do that one. Please. I miss.

[Referee (James)]
Unfortunate, just misses. Also, you do still have that silvery barbs was successful from earlier, by the way.

[Heart]
I can give you the advantage for that, yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So... Sure, I'll roll again. Kids?

Now he has... Everyone has advantage on him before he glow.

[Speaker 10]
And I'll move up.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And that'll be me.

[Referee (James)]
Oh. Close. Close.

All right, the gnome trigger.

[Speaker 11]
It's the closest thing nearby. Ah, this.

[Speaker 10]
It's likely.

[Referee (James)]
Ah, that's right. That's why it's not properly. It needs to...

Not now. It's going to miss. It flings a gray ooze to your position.

And that is... It's turn. We come now to Dr. Bastia. Dr. Bastia, are you muted?

[Heart]
That... Sorry, yes. Sorry.

Do we... Can we see where the colony gnome flinger is?

[Referee (James)]
Can you?

[Heart]
Not from there.

[(Nessie)]
Mimosa would have at least pointed out what direction they're in. But yeah, they're probably...

[Referee (James)]
Dr. Bastia can also not see Mimosa.

[(Nessie)]
I mean, she would have... Oh, she would have called out to the people where she saw stuff.

[Heart]
I'll move a bit so that... Oh, there are two of them. Okay.

I'm going to... Let's see. There are one, two, three things that we need to get rid of.

So... Where is my banishment? One, two, three.

This thing's almost dead, so I'll just cast a fifth level banishment to get rid of these. The colony ballista and the... The other one.

So this and this one.

[Referee (James)]
They are all banished.

[Heart]
Yippee, that will be my turn.

[(Finneas)]
What direction have we taken fire from? Are we all... Are we out of combat now?

[Referee (James)]
I will take you temporarily out of combat, because the dungeon is aware of your existence. However, it's made of plank critters.

[(Frogitha)]
I think they know we're here.

[Speaker 8]
No? Yes. I believe so, yes.

[Heart]
Well, I suppose all we can do is make haste.

[(Nessie)]
We can make haste. I can also go up ahead and be quiet and stealthy and see what's there. Or we can just figure it out together.

[Heart]
Do you want to go ahead? I mean, I wouldn't mind staying behind, but we wouldn't want you to get caught up in anything and not be able to get help.

[(Nessie)]
Um... I'm really stealthy and I can scream really loud. I also have this, and she points to her little...

The Santa hat she wears. She says, I can pass notes through it to you. Just make sure you have something...

Huh?

[Referee (James)]
That's right, you still have the Santa hat.

[Speaker 10]
I do!

[Referee (James)]
That's amazing. Magnificent.

[(Frogitha)]
I hate it when there's fighting going on and you just slip a... She's like, hey, fight.

[(Nessie)]
She's like, help! And horrible writing. But Apia's like, sorry for my terrible handwriting.

You just need to make sure that I can get something in exchange. So like, pick up a pebble or whatever. But I can go and scout.

[Heart]
I pick up a rock off the floor.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. It's so much better than being in your mind. I feel.

Okay.

[Speaker 8]
All right, I'm gonna stealth. Um, I'll stealth this way. I'm gonna move as far forward as I can.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, to keep her in the radius.

[Baar-Ur]
Yep. Oh, okay, so then that's...

[Referee (James)]
There's a pile of corpses to the left of you. Oh. Still plenty of vegetation around.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, does anything look hostile?

[Referee (James)]
Like, yeah. Nothing's attempting to attack you yet. It's pretty hard to distinguish plant friend from plant foe here because there's just a lot of plant.

All right. All right, I guess never mind.

[(Nessie)]
I'm not stealthing. We're all going together.

[Speaker 10]
Yes!

[Baar-Ur]
I wasn't gonna come any further until you said it was safe. Oh, Miranda, you're good. I'm talking about everybody else.

Oh.

[Speaker 10]
I'm still back here.

[Baar-Ur]
We're all just, like, tiptoeing on your heels.

[Speaker 9]
I'm following Mimosa.

[(Nessie)]
Stop! Dude! Damn it!

[Speaker 8]
You're supposed to stay behind. She's supposed to do the scouting.

[Speaker 9]
But, like, I'm sneaky.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 9]
Pass without trace, right? Oh, wait, I have to re-stealth.

[Referee (James)]
If you didn't...

[Baar-Ur]
James, can I take an ooze sample?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, you can. I'm gonna have you roll for that. While I roll some surprise attacks versus Corvus.

[(Nessie)]
I cannot be surprised. We cannot be surprised.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, none of you can be surprised.

[(Nessie)]
He's in... They're in dagger range, yeah. Okay.

Because I have my dagger of warding. Warning? Excuse me.

[Referee (James)]
Nobody else is moving up while this is happening. You guys get the fuck back there.

[Heart]
All right. Well, once this fight triggers...

[Referee (James)]
No, no, stop, stop, stop. Okay, Mimosa. No, no, no, no.

You guys roll initiative.

[Speaker 10]
That's a mechanical.

[(Frogitha)]
Just them roll initiative, or we all roll initiative?

[Referee (James)]
Just them.

[(Nessie)]
Just whoever he said.

[Referee (James)]
My roll delayed. So, Mimosa, you do... It's hidden, so you're not going to...

You're not going to be surprised, but you're not going to... You're going to be aware that something is, like, coming for you, I guess?

[(Nessie)]
This one or this guy?

[Speaker 10]
Like the...

[Referee (James)]
I guess the one on the right, because the corpse flower is not hidden. You'll be aware of that.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. I just get the EBGBs. All right, well...

I'll have my daggers ready.

[Referee (James)]
Corpus, you are... Did you see Mimosa? Take your daggers out.

[Speaker 11]
Corpus?

[Speaker 9]
Yes, it's not my turn.

[(Nessie)]
You have it on the corpse flower?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, I do have it on the corpse flower. Okay, Corpus, you see Mimosa, take your daggers.

[Speaker 9]
All right, and I see these shambling mounds. Oh, I don't see the shambling mounds.

[(Nessie)]
No, but Mimosa is aware something's not right beyond what she can see. So she's on high alert. That's all you see.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, these are invisible. I could see them for some reason. Um, well, I'll walk up to Mimosa.

And give her the help action. And then I'm going to use my bonus action. For...

Patient defense. So I'm dodging and helping.

[Referee (James)]
Back here, which is now visible to you. The mass of corpses on the side is going to collect itself. For this radius.

And if you'd like a mound of corpses and plant matter and fungi. It's not diseased, is it? And you're still free to move or continue moving if you wish.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, well now that I see it, I'm definitely just gonna start...

[Referee (James)]
pummeling it. The rest of you can net yourselves to initiative at this point.

[Speaker 9]
Let's make these with reckless. All right, flurry of blues. All right, that's my turn.

Why is it not targeted?

[Speaker 11]
Excuse me.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, Bar, you do not need to roll for it, by the way. Go ahead. Just fucking fly.

[Baar-Ur]
No, I already did. I got a 23.

[Referee (James)]
You're even better than me.

[Speaker 10]
Back.

[Referee (James)]
Awesome. Three damage. Second attack, which...

Wait, no, it has advantage. Reckless. Yes.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. All right.

[Referee (James)]
Make eight damage on top of that. And then it gets to use engulf.

[Speaker 9]
There's no saving throw against the grapple?

[Speaker 10]
Nope.

[Speaker 11]
All right. Attempt to... Let's see.

[Referee (James)]
You are simply engulfed. Okay. Last thing is the last.

This thing is hidden, so it's going to attack. But it doesn't get surprise on Mimosa. I'm going to attempt to constrict you.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, uh-oh. Do I have to make a constrict saving?

[Referee (James)]
You can use uncanny dodge on this. Oh, cool. Now, this is not going to be the full...

Don't immediately apply this damage because there's two separate damage things. You do take the bludgeoning damage now. Poison damage isn't until the start of your next turn.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, so I'm going to half this one?

[Referee (James)]
So you're going to have the bludgeoning damage.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
That's a 64? And then at the start of your... No.

It's only the 24. Oh. And the poison damage, you're going to have that.

[Speaker 10]
23.

[Referee (James)]
If you click on the constrict that says critical hit, it'll show you bludgeoning 24, poison 40.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay, so then half of the 24?

[Referee (James)]
Yep, so 12.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. On the next round, apologies for that. I don't know...

I really don't know how to resolve creatures being hidden without... I don't know how to resolve creatures being hidden... Unable...

Being unable to surprise you, but also being hidden besides just trying to be aware that there is a problem, but also you can't really do anything until they appear.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So the way Pathfinder does it is that if you roll initiative... When you roll your initiative, if you roll higher than them, you're aware of them. Because it's perception for initiative.

I like that. But here it's just separate, because there's no perception initiative.

[Referee (James)]
It's just initiative. It's just, yeah, a skill check. That's not a skill check.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
But it is a skill check. And then they would roll with stealth for their thing, and then, you know, that whole thing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's an elegant solution, I feel like, that I wish D&D had something similar for.

[Referee (James)]
That would be nice. Probably, if it comes up again, I'll probably use that. Kyrona, you are top of the round here.

[Baar-Ur]
What have I got that I can see? All right, Corpus is right there, looking like an idiot. Let's...

[Referee (James)]
You actually can't see him. Well, you would have seen him get engulfed by the corpses.

[Baar-Ur]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Right now, he's actually... Constitution modifier. Plus five, so he adds grounds to...

[Baar-Ur]
Is a Shambling Mound a creature?

[Referee (James)]
Sure is. The Undead Shambling Mound.

[Baar-Ur]
Charm. Question is, can it be charmed? Probably not, so I won't try and throw.

[Referee (James)]
Some charm effects are... Specifically call out that they're immune to... The undead are immune to it, but...

I don't think this has any...

[Baar-Ur]
I mean, it's... Like... I'm sure it could be fascinated by something shiny, for example.

[Referee (James)]
What are you thinking?

[Baar-Ur]
I'm thinking of casting Enthrall. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

[Baar-Ur]
All right.

[Referee (James)]
He's decision... All right. Wait, it's Corpus.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, wow. Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, so it has disadvantage to perceive any creature other than me.

[Referee (James)]
Right now, it's just kind of focused on him.

[Baar-Ur]
Yep. And it's not Concentration. Nope, it's not.

I think that's it. I don't think... I didn't hold my action, so I can't also do a weapon attack with my bow.

So I think that's it for me.

[Referee (James)]
All right. Who's up next? Is that Liria?

Liria.

[(Finneas)]
Okay. How many rounds were we taking out of combat? Because I have Bladesong running.

[Referee (James)]
I will say two.

[(Finneas)]
Two rounds. Okay, so this would be...

[Referee (James)]
Eight rounds depending on the bandagement, and you will have Bladesong.

[(Finneas)]
Okay. That's 30 feet of movement. From here, I will engage my normal attack.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Wait, does it take...

[Speaker 11]
Oh, it does.

[Referee (James)]
What the fuck? That's annoying.

[(Finneas)]
It doesn't roll the damage.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you want to apply your... You want to add your... You want to roll for your weapon damage.

There you go.

[(Finneas)]
Booming Blade doesn't do the... I guess I should do the roll. Five damage if it moves.

And that's my turn.

[Referee (James)]
All right. I'm out to Liria and Chariz. Chariz.

[(Frogitha)]
All right. Uh, I'll fly up, seeing that there's something wrong. Oh boy.

Okay. That's a thing. Uh, okay.

Um, what was the verdict on this thing being able to be charmed?

[Referee (James)]
It can be.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, cool. How's it looking?

[Referee (James)]
It is... Yeah, it's looking pretty battered.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, um... So if he fails that, he gets 13. And also flees.

But before he can flee, I'm gonna shoot him. You want to roll the wisdom save first? Or do you want me to do the gun first?

[Heart]
Aha! Well, he's taking a shot.

[(Frogitha)]
Does he take half the damage? He does take half the damage.

[Referee (James)]
Basically, he takes the... I think 15. 15?

[Heart]
Is 15 it?

[Referee (James)]
15 just hits. You would know that if you had targeted him. Oh, why didn't he roll the target?

That's weird. Okay, high damage. Yeah.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, people should be able to pass through me because I'm small.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, that'll be my turn.

[Referee (James)]
All right, Princess2Mimosa.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. Um... This foe?

Is this? Yeah, this plan assassin.

[Referee (James)]
Never mind. Poison damage at the beginning of your turn. Oh!

Now, technically, it was from the attack. So you can half this. It'll be 20 instead of 40.

Oh!

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[(Nessie)]
Glad you can half that. Yeah, me too. Um...

Can I cut the vines that I'm...

[Referee (James)]
No.

[(Nessie)]
...being held? No.

[Referee (James)]
Well, you could attack the creature that is holding you. That is...

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
That is the same guy.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Uh... You relatively do have disadvantage on the attack.

[(Nessie)]
Cool, but I do have inspiration still, right?

[Baar-Ur]
Um... Hang on.

[(Nessie)]
Looking at which one of my daggers pushes them away.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's a sneak attack. Tyrant. You have to hit the tyrant twice.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah, tyrant's turn. Yeah!

[(Nessie)]
28 hit?

[Referee (James)]
28 does hit. You have disadvantage.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, yeah. Damn it. I mean, well, I can...

[Referee (James)]
It's a 19 hit. No, you see a 13. I don't know if you can actually...

[Speaker 10]
Oh, cool. Okay.

[(Nessie)]
And then... 13, so 15 hits.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Okay, it dies. You cut yourself...

It turns out you can cut yourself out anyways. Well, then.

[(Nessie)]
Um... I... Yes, I...

Can I move?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, I'm gonna move. I'm gonna use my bonus action to hit.

[Referee (James)]
Cool.

[(Nessie)]
Plus, hang on. Sneak attack.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[(Nessie)]
Because I've got my ammony.

[Referee (James)]
No, it's...

[(Nessie)]
I got my friend.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, um... Well, some of that it would be resistant to, because I think it takes less poison and less fire. But, uh...

But also, that's... During the physical damage, it's a total of 73, and I have 41 hit points left.

[(Nessie)]
I'm gonna look at Corpus, and I'm gonna say, you do that again, and you get to sit at the entrance of this cave for the rest of the time. And there's my turn.

[Referee (James)]
All righty. Brings us to Acrobatia.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Art, you're muted.

[Heart]
Dang nabbit. Thank you. So there is just the corpse flower.

I can't see it. Be able to. Let's see.

[Referee (James)]
45... You cannot see things behind walls. When you move beyond the...

When the wall is nowhere between you and the object, you will see the object.

[Heart]
Yes, I can see the corpse flower now.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so you used your action to dash. Do you have anything for your bows action?

[Heart]
I'm gonna... Was that dash distance?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, because you moved 35 feet to get just to here. Unless you have...

[Heart]
I have 50 feet of movement with my broom. So I was just trying to see what I have against an individual corpse flower. Are they resistant to being restrained?

Like, are they... Do they not have that condition?

[Speaker 10]
Would you...

[Heart]
Wait, no, can't do that, because I still have concentration on the banishment. Never mind.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, we'll send the flaming spear down.

[Heart]
Dang nabbit. I hold my spells... I will hold until something happens.

Like, if the corpse flower comes within range, I'm gonna hold my action, because I don't have a lot to do without dashing.

[Speaker 9]
That's fair.

[Heart]
Okay. Well, now that it's here, I'm going to hit it really hard and hope it works. Please make a charisma saving throw.

[Referee (James)]
It's you and up to eight willing creatures.

[Heart]
No, no, no, no. There's the extra action of you can banish an unwilling creature to another plane.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, cool.

[Heart]
That's what I'm doing. I'm now just whacking the thing with my staff. That's what the attack was for.

Okay, pretty cool. So it has to make a charisma saving throw, which it doesn't make. Yay.

So I'm sending...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you're screaming because you're pulling an actual die.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And it's identical to a success. That's so silly.

[Heart]
So it's gone. Where'd you send it? Positive energy plant.

It'll die in like a minute.

[Referee (James)]
You have a... The staff. Friendship.

The staff. But do you have a...

[Heart]
The staff counts as... No, you see, the staff counts as the component. So.

Okay, cool. So now it's just gone.

[Referee (James)]
I'll go over that later. Yeah, it's gone.

[Heart]
It doesn't come back. Goodbye. So turning to Mimosa.

That went horribly wrong rather quick.

[Referee (James)]
There's nothing else in the field right now.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
So you guys have now six rounds before the other critters come back. Irohna, you can mark down some collected ooze jelly. Up to four miles, if you so wish.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, what does the party want to do now?

[(Nessie)]
We have six rounds until what?

[Referee (James)]
Until the banishment.

[(Nessie)]
The banishment. Oh, okay. Oh, well, I would suggest that we move on really quickly.

[Heart]
Does anyone have locate creature?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I do. I was gonna do that when we got close enough and I forgot.

[Referee (James)]
You actually mentioned it.

[(Frogitha)]
There's a big hole here.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm gonna locate a creature.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm gonna locate the...

[Referee (James)]
It is down into the southwest. Wait, I'm sorry. I got you all.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, no. I was just gonna say specifically which creature.

[Referee (James)]
But I'm pretty sure you acknowledged. Yeah, no, that's it. So it is actually on the opposite side of the...

It's on the opposite side of the dungeon, but down.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, so you do have to go down first. Yeah, how dangerous does the hole look?

[Speaker 9]
I'm gonna push Corpus in.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, I'll go, you know, check it out, you know, at the cost of my life. We'll find out how deep it is.

[Baar-Ur]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
This one is actually 60 feet deep. The creature that you're targeting is not 60 feet down. Like, it's very...

It's down very, very, very slightly.

[Heart]
So other way.

[Speaker 9]
I could jump down this and lift because I have slow fall, but...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, yeah, you're already in the process of doing that.

[(Frogitha)]
No, because then you have to get up.

[Referee (James)]
That's fine. I don't know if you have... Your slow fall will...

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, I reduce any falling damage five times. So I reduce it by 40, so I take no damage.

[Referee (James)]
No damage, all right.

[Speaker 9]
All right, what do I see down here?

[Referee (James)]
You see a sparrow. Are you menacingly?

[(Finneas)]
Am I fighting this thing?

[Heart]
No. Is sparrow doing what? I am looking menacing.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, terrifying.

[Speaker 9]
I feel like I'm gonna have to fight this thing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, if you want to fight this sparrow... Don't! No!

[(Nessie)]
You're the sparrow that Polymorphs in. You're not gonna get any help from us.

[Speaker 10]
It is awesome if he fights it.

[Speaker 9]
No, we're leaving.

[(Frogitha)]
I will cast fly on you, but then I'm leaving.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, you have fly. Okay, perfect. There are mounts that can grab him.

Oh, well, this is...

[Heart]
There are mounts that can grab him.

[(Frogitha)]
Oh, yeah, I can get my dragon to grab you.

[Referee (James)]
There's a monkey that can also climb up. Wait, wait, let's try that again. What?

Is everybody... What's... what's happening?

[(Frogitha)]
I'm getting my wyvern to grab him.

[Referee (James)]
Is it big enough? It is not big enough for the wyvern to fly in. I may have to fight this thing.

[Speaker 9]
Is there another Kinesis?

[Heart]
We really don't.

[Speaker 9]
We really don't.

[Heart]
Just climb out.

[Speaker 9]
Just climb out. Okay, that's why I was about to ask. Is it possible to climb out?

Is there any nooks and crannies I can grab onto?

[(Nessie)]
Ugh, we have rope. Can I telekinesis?

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yeah, rope and telekinesis.

[(Nessie)]
Get out of the trash. Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 9]
All right, so you're using rope to get me up.

[Referee (James)]
So how does telekinesis... Okay, stop talking for the next five minutes. Can you ping telekinesis and Yussa in the chat there?

I was speaking to Illyrian. There we go.

[Speaker 10]
Mmm, 30 feet.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, at this point I'm gonna have everybody return to the initiative. Come out here. That's fine.

[(Frogitha)]
Oh boy, uh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, there is a loud popping sound. There's creatures have returned to their previous existence.

[(Frogitha)]
Fuck, all right, um, okay. I'm gonna cast Dissonant Whispers on him again. Actually, who goes next?

Mimosa. Um, I'll give you...

[(Nessie)]
Do I still have your Bardic Inspiration or did that end with combat?

[(Frogitha)]
I think you still have it.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, I'm trying to make sure to use it.

[(Frogitha)]
No, I'm gonna Dissonant Whispers the guy and shoot him. Oh, let me target him. I get to do that, as I always do.

Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, sorry about that, Chris.

[(Frogitha)]
Shoving me into the wall. How dare you.

[Referee (James)]
Six books in there, six books in there. He's at the end of your turn. Would you like to move anywhere else?

Mimosa, you are on deck.

[(Frogitha)]
I'm gonna move here.

[(Nessie)]
Where is the creature that we're fighting?

[Referee (James)]
I'm gonna have your Foglight of Wyvern return to... Oh, there's what? There's a rather small one.

They're all in the previous room.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay, okay. Okay, they're all back here.

[(Nessie)]
All right, well, yeah, I'll go. All right, I only see this. Oh, great, it was...

This is the only guy, right? Yep. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
But I don't know if that's going to change your reaction there.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, well, probably not. I'll just kill him. No, maybe it's not magical weapons.

Okay. Let's use my bonus action to kill... I don't know if they like oozes, but that's what they get.

Can you team hit?

[Referee (James)]
It does hit.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Referee (James)]
Fuck, Razor's just...

[Speaker 10]
Disgusting.

[(Nessie)]
Well, can't be too picky, darling.

[Referee (James)]
I can in my room.

[(Nessie)]
No.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, no haste.

[Heart]
That's fine. I'm talking about here. Can we hear the snipe or just Mimosa talking to herself?

[Referee (James)]
Getting a little unabsorbed. Coming up on that, uh, soul dooday, just like, you know. All right, Mimosa, moving anywhere else?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I'll let him hold him. Now it's my turn. She killed a bunch of pirates with him.

[Referee (James)]
It doesn't matter. I need one every three days. You don't get a...

[(Nessie)]
We just killed a creature in the other room.

[(Finneas)]
Um, were those two creatures the only ones banished or are there more back there?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There are more. I think there were more.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
You guys are out of initiative. There are more.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Is this one, like, not alive?

[(Finneas)]
Wait, did you just say we're out of initiative?

[Referee (James)]
Until you guys are out of initiative.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, until we're out of initiative. Okay, gotcha. All right, um, all right.

So I'll use up all my 40 movement. See a bunch of guys there. I'm just gonna blast a fireball.

[Referee (James)]
Let's go. No, the shambling...

[(Finneas)]
Holy shit, that's irritating.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, sorry.

[(Finneas)]
I was placing my thing and someone talked and it yanked my...

[Speaker 10]
Sorry. That's negative one.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It still shows on the initiative for me, so I wasn't sure.

[Referee (James)]
Very good. Okay. Anything with your bonus action?

[(Finneas)]
Uh, nothing with my bonus action. Whichever one resisted, I want to have my guy fireball that one.

[Speaker 10]
That's good.

[Referee (James)]
And hence, if you are going to be out of... You're going to be out of Bladesinger.

[Speaker 11]
Okay. There you go.

[(Finneas)]
All right. I guess I'll renew... I'll use another charge of Bladesinger.

Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, will that hit? And do you wish to shield? That will hit.

[(Finneas)]
That would... That will normally hit. Yeah, I will shield.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. That is it's turn. We come now to Dr. Bastia. Okay.

[Heart]
Move so I can... I can see the things. I'll drop a regular.

Fireball.

[Baar-Ur]
These things are going to be dead before I get there.

[Speaker 10]
That's fine.

[Heart]
And that will be my turn.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, we come now to... Actually, I'll... There we go.

That one's still alive. Corpus!

[Speaker 9]
Okay, am I still in the hole? Or did I climb the rope?

[Referee (James)]
Nope, you're actually currently telekinesis. Oh. You're presently restrained, in fact.

[Speaker 9]
Well, um... I know what I can do.

[(Finneas)]
However...

[Speaker 9]
However? I really do love being restrained.

[Referee (James)]
I also love you being restrained.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Don't worry, I can fly there for you. Okay, anything that you would like to do on your turn?

[Speaker 9]
Um, yeah, what does being restrained prevent me from doing again? Moving. Just moving?

Okay.

[(Finneas)]
Wait, is he restrained by my telekinesis? Is that the thing?

[Referee (James)]
He's also now restrained by an assassin body.

[(Finneas)]
Oh. Because I think the way telekinesis works is that if I don't do anything on my turn, the restrain, the effect ends. Like, I'm still concentrating.

I can still do it on a subsequent turn.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, well I'm going to heal up. I'm going to use Wholeness of Body. Give me that healing.

[Referee (James)]
Mind out of the way because the first attack would have hit.

[Speaker 9]
And I'm going to use my bonus action for patient defense. And I'm going to use a hit dice for this with Dwarven Fortitude. And I'll do all the calculations next person goes.

[Referee (James)]
Sounds good to me. That brings us to the colony gnome flinger. It's going to fling some of the remains of its body there.

Nice.

[(Nessie)]
I'll avenge you, bro. Give me some of your dead body.

[Referee (James)]
I can both say you're getting flung at.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I figured I will.

[Speaker 10]
I'm gonna die too. Hey! All right, how far away are you?

[(Nessie)]
Um, too far? I don't know.

[Referee (James)]
No, you're well within. It's what the damage.

[(Nessie)]
I figured.

[Referee (James)]
How many, uh, tell me how far away you are.

[(Nessie)]
I'm 58.

[Referee (James)]
I just want to look at it. No, I just want to look at it.

[(Nessie)]
Whoops, wrong person. I'm... No, I'm 58.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah. I'm gonna dodge it.

[Referee (James)]
Just take the win. Fixing damage. Smacks off the ceiling and starts, like, bouncing around.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, gross.

[(Nessie)]
I'm going to dodge that. That's disgusting.

[Referee (James)]
Till the end of your next turn. The... yeah, so that's...

Yeah, it's the end of your next turn, so he was still restrained. You can... you can go back and you can, uh...

That's up to where you restrain him. All right, so you take half damage. We come now to Tigra.

You can now hear additional movement from the hole. With the slinging bushes and a very angry sparrow.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, what's this big guy?

[Referee (James)]
That's an assassin vine that's down the hole. All right, it's down in the hole? Yep.

You can see it. You got double sight.

[Baar-Ur]
Eh, fuck him.

[Referee (James)]
All the other fighting is currently down, directly in sight.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, um... I'm gonna have to dash because I can't see anything.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, if you went around the other way you would have been able to, uh... See them, I think.

[Baar-Ur]
Eh, everybody else went this direction, so...

[Speaker 9]
That's probably reasonable.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, um... So, because I dashed, I can only do something with bonus action.

[Speaker 8]
Um...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's concentration.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, I will cast Hunter's Mark, I guess. On... Um, what...

What down here looks toughest?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, there's only... There's only the, um... Flinger.

Okay, then I'll cast it on the Nova Flinger.

[Baar-Ur]
All right, and that's it for me.

[Referee (James)]
That's good. Brings us to...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Arab. I'm gonna... Join the crew.

Uh... I will give Mimosa a bonus action, y'know? Oh, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Ah, ah, where's my spellbook? Where's my spellbook? You used your action to dash.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Healing Bird. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, that brings us to... Charis.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, um... Where is this thing that we're fighting?

[(Nessie)]
Down here, darling. Over here. So...

Careful, careful, careful. You might get flown. So yeah, there you go.

[(Frogitha)]
How far is that? 50? Perfect.

Just the amount that I can shoot.

[(Nessie)]
Yay.

[(Frogitha)]
17? Uh, if 17 hits, you will take 29 damage.

[(Finneas)]
Okay. Who would?

[Referee (James)]
If you would like, you could also have, uh... What is it? You could have Skylark...

[(Frogitha)]
Uh, yeah, I'll get... What does that do?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, you can have advantage, and you can add 1d6 to your damage.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, so that's a 30, 20. And then you said a 1d6 to my damage?

[Speaker 10]
Mm-hmm.

[(Frogitha)]
All right, so that's a 30 damage. Um, and then I can Bardic Inspiration. Um...

Do you still have Bardic Inspiration, Mosa, or should I give it to Lirion?

[(Nessie)]
I still have it. I would assume.

[(Frogitha)]
I haven't used it yet. I always try to go with the person that's next. Yeah.

Lirion, you get Bardic Inspiration.

[Speaker 11]
How big?

[Speaker 8]
Uh, 1d8. And that will be my turn.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, okay. Yeah, last one up is Mimipsa.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okie dokie, I'm just gonna...

[(Nessie)]
Get up there and bonus action. Dash. Rest the wave.

Um... Does he have... I don't know.

I don't... My mind's having trouble figuring out how I would kill it, but I will just dagger it, I guess.

[Baar-Ur]
Dagger dagger.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, dagger the wood.

[Speaker 10]
Um...

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I'll just do this. It's an 18 hit.

[Referee (James)]
18 does in fact hit.

[Speaker 10]
Cool.

[Speaker 8]
Yippee.

[Heart]
Now the only thing left...

[Referee (James)]
The only thing left of the board is the... A porpoise is fighting with... A critter, technically.

[(Nessie)]
Does anybody want tea?

[Speaker 9]
Oh, you're fucking hilarious.

[(Nessie)]
You're being funny. Fine. It's not my turn anyway.

[(Finneas)]
Have we mopped up the things down there? I lost visibility so I can't see the... Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Porpoise is fighting something, so...

[(Finneas)]
Is this difficult terrain up on this hill where Lirian is?

[Referee (James)]
No, no, it's not.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[(Finneas)]
Can I... Is it bootstrapping to like telekinesis myself forward? 30 feet?

Like pick myself up with telekinesis?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What are you trying to do?

[Speaker 10]
Move...

[(Finneas)]
Move from here... To here. And I assume that...

I assume this is like maybe rough or impassable terrain, so walking through it might be really difficult.

[Referee (James)]
No, no, that's just like the wall. That's just the wall. Are...

I'm a little confused.

[Heart]
Are you arranged to still tug Corpus?

[Referee (James)]
Could you do a tug of war? Wait, so please, please. He's not...

So... That's just like a wall. I'm a little bit confused what you're trying to...

Where are you trying to get to?

[(Finneas)]
Well, uh, am I if... I'm not sure where I am. Did I blast through a wall?

Am I on top of a mound?

[Referee (James)]
I don't know how you're there even.

[(Finneas)]
I didn't move myself. I assume I got flung.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you're tokenly rogue. No, I think your thing got moved. Last I remembered, you went down here and felt the fireball.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, that's what I remembered. But then I was trying to reconstruct it from the chat log, and I assume I got flung. All right, this will make it easy.

Double move to there. End the turn.

[Speaker 11]
Vacio.

[Heart]
Okay, um, let's see. I guess we've got to save this guy. So...

50, which is my own movement. And you're restrained. Okay.

I actually... What can I do with this? I will banish this thing so we can get away with it, and he can be freed from being restrained.

This. Regular banishment. And that will be my turn.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Mm-hmm. It's okay, James is arguing.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, I don't know why I'm doing this right now.

[(Nessie)]
It's bad when I do that.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so that is that. Corpus, go ahead and do whatever you would like to.

[Speaker 9]
I mean, can I hit him at all? I can't move. I don't think I'm in range to smack, so if I can't do that, that's my turn.

You can smack it.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, thank you.

[Heart]
I... didn't I... She banished it.

[Referee (James)]
She tried to cast banishment. I was distracted. So you banish it.

I'll be out of initiative while I go to the bathroom.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Heart]
I look rather exciting for a scouting trip.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, next time we say we should scout, maybe we should follow the plan and only have one person scout?

[Speaker 9]
I mean, I moved because I zoned out.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't fucking zone out.

[(Nessie)]
We told you not to move, and you kept moving.

[Heart]
You did actually get hit with the, are you sure? And you were like, yeah. Right.

Well, Para has locate Cretron, so that should be...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yep, other end of the thing and a little bit down. So we have to figure out how to get a little bit down. Um, anybody got a shovel?

[Heart]
I suppose we can work on the little bit down.

[Speaker 10]
We should also find a way for James to get back.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I mean, we can plan. We can plan. That's true.

This would be a great planning time. I mean, there's a little bit where we haven't really seen. Yeah, I'm definitely not going to try and explore and move while he's not around.

Yeah, that feels a little silly. Just go back to where I was. Well, I mean, we can go to areas we've been before, but like, I don't want to accidentally trigger like another enemy that he, you know, he's not here to tell us we've triggered.

[Heart]
No.

[Baar-Ur]
Did I miss anything? Uh-uh.

[(Nessie)]
Well, Para wants us to dig down with shovels.

[Baar-Ur]
That seems a little unnecessary. But no.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh no, she's been bagged!

[(Nessie)]
She did it herself!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh my god, the fucking chew marks!

[(Nessie)]
It is like, it's her bag and now it never moves. She's also dragged it out of the box, but I might put it back. Chasing kitty heaven.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, too cute.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, we're ticking down to an hour for us. Yeah. So, with banishment, if you send it, it's random completely?

Oh, banishment or plane shift? Banishment. Okay, with banishment...

So like, if you, so if you, let's say you banish something that's from another plane and it goes back to that plane, does it just go into a random location in that plane?

[Heart]
I, you know, I think so.

[Baar-Ur]
It's... I'm looking at the description. If the target is native to the plane you're on, then it's banished to a harmless demi-plane.

If it's native to a different plane than the one you're on, then it returns to its home plane.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, but like, it doesn't say anything about specific... Yeah, it's just random.

[Baar-Ur]
I think it's, I think from the description, my impression is that it's kind of like, if you could harmlessly put someone in a bag of holding.

[Heart]
So probably somewhere harmless in the plane. Otherwise, I imagine it would cause a lot of... Actually, it would be interesting.

Could someone in the other plane attack the banished creature? I suppose.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, like, if you, if it stays in its home plane, is what I'm thinking. Like, oh, like... If it's on a different kind of...

Like, say, for no particular reason, if we sent Corpus back home with a banishment, would he go back to where, like... I mean, James, because he's a player, James would absolutely send it back probably to, like, Sears Keep or anything. But, like, in the rule of the spell, it doesn't say that he would go to one specific area or, like, where he's from from.

It just says home plane. So, like, anywhere on the planet. It could be the middle of the sea, yes.

[Baar-Ur]
But, you know. It would be pretty funny to have...

[Speaker 9]
Don't worry, Corpus got that constitution of 20, and, you know, I feel like he'd be able to swim across the ocean if he tried.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, cool, let's test it out.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, that's pretty...

[Baar-Ur]
It would be pretty funny to have a random table. I mean, you could probably use the terrain generation table to determine where they get dropped.

[Speaker 10]
Maybe, yeah.

[Heart]
Suppose it's just how the DM rules it for stuff like sending a player home or character or whatever. Can you cast banishment on yourself? You can, but because it makes you incapacitated, I think...

[Speaker 10]
Oh, okay, if you're on your sense...

[Heart]
For the Demi plane, yes. For a regular plane, I believe not. Let's see.

Yeah, while on the Demi plane, they're incapacitated. However, if it's their native plane, they are not. So you can cast banishment on yourself if you're on a different plane and you want to leave.

You just have to hold it for a minute.

[Baar-Ur]
We could get there and do our job and then somebody banished us all home one point.

[Heart]
I won. Plane shifting will be cheaper, I promise you. I can just do that.

It would be very funny, though. Actually, yeah, that's a valid mode of travel. If I run out of plane shifts, I can just banish the rest.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I know I can't EBDB when I'm not on our home plane. Which is sad.

[Heart]
What do you mean?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have an ability from my cloak that lets me cast a darkness. And then while... Actually, technically, it's while anyone is in within magical darkness.

Hang on, can I... We're not on the home plane, so I wouldn't be able to... Anyway, it lets me send people to EBDB.

Oh! Yeah, you can target a creature in magical darkness. They have to make a charisma save or be transported to the world below for 24 hours.

Oh! Oh, that one! Yeah, EBDB.

This would have been a very fun use of EBDB, but we're not on the home plane, so we can't send them to the world below. Is the world below a separate plane? I think it's just like the Underdark.

[Heart]
Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think... I've asked him about this, but I never can remember. Because he's got like 12 different worlds that all sound very similarly in the dark.

Underdark, world below, the deep. And I have bad memory. It's like facial blindness, but for locations.

I just know I've asked if I can do it while we're on another plane, and he has said no, so... I am okay with that. I still think the best use was sending one of Landy's gnomes into the Underdark.

How many times can you use that per day? Once per character. There was no limit.

[Heart]
Oh, okay, so you can only do it once per character you send down there. However, technically, feasibly, you could just keep doing it to a whole group of people.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. That's awesome. I can only target once per day a specific...

I can only target a specific creature once per day. There we go. Do you want the chair?

Are you kicking me out?

[(Frogitha)]
Oh, okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There was a group of 30 people, I could target all 30 people once. And if they succeed, then they've, you know, succeeded, but... Um...

Hi, Dex. Are you done chewing on all of the pop chip bags?

[Baar-Ur]
No, not yet.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Penelope's laying on me.

[(Nessie)]
They won't give her the chair, so I will do.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Hi, Dex. Are you gonna try and cuddle? No, you're gonna smash your face into my hand?

Is that all you want? I love the way Kat's headbutt things. Like, just so...

whole-bodied, yet affectionate. Oh, please don't do that to my microphone. I was trying to send you guys headbutts.

Aww. Let's see.

[Speaker 10]
Cuddle.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, don't wiggle. You want attention. I know you do.

That's why you're headbutting me.

[(Nessie)]
Fine, that was just my husband.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, what is 11 minus 8? Which is, uh... 3?

Alright.

[(Finneas)]
So what are we looking for in this place, exactly?

[(Nessie)]
A meow meow. Whoa.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, two people and a gargantuan bat mouse cross.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, the meow meow. Mouse griffin, yes. Mouse worm.

[Heart]
Mouse bat griffin.

[(Finneas)]
I feel like you're just saying words now.

[Heart]
Yeah. That's fair. Mouse.

[Speaker 10]
Worm. Griffin.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Lamb. Spoon. It's a mouse bat.

It's called a mowsmer.

[(Nessie)]
She got there eventually. We're proud of her.

[(Frogitha)]
Mouse bat's cuter, though.

[(Nessie)]
Mouse bat is cuter.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
A mat.

[Heart]
I think a mouse bat's an actual type of bat, too. Obviously not a cross between a mouse and a bat, but...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Nope, just mouse-eared bat. If I was gonna call anything a mouse bat, it would be the pipistrelle.

[(Frogitha)]
Pipistrelle. I wanna pet one, but I think that's how we get COVID, so... Or is that eating it?

I don't know.

[Speaker 10]
It was poorly cooked.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's rabies you tend to get from bats. You can pet pipistrelles, though, if you volunteer. My friend used to volunteer with them.

How do you spell that? I'll send a picture in the thing, and then I'll send the picture.

[Speaker 10]
So there's what they look like.

[Baar-Ur]
P-I-P-I-S-T-R-E-L-L-E. Pipistrelle.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, thank you.

[(Frogitha)]
Thank you, thank you. I can totally volunteer to help wild animals. I grew up on a farm and I work with animals.

That's my job. I think I'm the perfect person to go.

[(Nessie)]
What's your job?

[Heart]
I do pet sitting.

[(Nessie)]
Ooh, that's awesome.

[Heart]
It pays really well, too.

[(Nessie)]
I bet it does.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I keep getting something on my emails because I'm part of the massage... He's knocking stuff over now with his face. I get a lot of massage CE stuff.

Classes I can take to keep my license up. And I've been getting a lot of things where it's like, hey, do you want to do a horse massage? And it's like, yes, you do.

Yes. I'm terrified of horses. I get it.

[(Nessie)]
You'd also have to start a whole new school of learning. Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, not really, but I think there's... I would have to look up the massage requirements for veterinary in Oregon because the Board of Massage Therapy does not care about animals. That's veterinary.

That's what I mean.

[(Nessie)]
You'd have to start doing veterinary stuff. Yeah. But I bet you, you'd get paid really nicely.

Especially where you are. You know there's bougie, ritzy people who would absolutely love an animal massage.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
My client's mom is one of them. Yeah, exactly. It was lucrative.

[(Frogitha)]
People that own horses are usually either really rich or poor because they own horses.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[(Frogitha)]
You'll get paid well for that.

[(Nessie)]
My sister gets paid really well because she's fabulous with labradoodles.

[Heart]
Aww.

[(Nessie)]
And she's kind of famous for grooming labradoodles. She's famous for grooming labradoodles.

[Heart]
So...

[(Nessie)]
Most of her clientele are labradoodles.

[(Frogitha)]
I never actually expected to find myself working with animals but I think that's the path that will be of least resistance.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Mmhmm.

[(Frogitha)]
So that's the path I'm gonna go.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And hey, look, most of the time if an animal is a dick to you, it's not as bad.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, because you don't have to hear anything out of their mouth besides grunts. Or neighs.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Or barks.

[Heart]
No, you can't bite. It's also easier to justify them being mean to you than a person. Because you can reason, aww, maybe it's just upset or something.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
With a person, you're like, come on. Come on, man. Did you really need to throw the hot water right back onto the barista for no reason?

[(Frogitha)]
Oh, god.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I remember when Starbucks had that string of people doing that shit. Ugh.

[(Frogitha)]
I would lose my job and my freedom that day.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I feel like legally they would not be able to say anything because at that point it becomes self-defense.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, I saw recently a woman, like, she knocked the shit out of somebody because they ate. And they were, the cops were like, oh yeah, this guy, we're gonna go get this guy. You're good.

[Speaker 10]
Alright, I'm here.

[Referee (James)]
What's up?

[(Frogitha)]
Welcome back.

[Referee (James)]
I heard that people were, oh, it just shows, oh, only visible to moderators. I wasn't sure if that was, uh... Shut up, everybody.

Okay, I heard, and I've just come back briefly. Almost done with my food, but I heard of an intention to dig.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I asked if anyone had a shovel, and I don't think anyone has a shovel.

[Heart]
I think that was if we got to the place and couldn't find them.

[Speaker 11]
Because if you get to the, if you're following the, if you're looking around for a spot that you could dig, the location that's directly above them is here.

[Speaker 8]
It's in this room.

[Referee (James)]
Which has a spherical lump. Well, not completely spherical. It looks like the top of a, the very top of a sphere.

It's kind of bulging out from the ground here. Ooh, that's suspicious. And there's a lot of cracks in it.

[Speaker 8]
So very diggable. Yeah. Well, there's rock in there.

[Speaker 11]
Somebody can hear. Uh, Dr. Buck, speak here.

[Speaker 8]
Um, did you say a rock?

[Speaker 11]
Let's try his arcana check earlier.

[Referee (James)]
He would know that, like, blood-like colonies will sometimes create a, sometimes basically create organs and such. In their homes, whatever it is that they infest, will create makeshift organs. And this is one that would have actually, that's large enough, and you can see the cracks kind of have, like, a repeated structure in the, in the roof above you.

[Speaker 11]
This is like a mouth. The hole that you guys found in the north end is not large enough for the mosomore to pass through.

[Speaker 8]
But this one, if it were open, it's... Does anyone have shaped stone? You know what?

I think I might have that spell. Let's see. I have spider-climb.

Stone shape, right?

[Speaker 11]
We're all out of initiative at this point, right?

[Referee (James)]
I know that Charis has the hearth wand of stone.

[Speaker 8]
Do?

[Referee (James)]
Yes.

[Speaker 8]
That might be more effective.

[Referee (James)]
Probably, I think that the only time that one came up was probably well over a year ago.

[(Frogitha)]
Oh my god, okay. Well, I need to add that. Is that a thing I can add through plutonium?

[Speaker 11]
No, but not through plutonium. I could do that in the items.

[Referee (James)]
Wand of stone, yeah. I knew it was in yours. It's eight charges, two for erupting earth, has eight charges, two for erupting earth, four for stone shape, six for wall of stone.

[Speaker 8]
Where can I drag that?

[Referee (James)]
I just add it to out of character, and... I don't know how to do spell effects in items.

[Speaker 8]
Unless, of course, you turn them into an actor.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I can make some for you later. The way I use mine is I gave them charges, and then I just added them to my spell book and set it so that they would use charges from the specific ones. That's very in-depth, but it's what I did.

[(Frogitha)]
I guess I could make...

[Speaker 11]
Can you give it infinitely many charges and just put the spell in it?

[Speaker 8]
Well, because it takes charges to use.

[Speaker 11]
I'm not sure why you would give it infinitely many charges.

[(Finneas)]
Oh, I thought the problem was there's a spell that grants you the ability, or there's an item that grants you the ability to cast a spell, and so when you have the item, you want the spell to appear on your spell list.

[Referee (James)]
The issue is actually attaching a spell, putting a spell inside of an item, and then have it show up in your character sheet in a way that lets you use it there.

[Speaker 11]
Use it. Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And I use it the really long, roundabout way that makes it super easy and not have to focus on it.

[Speaker 8]
What kind of item is a wand? I have made it a trinket, but I don't know what they actually count a wand as. A wand is a consumable.

[Speaker 11]
Consumable in 5th edition, because for some reason I can't add a trinket.

[Speaker 8]
It's a type of equipment.

[Speaker 11]
No, no, I know.

[Referee (James)]
No, it's definitely a consumable. When I go into the Items tab, this is what we're talking about. When I go into the Items tab of Foundry VTT, when I click Create Item, it gives me a list of things that I can make.

Background, class, consumable, containers, so on and so forth.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. A trinket is a type of equipment.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, so I do have a mention to wand in...

[Speaker 8]
Oh, really? Wait, they don't get consumed?

[Speaker 11]
Let's assume...

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, they do.

[Speaker 11]
They have charges.

[Referee (James)]
Well, they can react to it. They regain charges, but you are consuming those charges.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's weird, because you can do that for other things, too.

[Referee (James)]
Here's the thing. When you have different systems in Foundry VTT, they treat these things differently. If you did that in Pathfinder 2nd edition, that is probably a thing that you could do in Pathfinder 2nd edition.

I don't know if it's a thing that you could do in 5e. Unless you did it in 5e.

[Speaker 8]
I mean...

[(Finneas)]
Consumables don't have to be destroyed when they're out of charges, right?

[Referee (James)]
No, no, no, but that's... Yes, but it is under a consumable thing.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I've copied a hearth wand of Eclipse, I have a hearth wand of Bonfire, but I also have them linked... The easy route, I think, would just be to cast the spell.

[Referee (James)]
That is probably me.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, who has it? I think Basha said you have it?

[Referee (James)]
No, no, it's Charis. Which I was in a year. It was last November.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, now that I see the thing, I kind of vaguely remember it.

[Speaker 8]
I think Basha said that Basihalso has it? The wand's probably the easier path of least resistance.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, I'll use the wand to take a charge from the, what, stone shape? Yeah, so that'll be 3 stone shape after that.

[Speaker 8]
To open. There you go, so you do it through innate spellcasting. Yeah, just to have it in a spot.

[Speaker 11]
Right, okay, that's pretty good.

[Referee (James)]
And then if you click on one of those, does it actually do that, the charge?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, because when you go into the edit and the details, there's a resource consumption option, and I can just use it on an item. And I can set how many uses it uses, so the ones that cost only one charge, I can have one, and then if I have sunburst is 8, it uses 8.

[Speaker 8]
Nice. That way I actually know.

[Referee (James)]
Nice, I'm looking at it now. Yeah, that's actually not that bad, and I could probably, the way that I could do that inside of the item is, I don't know what they kick, because I can't pull the fucking spells in them, but maybe whenever I drop a I wonder if the Wand of Magic Pistols does this.

[Speaker 8]
Can I try the Wand of Magic Pistols to the way it does it?

[Speaker 11]
Okay, so the way that one does it is by just clicking on the wand in the inventory.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, so it just

[Referee (James)]
attaches the, so the way the Wand of Magic Missiles does it in Plutonium and stuff like that, is it just adds this information, it just adds the information of Magic Missile to the wand's details, and then when you click on the wand, it just, it acts like it's casting Magic Missile, but it can't hold the spell inside, it can't hold spells that can be expended inside items, because why on earth would you want that in the game of D&D?

And then that's... Well, there you go. In any case, you guys would be able to open, and you would see a resilient sphere containing a Mosimoor and two unconscious two unconscious gentlemen beneath you.

[Speaker 8]
I think you mean it, meow meow. Meow meow.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Is resilient sphere a thing, or that we have to get through?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, because right now they're unconscious.

[(Finneas)]
Yeah, Odaluk's resilient sphere, I think you can move the sphere and like, I think I can also just dispel magic. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Do you have to like upcast it, or? I can upcast it. Yeah, so your options are to make a roll, adding your spellcasting ability modifier, or to cast at least a 6-level.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I have a 6-level spell slot left, I'll do 6. Perfect. I was gonna do it at 8, but...

You're just gonna tell me.

[Referee (James)]
I think Odaluk's resilient sphere is a 6-level spell.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. I'll dispel its magic.

[Referee (James)]
You have dispelled its magic. No longer magical. The rest of the island, everything else that is active inside this horrific place has begun moving.

What would you guys like to do? Start scrambling.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Leave, yeah. Yeah, we gotta grab the guys. Oh, it's also unconscious.

Can we polymorph it into something small, or is that...

[Referee (James)]
I could do that, yeah.

[Heart]
There's also the option of being able to...

[Referee (James)]
It will take me with it, but I could teleport them to the...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay. Teleport's one action. I could teleport us back to the port.

Does anyone have anything from the port?

[Heart]
Yes, I took a rock.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I made sure to actually add that in my inventory.

[Referee (James)]
Mimosa has 25 gold pieces worth of souvenirs.

[Speaker 8]
I didn't want to say it. Wow. I didn't want it to get broken.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Holy shit. Up to 8 willing creatures. It doesn't expend anything.

I can take the rest of them. Okay, so we got 1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6...

7, 8...

[Referee (James)]
You're not worried about them getting consumed by the spell, you're worried about them getting... You're worried about... It's handled.

Grubby hands all over them.

[(Nessie)]
Exactly. I wouldn't trust Para with it. She absolutely would trust Para, but Dr. Basia also...

[Heart]
I have my own rock. I have my own rock.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so we can both teleport out back to the port and go, woohoo! I'm affronted that you'd think my hand's Grubby.

[Heart]
How dare you? You'll both have to use teleport based on the number of creatures you have with you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What was that?

[Referee (James)]
You'll both have to use teleport based on the number of creatures you have with you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, we both are.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah. Oh, does Para need something from the port?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. That's what I said. Give me a chopstick.

[Baar-Ur]
Okay, okay. I also picked up a rock or something.

[(Nessie)]
Oh! Oh, see, Para picked up a rock. There you go.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What's in there? Alright, so Basia can grab Lyrian, Corpus, and the Griffon, and then I'll grab everybody else.

[Speaker 10]
Alright.

[(Nessie)]
Oh yeah, what about the mounts?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm including the mounts. Oh, okay. It can go in one of ours.

[Heart]
It doesn't matter. We have enough. It's 16 between the two of us.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, actually, 18 between the two of us. Including ourselves. Yeah.

I forgot that the other dudes that were here with us Um, yeah. Anyway, we have enough spots. We just grab who we grab.

We go.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Well, congratulations on a success there. I will be around for some for some for deploying XP and for answering some RP questions.

You rescued a rich guy, so go support. We can leverage that into a favor, as usual. Tamer, for rescuing him, you have the favor of getting a discount on the Mozamor, so that Bar can have a tremendously wonderful pet, inspired by Monster Hunter World.

And besides that, the session is concluded. You guys are free to hang out or go other places as you wish. Isn't that right, buddy?

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Heart]
You're still icky from the goblin to the face, right?

[(Nessie)]
Oh, I pressed the digitated that off already.

[Referee (James)]
No, it wasn't a goblin. It was a violet fungus.

[(Nessie)]
Eww, more fungus. I know. She would have...

You would have heard her scream. And then she would have pressed the digitated that off. Yes, she's a...

Her halfling trait is hospitality. So she has pressed the digitation, purified drink, and food, and unseen servant.

[Heart]
That's awesome. Yeah.

[(Finneas)]
Uh, I'm wondering if there's anything here for Romulus to eat. Or is it all plants? Oh, we teleported out of there.

[Speaker 10]
So we're back at the port.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You can probably find food there.

[Baar-Ur]
There was a shambling mound made of undead. You could eat that.

[(Finneas)]
Ooh, I don't think I want to feed the griffin undead.

[Referee (James)]
Get a bone griffin, sweet! You do have a zombify template.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, James, can you please either post the stats for the Mozamor again, or just, like, reply to yourself?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, okay, so Oh, I can actually do that. I'm already on it. What?

Gotta love otter!

[Referee (James)]
I'm not even touching you right now.

[Speaker 8]
You're just shouting. There you go. Careful.

[Speaker 9]
Might start barking. Now the cat's gonna bark. Gonna get you.

[Speaker 10]
What?

[(Frogitha)]
Oh, cat voices.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I could've sworn there was a kingmaker food that was violet fungus. I believe it.

[Referee (James)]
I'm not finding it. Oh, that's what I wanted to mention. Okay, so, I don't know, Frogatha, I don't know if you saw this, I put a .json file in for Silverflow, which is the converted, the mostly converted, glitter wire. I think you used it earlier.

[(Frogitha)]
Uh, what did I use earlier? Oh!

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I don't know if I used that.

[Referee (James)]
One of your cats did it. Yeah, so what you do is you right-click on an actor and you click import and it will ask you for a .json file, which is that thing that I posted. Right?

And so what I've now started doing is I've started asking ChatGPT to just take the stat block and then import it.

[(Frogitha)]
Gotta love AI. I did, however, input all of the stuff.

[Speaker 10]
Mm-hmm.

[(Frogitha)]
Um, so if you want to just look over that. Although it might not hurt to...

[Speaker 8]
Um...

[Referee (James)]
I want to see if this one works. Yeah, so this one didn't actually do... This one did not actually provide the cone template or anything like that, but that's fine.

Oh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I love the glitter glands.

[Referee (James)]
I'm glad you do.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have some. That's what's funny.

[(Frogitha)]
Anything glitter-related, Charis is all over you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have some glitter hide and I thought I had some glitter glands, but I might have... Yeah, I have an intact glitter gland. Oh, don't show the beastie.

[(Frogitha)]
The glitter gland is the mortal enemy of glitter.

[(Nessie)]
Well, yeah, it's gonna get all stuck in her fur.

[(Frogitha)]
Yeah, exactly. And then, just...

[(Finneas)]
Oh, there should be, like, a unique interaction between glitter and that, like... What's the glue? The, like, permanent glue?

Sovereign glue. Sovereign glue and glitter interaction.

[Heart]
Oh god. To summon the lord of hell or something. How do you never be unshiny again?

[(Frogitha)]
My, uh, my dragon here... Well, not dragon, but my wyvern... Wyvern?

Wyvern? Whatever. Um...

Has a glitter breath.

[Speaker 10]
So, that's...

[Referee (James)]
Wasn't a glitter gland. It's not actually breath, it just has these glands basically under its armpits and shakes those out.

[Speaker 8]
I love that.

[(Frogitha)]
Actually, I think I bought one one time and I actually own one of the glands. I keep it with me and just, like, poof it for dramatic effect sometimes.

[(Finneas)]
Hey, um... James, what do you think about, uh, ranged version... ranged weapon cantrips?

[Referee (James)]
Ranged weapon cantrips. Interesting.

[(Frogitha)]
Okay, I gotta go, you guys.

[Heart]
We'll see you tonight. I also need to go to sleep soon, so... Good night.

[(Finneas)]
I have a Mask of Nyarlathotep game in about an hour.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, we've got, like, 20-ish minutes.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, that's pretty good.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was gonna stick around to see if we got XP in that time.

[Speaker 10]
Yes, I will. Oh, my bad.

[Speaker 11]
What, baby? What's the matter? What's the matter, buddy?

[Speaker 8]
You're so mad.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, uh, yes. I will provide the XP and such. But thanks again for playing, and I'll see you guys later.

Ow, you are being too rough.

[Speaker 8]
Good to see you.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, see ya!

[Speaker 8]
What's the matter, buddy?

[James]
Oh, he's deeply frightened by our tickling. Alright, there we go. Now I should be able to hear again.

[Frogitha]
Hello. Oh, welcome.

[James]
Very good.

[Nessie]
Hi. Hello. Otter won't be able to join us for a few hours.

[James]
That's okay.

[Nessie]
She forgot she had to work today. Oh.

[Frogitha]
Happens. And D&D isn't more important? Oh, what the heck?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, hi buddy. Meh.

[Frogitha]
Priorities, man.

[Speaker 5]
Quit your job. Adapt. Overcome.

[James]
Unironically, though, I'm going to start... I got a new profile already. I'm getting ready to...

I'm getting ready to apply for a bunch of government jobs near me and stuff like that. And Durian got me a referral link for testing for, what should we call it? Not OpenSea.

Lots of other things. But unironically, I'm like, I would like to better accommodate my D&D schedule by having more hours to work and making more money and just working different hours, please. Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Bass. Yes, good boy. Look over here.

Do you remember off the top of your head the dragons we fought in the last sequence?

[James]
Yes, so Solgrazier, an adult blue dragon, of which nobody knows the name, and an adult amethyst dragon, which nobody knows the name.

[Frogitha]
I'm going to start asking their names.

[Speaker 5]
So they were both adults, okay.

[James]
All three of them were adults. Solgrazier, still being alive, of course, is still an adult.

[Nessie]
We didn't kill him, so I don't think he counts.

[James]
He counts for... you defeated him, though, so that counts for points.

[Heart]
I've got several questions to what exactly is happening, though. Because, you know, it wasn't there. I'm not sure what's happening exactly.

Could someone summarize what on earth happened?

[Frogitha]
So we went into... what is it called? The Brilliance Pool of Reflection or something?

I don't remember. Memories. Basically, a bunch of memories.

We looked into a bunch of pools. Memories came out, fought us as dragons. We have to leave items behind in the pool to then find in the next life.

[Nessie]
And Monk is getting down to where he's going to have to start giving his clothes.

[Heart]
Oh no. Please don't. Oh no.

I actually can, no. To clarify, all the characters on the Brilliance Ship are now fighting basically the embodiment of our past fights, but as dragons, yeah?

[James]
Yes. Not all of them are dragons, but the default memories that you're fighting are dragons. You have the option of each pool of memories has a default fight there.

You can attempt to override it with a check of one of your own memories. The idea here is the items that you deposit there are going to show up in the next campaign at those locations. Of course, that means that those enemies have access to them.

[Heart]
It also means that you know where they are. That's true. Just so I can straighten this all out, we're fighting the embodiments of our memories.

Cool. We have to leave items there? What's up with the overriding them bit?

[James]
You leave items there to... So the reason you leave magic items there is to, in a narrative sense, is to sort of prove or tribute or pay tribute to the Well of Stars here. In a way that's going to...

Basically, it's allowing you to progress.

[Heart]
Okay. So we give our magic items to the Well of Stars. That means in order to get them again in our next timeline or whatever, we'll have to go to the location those memories happened at.

[James]
Right. And otherwise, they're just going to spawn in their normal places.

[Nessie]
We can use items from the discovered items, right? Is that what you said? I don't remember.

[James]
It's a good question.

[Nessie]
I thought you said that we could do that. Okay.

[Heart]
So just... Just presumably speaking, do they have to be magical items or just items of some significance?

[James]
No, they do have to be magical items.

[Heart]
That makes sense.

[James]
Each fight is going to be harder by virtue of having dumped magic items in the previous pool.

[Heart]
Okay. So after we defeat the memory dragon, then we dump the magic item or you dump the magic item first?

[James]
You dump the item and then you fight the dragon.

[Heart]
Oh, splendid. Okay. So yes, that does make sense to make each fight harder.

Okay, cool. Yeah, I think that's all the questions. Since they will show up where the memories were, instead of finding them, I guess, in a dungeon if you found them there, you'll find them in that location.

Cool. Alright, thank you. Yep, that's all the questions, I believe.

Alright. Grab a snack and come back. Thank you.

[Frogitha]
The last thing that I'm giving away is my... Because I need that.

[Heart]
Or I would be useless.

[Frogitha]
Your what?

[Heart]
My gun. Ah. Hm.

It's okay. I have collected quite a bit of magical items that are just sitting in my inventory.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, I think a lot of us might need to borrow. That's fine.

[Heart]
Especially Monk.

[Frogitha]
Especially who? Monk. Ah, yeah.

Okay. We don't need a naked monk running around.

[Nessie]
We really don't. Technically, he's so covered in mud and dirt, he wouldn't be able to tell.

[Frogitha]
He just swamp monsters it? Are you telling me his wiener is that small?

[Nessie]
No!

[Speaker 5]
It's a lot of dirt.

[Nessie]
I'm saying it's a lot of dirt.

[Speaker 5]
Goodness. It's not that it's small, it's that she has a massive bush that hides.

[Nessie]
Oh, okay. Right. Good lord.

It's just like, they set up a bush around it, that's what she did.

[Frogitha]
Ugh. Oh, Monk. There's a bush here, a bush there.

[Heart]
It just stresses me how unlikely it is he's had a shower in the past year.

[Nessie]
Just a little bit. I think he got dragged into the water that one time.

[James]
Yeah, he was... Yeah, during the cultist thing? That was delightful.

I chose him for... Kairos chose Monk for a reason. The reason was bullying.

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Did the game get messed up? Did the Foundry server get reset?

[James]
Uh, how so? What specific error are you dealing with?

[Speaker 5]
Well, I noticed a few. I see an old bug, which is that the attack bonus... My proficiency bonus is not being added to my Silk's Ranged Attack, which is a bug that I had fixed in an earlier iteration by adding the right kinds of proficiencies.

And, I'm noticing in my notes, I had written down the entire schedule of the buff upgrades from killing dragons and how many points I had, and that's not there. So I have no idea how many points...

[Frogitha]
Reload HP?

[James]
Yeah, because I don't know when those notes were placed or which thing you're looking at.

[Speaker 5]
I think they were there, they should have been there the last time we played. So between now and then, did the server get reset?

[James]
The server didn't get reset between now and then.

[Speaker 5]
Rolled back, okay.

[James]
Uh, did you maybe make a change to the... No, it shouldn't have made a difference if it was prototype token versus the other thing.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm looking at straight from the actor list.

[Heart]
Maybe you didn't hit save?

[Speaker 5]
I remember seeing it as the thing, and I remember fixing this bug.

[Frogitha]
What level should my character's brother be?

[James]
Make him the same level.

[Frogitha]
Oh, nice. He should be level 8, shouldn't he?

[James]
Uh, you know, sure. Actually, no, I found this elsewhere.

[Heart]
We want him to be the same level so bad. A little bit higher.

[Frogitha]
Well, no, he's... See, alright, Charis was level 8 when she started, like everybody else. And when her story started, his ended.

Yes. Oh, he's... Oh, right, oh, he's dead.

Yeah, not anymore. Standing right beside her. So we have a mental breakdown.

Alright, um... Do some importing. He's a rogue.

[Speaker 5]
Where... Where's the actual points and stuff? That tells you, like, when you upgrade.

Is that on mine? What do you mean? To know when a wakened dragon's wrath, blah blah blah, becomes a...

[James]
Uh, that would be in Discord, because that's a system that Barr created.

[Heart]
So you basically just have to replace the stats with, like, it being, um, uploaded from, what's it called again? Plutonium. Do you know, does anyone still have their magical stars and stuff?

Sure, those can also be dropped, right?

[James]
And those are components, or crafting components, so they're not really magic items. You have to... You have them for one session.

It is okay to let them go. In fact, it's even better than okay. It's necessary.

There will be no escape.

[Heart]
Alright. Alright, fine. These aren't terrible rolls, I'll keep it.

What...

[Frogitha]
What happened? Oh, I was rolling for...

[Heart]
Oh, okay. Where are you rolling for the dude, then?

[Frogitha]
Uh, my, um... Uh, character creation and campaigning.

[Heart]
Oh, neat. What class is your, uh, brother before he... Kick the bucket.

[Frogitha]
Uh, he's a rogue. He's the reason that she has three levels in Rogue.

[Heart]
Ah, that checks out. Alright. Is...

Wait, actually, question. Is he going to be alive in the next timeline, or is he still dead?

[James]
Uh, you guys will find out in the next timeline.

[Heart]
He's probably just gonna disappear. Like, uh, he's probably just gonna disappear like, um, Spider-Man and that.

[Frogitha]
Oh my god, what? No!

[James]
Oh no.

[Heart]
You're right. He disintegrates. You have him for like, five seconds and you're like, oh my god, you're alive!

And it's just like, eh, well. I don't know, she's expecting him to disappear at any moment. Well, that is very sad.

She told me he's supposed to be dead.

[Frogitha]
Fair enough. Well, I'm making these in Dungeons 11.

[Heart]
This motherfucker. Um... Was this an older sibling or a younger one?

[Frogitha]
Older? Ah.

[James]
Yeah, older works.

[Frogitha]
Alright. Dex, Strength, and Con is what I need for Rogue, right?

[Heart]
Uh, for what? Dex for being a rogue. You don't need Strength.

You don't need Strength if you are Dex-based. It would be Dex and Con mostly. They're not very spread out with their stats.

[Speaker 5]
It's possible you could use Intelligence if you need to do Investigate or other skills.

[Nessie]
I mean, Mimosa has a minus one to Intelligence and she's been fine.

[Heart]
So true. So true. Yeah, it's basically just Dex and Con.

Dump Strength. Like, straight up. You don't need it for anything.

[Nessie]
Yeah, she also has a minus one in Strength since she's been fine.

[Heart]
Alright, so I can put... Intelligence only if you need it? Yeah, Intelligence only if you need it for, like, you know...

[Nessie]
I don't know, is he an Arcane Fixture? But otherwise... Investigation is a good reason to have Intelligence, but if you can surround yourself with smart people...

[Heart]
Right, yeah, no, I don't think Intelligence is for him. Then Wisdom. Wisdom for maybe Perception stuff, or Charisma if you want him to be a great face.

[Frogitha]
Alright, so he's got 13 in Strength, 17 in Dex, 17 in Con, 11 in Intelligence.

[Nessie]
Mimosa has a 20 in Charisma. She's got a 27 in Passive Intimidation. Holy shit, nice.

She's really good with the mom voice. Oh, yeah. You.

Just a little, like, eyebrows raised, tilt head to the side, like a silent excuse me. Wait, how high did you say your Charisma was? It's full.

It's a 20. Oh, wow. I love that for you.

I know. That was 17 in Intimidation.

[Heart]
I'm going to miss having such high Intelligence, honestly.

[Nessie]
I know. You need... If you want all the Intelligence stuff, you want to say Gnome is where it's at in Cloudfinder.

[Heart]
Ah, you see, the thing is, I wanted to stick my characters to being as, you know... Yeah. Even though they're transformed as thematically similar, so I might have made some...

Well, there's also a lot of feats you can take that'll help you. That's true, that's true. But yes, I did take a bunch of mechanically unfriendly choices.

[Nessie]
Yeah, I changed Mimosa a little, too. Same with Monk. I made Monk, I think, an Earth...

pretty much like an Earth Monarchy.

[Heart]
Oh my god, that's so fitting. What did you say you made Mimosa into?

[Nessie]
I don't remember.

[Heart]
Some...

[Nessie]
we'll find out in the next episode! I think I gave her some sort of fairy thing with cold. Cool.

Yeah. That's fitting. Some cold fairy thing?

Yeah, I don't... again, I don't remember, but I gave her a thematical cold and frost. Cool, I love that.

[Heart]
Yeah. Uh, my... okay, I don't really know how to pronounce it, but, um...

The Doctor is a Yagwai? Basically, was an item, is humanoid, sort of thing. I'm gonna try to type that out.

Oh yeah. What do you need there? Hmm?

[James]
Right, it's a fallout. That's it, I wasn't gonna say it.

[Heart]
How do you pronounce words? Hell. Let me put a voiceover for that.

I'm gonna look up the pronunciation so I don't make a fool of myself next time.

[Nessie]
Otter and I are trying to figure out how to stitch together to make something like a bugbear. Yeah, that's a Yagwai. Yeah, I know that because of Fallout.

[Heart]
Thank you. Yep, I chose that because all the Fae-based things didn't really fit, especially because most of them are, like, small, so I was just like, it also fits with transformation and stuff.

[Nessie]
Oh yeah, and then I think Otter is making a... What's she joke about doing?

[Heart]
The Wish the Live one?

[Nessie]
Yes.

[Heart]
Honestly, if she does do it, that would be really, really funny. Just the implications.

[Nessie]
She is gonna do it, because she said it, she put it on the ether, and then I was like, no, don't do it, and then she went silent. Which means she's gonna do it. Well, there you go.

And then the next noise she made was a bunch of people, so...

[Heart]
Yeah, it's a done deal.

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[Heart]
You know, for the Yagwai things, when it was like, oh, you can pick an object, I was very, very tempted to make the object form a dog, but I'm just like, would that work? It would be funny. Anywho, what about the other characters?

What other Pathfinder exchanges have you done with them?

[Nessie]
All we got was Mimosa and Mung. Okay. And we started to play around with Nox as Pathfinder.

It doesn't have a bug there.

[Heart]
Yeah, it's very tragic.

[Nessie]
No customers. We had to figure out what to do with him, and then Agnes is the new one. But I did make...

There's going to be what? Easy, because she's just a wizard. Ah, yeah.

A wizard goblin, I think. That'll be easy. I did, however, make, a while ago, a giant awakened goose character.

That's a barbarian.

[Heart]
Wait, who's this?

[Nessie]
The giant goose? It's a character I made a while ago. Ah, that's amazing.

So I made it, and that means that I will be able to bring my giant goose.

[Heart]
Terrorizing the land. Yes. Fabulous.

I cannot wait. Yeah, I'm excited. All the anger of a goose, but big this time.

Mm-hmm.

[Nessie]
Yeah, over-chicken. And then Otter keeps wanting me to bring in, like, a little infamous...

[Heart]
Plate rebel.

[Nessie]
Yeah, he's a kangoo.

[Heart]
Oh, I remember seeing some text about it, how he had to sell some of his stuff.

[Nessie]
Very sad. Yeah, he was really sad. We'll see.

[Heart]
You know, with the awakened animal thing, I was thinking of making my kengu into a tengu, because that's a very easy conversion. But then I was just like, wouldn't it be fun to play as a crow, though? And I was like, hmm.

[Nessie]
I mean, he's a kangoo, but I absolutely make him bird-like. He loves his shiny things. He'll eat things he shouldn't.

My favorite thing to do is him mimicking, because we're playing in kind of a horror-type thing, so he likes to mimic all the weird, creepy noises. Ooh. His tengus mimic.

And that's why his name is Plink, because kangoo names are noises that they're used to. And he's a bartender, so it's the Plink with two glasses together. Aww.

That's the answer. Yeah, he's actually a really good bartender, a really good business person. But he did also try to steal the big statue in Heart and Trouble, but you know.

[Speaker 7]
Hello! New person who has joined in. Oh, hello, Wes!

Nope, not late. You're good.

[James]
Very nice.

[Nessie]
You haven't started yet. You're good. What'd you get?

A job.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Ooh. Nice.

What job? Bottling. So I'm just gonna be picking things up and placing them on things the whole day.

I like it. Neat.

[James]
Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, so you haven't started yet?

[Heart]
No.

[James]
I'm waiting to see if anybody else appears. I'm hoping... I know the bar didn't sign up.

I'm hoping that bar can come in here.

[Nessie]
He said he was doing something.

[Speaker 7]
Oh! Okay, cool.

[Nessie]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Heart]
Alright, last question. Are we standing or are we flying above this stuff?

[James]
Oh, you're not standing. You're flying.

[Heart]
Yeah, I think we're on the dragon. God dang it. Alright, thank you.

[James]
Oh, sorry. No, no, no. Sorry.

You are standing. You are not flying. Oh, wow.

I don't know if I said that.

[Heart]
You just said it the opposite way. Thank you.

[James]
Yeah, no, no. I think a few of you had dragons during the last fight. That's not going to persist, but you guys...

Okay. I will consider saving my work. I'll give myself a scalp massage.

Nice. Oh, Incarnate, how I love when you refuse to save my ship.

[Frogitha]
Musician's a feat? What? What's a feat?

There's a musician feat for D&D? Oh, I don't know that. Okay.

[Heart]
Oh, yeah, I had heard of this one. Pretty neat.

[Frogitha]
It's created.

[James]
Nice.

[Speaker 7]
Well done.

[Frogitha]
Are you tired?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, D&D.

[Heart]
What's up? Sorry, repeat what you said. I didn't catch the...

[Frogitha]
He said I was D&D, he said that was illegal, and then I said I ain't no stranger to illicit activities. Huh.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, boy.

[Frogitha]
Reed, I'm not a criminal. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I'm going to make myself a protein shake here while you wait.

[Heart]
Hey, Donkey.

[Speaker 9]
Hello.

[James]
Hey, good timing. Rez will be back, because I'm pretty sure Rez will be back soon, and then we will be good to go. Hello.

[Baar-Ur]
Hello, how's it going?

[Nessie]
Hmm.

[Heart]
That's really good. What's the thing about?

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, the new Dragon Age game.

[Heart]
Nice. I know nothing about Dragon Age, so I'm afraid I'm not the target audience, but that sounds incredible. I love that.

Three in three days, that's very impressive. How long are they?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, this one's just shy of 2,000, not shy of 3,000 words.

[Heart]
Wow.

[Baar-Ur]
I did another, let's see, yesterday's was 2,300, the one before that was 300.

[Heart]
Still, very, very impressive. So many words. Good job.

[Frogitha]
One, and...

[James]
Oh, that's good. Excellent, okay. There's not okay slipping back into my language again, I gotta stop that shit.

It's a, uh, it's a, I don't know, I wanna train myself out of whatever aphasia is developing and any kind of hesitation and speaking in complete sentences. I get, like, so often I'll find myself either interrupting my own sentences or getting ready to, basically, choosing a few specific words to kind of, like, spool up the rest of my brain or the rest of the thought I was having so I can catch up to the thought that interrupted my brain about two sentences ago, and now if I don't get it out I'm gonna, like, completely ruin my paragraph or my speech, my chunk of information.

And it's really annoying. It's really annoying. So I wanna train myself out of that, which means I gotta train myself out of the coping mechanism of whatever it is.

So, alright, at the beginning of all of my sentences.

[Baar-Ur]
I don't think there's anything wrong with that. You know, you are incredibly eloquent. I get so excited talking that I end up stuttering.

[James]
It's like that. But I wanna stay eloquent is the thing.

[Speaker 5]
Part of, there's a, there's a coping mechanism where you fill in blanks with filler words like um or like. That sort of thing. And it's not a problem per se.

Like, it doesn't make you a terrible person. But it does, it is a style of communication that seems more informal, that seems more extemporaneous, makes you appear less composed, less deliberate, so.

[Baar-Ur]
It is very modern.

[Speaker 5]
For instance, when I'm teaching in front of students I have to speak in a different way than I would if I was in my own, you know, office hours. And it's more important, your communication style, when it's tied to your business, your career. So if you're going to be in front of clients, if you're speaking to stakeholders, people that you need to give a good impression to, come across like you are composed, you knew exactly what you were going to say, whatever bends or twists the conversation ends up taking, it's exactly what you had in mind.

When you're trying to give that sort of impression, saying like, um, like, makes it sound like you're reaching for things.

[James]
And that is something I would like to avoid, especially given that I work in sales, so. Right now, if I'm doing that often, then it kind of seems like I'm just, like, not paying attention as much. And that's unpleasant.

Not a good place to be. That's interesting. Why does that look there?

The places I put it. You should log into Foundry. There's going to be a couple of combats.

[Speaker 7]
What, you mean you're not just giving us the epilogue?

[Nessie]
We still have so many magic items to pick up.

[Speaker 7]
I've given up all mine.

[Nessie]
Monk has, like, one before he's naked. I can, I'm sure I can just, like, shove one in your hand or something. I took the Ring of Warp from Granny Agnes, and I gave it to Monk, so he's got one more round before he's draping his clothes in.

[Heart]
I can toss in my dimensional shackles. It's fine.

[Nessie]
Oh, what level are we going to be in Pathfinder? That's a good question.

[James]
We're going to start off at level one, just to keep things simple, and so I don't accidentally begin killing people all over the place.

[Baar-Ur]
Always a good plan.

[Speaker 5]
What are the rules of setup? And are they, can you use them in the character creation application, or are there things we're going to have to add manually?

[James]
I feel like you cut out.

[Speaker 5]
My question was about if the modifications we're doing, I think there's been some talk of a mythic mode, if those are able to be implemented during character creation as selections, or if we have to create a character and then modify it in a more manual style?

[James]
It'll be, if I understand, if I'm interpreting you correctly, the mythic points and mythic feats are probably going to show up later. Just to keep things simple, we're going to start off at level one, do the level one things, and then we'll introduce mythic points probably for folks after they get past the tutorial dungeon style stuff. We're still going to use the Hidden Bluff as our tutorial dungeon.

That'll make it easier for having people run Pathfinder 2nd Edition, sourcing Pathfinder 2nd Edition DMs. That's probably the most mapped out dungeon that I have in Showmiss Valley, and with Pathfinder 2nd Edition's rules, it's a lot easier to gatekeep certain areas based on level. Not strictly, people can still get past them, but it is a lot easier to put up. There's these minor barriers that people get to opt in into a more difficult experience, by and large.

[Heart]
If you want to try out with building the character first before we even get on Foundry. Have you heard of Pathbuilder?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I've used Pathbuilder extensively in the past.

[Heart]
Well, there you go.

[James]
Errol's saving the changes. Well, I'm going to try saving it like six times until it works.

[Heart]
I know, but I realize I'm going to lose my rock collection. Very sad.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to lose all my spells.

[Heart]
Yes, that's it.

[James]
Ah, nice.

[Speaker 5]
During TF2 character creation, there's rare options, and I don't know what the higher... uncommon and rare. Are we allowed to pick any uncommon?

Some rares? Do we need to discuss with you?

[James]
We'll go over it later. Yeah, because I'm not... I wouldn't be expansive, obviously, but...

I am a little bit nervous about starting Pathbinder 2nd Edition. Off the... Huh.

[Heart]
So it's across that bridge when we get to it?

[James]
Yeah, it's like... I'm not going to commit to it in the... I'm not going to commit to it in the middle of this discussion, certainly.

Doing Lancer was totally fine for my first GMing, and I'll probably just take the same approach. Like, you guys need to know how your character abilities work. I'm going to trust that you do.

You will ask somebody who's more familiar with the character abilities when you're having an issue, unless it's like a big deal. Like, hey, we kind of need all hands on deck. That's totally fine.

Yeah, so I'm not expecting it to be a huge problem. That is it. Listen, I'm really happy that you got that job, man.

It's going to solve a lot of problems for you. Something's going on, but that's not... Why does this look so much brighter up here, but it's not the same brightness up here?

It's the same weird as shit. Oh, I'm going to export it. Alright, at 1 o'clock I'm going to take some Adderall and put some...

Well, amphetamine salts, and put a pot of coffee on. And then when I get back from that, we are going to get started. I see something's totally going on with the filters there.

No way that's not the case.

[Heart]
Okay, last question. Can I heal myself back to full, or am I still carrying the damage from two sessions ago?

[James]
What was the damage that you took two sessions ago?

[Heart]
When we went and we fought our alternate self. Okay, I fought my alternate self.

[James]
Oh, no, you're not still carrying the damage from that now.

[Heart]
Alright, thank you. Still can't believe I'm the only one who actually fought mine. Very funny, though.

[Speaker 5]
I had a session of Shadow Dark yesterday that I played in. Oh! And, uh...

It was this, like, abandoned mine adventure location. And... The map was ultra-linear.

And basically you had to do co- I've been thinking about it. About, like, were there non-combat things we could have done? And I think you just had to do combat.

And you just had to get lucky with the dice. And I was a little disappointed with that.

[Heart]
Alas. What system did you say this was?

[Speaker 5]
Shadow Dark. It's kind of like, um... Splitting the difference a bit between 5th edition and EX D&D.

From, like, 1981.

[James]
Image, go to maps. And browse. What I'll probably do is host this, uh...

I'll host this, like, world file locally. Because I'll probably just switch to doing my Lancer game with local hosting. Let's see here.

And then I'm just going to, like, completely reset the server. And switch over to Pathfinder 2nd edition for this one. Because it's probably going to have more people running in it.

Selecting players and GMs for Lancer is a little bit more difficult on the whole.

[Heart]
Is this a mount problem? Or just... What's it?

Demographic issue?

[James]
A little bit of a demographic issue. There's a lot of... Depending on which places you're sourcing Lancer players from, there's a lot of, like, bad actors that kind of traverse through the same areas.

I had a fun... I'll tell you guys about it later. But I did have a fun, like, hour-long conversation with somebody who was complaining about how Lancer GMs can be overly restrictive and stuff like that.

And I'm like, oh, that's interesting. And they're like, yeah, like, the game makes a whole bit... Makes a lot of hay about playing human characters.

But there's no, like, mechanical differences when it comes to playing human characters versus other characters. So, you know, I don't really get what the big deal is. And it's really bad for the game.

And I was like, oh, that's interesting. What kind of things are you talking about? And he's like, well, I wanted to play a Cobalt in Lancer.

I was like, what the fudge?

[Speaker 9]
I see.

[James]
I was like, oh, yeah. There's a lot of weird people here. It's probably not unique to Lancer.

Well, I know it's not unique to Lancer. But it can be a problem. When you're recruiting from the server.

Let's see. Okay. I'm off to complete my tasks.

Wonderful. Oh, somebody got far up to speed.

[Nessie]
What?

[Speaker 5]
Are you familiar with the little epilogue section that we've been doing in the past session?

[Speaker 6]
I'm not. I missed it.

[Speaker 5]
So basically, there's all these different sort of like pools of reflection. And the thought is that we're kind of like powering the setting is going to reincarnate to become based on Pathfinder 2, basically. So we're getting kind of a hard reset.

And part of that involves us depositing, selecting from our library of magic items, our inventory of magic items, and depositing, like selecting an item and depositing it in one of the pools. There's a finite number. And what that will sort of guarantee that that item will be found at the location associated with that pool.

So each pool has sort of associated location. So it's a way to kind of like bookmark the location of a particular item.

[Nessie]
Yeah. So Zephain is restarting everything to try to like stop whatever incursion is happening. And that's why we're restarting.

Okay. We'll see all of these beasties again. So the loot will be the stuff we're dropping.

If there's anything story-wise that you do not want to give up, you keep it. Because then it'll just go back to where the story was. Like Mimosa's armor and her daggers and journal from her grandma and great aunt.

I need to just leave those alone so that when everything recycles, they go back to the story point.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Baar-Ur]
But the magical items that I've crafted, I should drop?

[Nessie]
Usually. Yeah. Probably.

It's kind of a way to give us loot again, get our loot back. That's kind of...

[James]
Yeah, if you want to like provide them... If you want to put them in a place that's easier to access.

[Nessie]
Okay. Yeah.

[James]
Also a fun way for me to equip bad guys with magic items. Yeah.

[Nessie]
Yeah. And the pools, we go up to them. We think of a memory or a boss that we fought and we fight it.

And then we drop the items. If we don't like the thought, the memory that goes in, we can try to out-memory that one and cancel it out.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Nessie]
I was thinking about it like in Ghostbusters where they're like, don't think of this thing. And then they did this sweet puff marshmallow. Like it's a little bit like that.

[Baar-Ur]
All right. I'm going to need at least four. Maybe three.

[Nessie]
I think three. I think... I think this...

I think this is technically one.

[Baar-Ur]
What's happening with the dragon touch items?

[James]
Excellent question.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think anything in particular. I think they're going to get seeded like everything else. So they aren't getting dropped?

Whether they retain their current power level.

[Heart]
I believe they might, based on the fact... Maybe because it was mentioned how the points are still being applied. Possibly.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Were there any other... Well, I guess there's two questions.

One, how difficult are these items to incorporate into Pathfinder 2nd Edition?

[Nessie]
That's not our problem.

[Speaker 5]
Well, it's a problem for the guy that you got to get to say yes. You can drop this item in the pool. So to get the yes.

So there's that question. Should they even exist at all in the system that we're going into? I guess the second one is, how do you handle progressive items?

So items that have changed their state from when they were initially picked up. When they get seeded, do they go to their initial state? Or do they save the state that they were at when you deposit them?

[James]
Oh, for the most part they're going to be level appropriate to whatever critter is holding them. I did say for the most part. I'm not going to adhere super strict.

The things that spawn randomly are going to... ...that players encounter are going to be much closer to that. But your progression or your ability to progress with items is going to be significantly more enhanced.

Compared to where it was with 5th Edition. Because you can equip runes. There's a bunch of things that you can equip to it.

Like there's Dragon's Breath runes. And that's like a 4th level item.

[Nessie]
We asked questions. We brought Lara up to speed.

[James]
Excellent. To catch everybody up. We're looking at the Ballad of You.

Which Soul Regineer has delivered this information onto the party. To let them know that Zephain is constructing a ballad based on the players. And as close to where he has been in secret.

And as close to completing it. He's not going to be able to recover his mind on his own. Which means something on the order of 1,200 Shivagroths are going to...

Something on the order of 1,200 Shivagroths... Sorry, no. 2,400 Shivagroths are going to be spawning in the valley.

And something on the order of 250 of those are going to reach full size. So with 250 critters of gargantuan size. Oh, those are the things that are...

Do you remember... I don't know which sessions you were in. But it's like a large spider crab aberration.

And by large I mean gargantuan. It has hundreds of heads. It sings a song of madness.

As it walks about. And they're pretty difficult to kill. Mostly because they have an easier time killing things quickly.

They have hundreds of mouths.

[Nessie]
Zephain was possessed by one?

[James]
Driven insane. He entered a pact with one and started losing his mind. Somewhat unwillingly.

This happens with aberrations. But yeah, so each one of the frost-covered hexes is going to generate one of these Shivagroths. And they're going to begin eating one another in order to grow to full size.

Which leaves about 250 of them. They have 250 critters of like CR 20 or higher. That will begin just attempting to devour the valley.

And not all of them are going to live, right? They're not completely invincible. It's just...

That's... if you spend... I don't know if you spend like two or...

If you spend an army killing like let's say two of them. Then you got 248 to go. So it's definitely an end state.

So he's using the Ballad of You to kind of reverse time in the valley. That's going to come with some... It's kind of spaghetti-coated magic.

So it's going to have some weird effects. And it's going to change how things work in a way that's a little bit... That's more conducive to letting the players...

You... To letting you achieve total victory in the valley. The point of the Pool of Reflections here...

Are to gain entry into the Well of Stars. Because your final objective, which was... Depositing the lieutenant of...

You remember Old Scratch, right? The necromancer. He had an assistant referred to as the Assassin.

Just the lieutenant of Old Scratch. Sometimes took the form of a young girl. And you folks decided, hey, we're going to fix her.

We're going to look for means of fixing her. So Brashear informed you, you could perform a naming ritual... At this Well of Stars to reverse her...

Physical damage and mental damage. And just transform her into a normal girl. And this is going to...

I mean, you guys will succeed, so there's going to be some... I don't know, she's going to be immune to the Ballad of You. Because she's going to be in this place.

And she's not going to end up... Her state is not going to end up reversing. Because she'll be in this Well.

Nice, and Otter just finished. So that brings us to here. Go ahead and add yourself to the initiative bar.

What we'll do is we'll finish the combat... With the Adult Lamethys Dragon. Yes.

You are in the middle of combat. You have Nadia.

[Heart]
Should I also roll for initiative?

[James]
Right, right. Alright, with everybody there... Alright, so pairs...

Three. Yeah, fuck it, let's get started now. Monk.

This is the Adult Lamethys Dragon that was present from... Oh, Ben, you weren't here for this session. But this was the Adult Lamethys Dragon that was present at...

Celial's Spire. When the party went to... Before Celial was, quote, born.

This is the dragon that was dogfighting with the players... As they were riding white dragons. Young white dragons.

Not sentient ones.

[Nessie]
Oh, okay, I forgot about that. Can't wait until Flurry of Bows is in the action.

[James]
Uh-huh.

[Nessie]
Is it... I have to do my action first with a bonus attack, or does it matter?

[James]
You can't... I mean, if you do your action first, it's going to be easier for us.

[Nessie]
Okay. Action first. Oh, no.

Okie-dokie, then.

[James]
I think you had a second attack with the...

[Nessie]
Oh, I do. I do. I'm sorry.

[James]
Aha! Very good. All right, that brings us to Corpus.

You got rid of the Staff of Striking and your Dragonhide Belt. And I think the Ring of Fire Resistance. Very good.

It is applying... It's still applying your Dragonhide Belt. So I'm going to add...

What is that? Four attacks. I'll add eight.

But besides that, you are finished, I presume. Ah, I see. All right, and Para is next.

So she will probably get here before the end of the round. So I'm going to skip to Mimosa after I take a Legendary action. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

Ionic. Oh, that shit sucks. Okay.

I'll go for you over there. All righty, Monk, Corpus, Mimosa, and Glimmer. This is funny.

I'm hitting the three people who all have Evasion. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Is the Dragon still under my control? Oh. From...

I had used the Staff of Command on it.

[James]
Okay, and what was the...

[Speaker 5]
I think it gets a saving throw every round, though. Because I think I had told it to eat its rider.

[James]
Right.

[Speaker 5]
On the last round.

[James]
It's been hit, like, eight times since then. Does that make sense?

[Frogitha]
Is she even on the Dragon? Does she need to be?

[James]
Ah, that's a good point. She doesn't need to be. She could just be flying.

[Frogitha]
Okay, so would she be hit if she was right here?

[James]
Uh, yeah. Let's keep it simple. We're assuming that she is on it.

[Frogitha]
Okay, she can be on it for now, and then I'll get off the drum.

[James]
Right. Okay, uh, 19. Just 19 damage.

And Mimosa gets to half it, Monk and Corpus take nothing. And then we move on to Mimosa.

[Nessie]
Man, these are only 0 right now, right?

[James]
That is correct.

[Nessie]
Okay.

[James]
Oh, jeez.

[Nessie]
Hang on.

[James]
Dead. How do you want to do this?

[Nessie]
Oh, I'm going to miss her so much. She probably goes from, like, the open of the mouth and then down the throat. When you say, like, open.

[James]
Nice. As the dragon fades, you see a bunch of guts spill out as you fillet this thing, along with an egg. And they all just, like, drop.

They drop into the mercury pool and fade away. Oh, this is the amethyst dragon that Sierra's amethyst dragon came from. Close that.

Next. So, I'm going to end the combat here. I shall delete him, and I'll delete the white dragons as well.

This is some fun callback. But Mimosa—not Mimosa. Pera was the only character there that was, like, there.

Which is kind of funny. It was, like, March 2023, according to my last session reports, I think. Oh, Landy was there as well.

Rana wasn't there. That was Sierra? That might have been—no, that was Sierra and Maya.

That's where the meme of Maya getting captured all the time began. All right, so there are two pools left in this area. And you can see a portal to the north growing in, like, solidity.

Growing stronger over time. As each of these are completed.

[Speaker 5]
It looks like we have top left and maybe the bottom— Top left and bottom left.

[James]
That is correct.

[Frogitha]
I would send heart to this one.

[James]
Who would like to go for—who would like to see what kind of memory pops up?

[Speaker 7]
I would.

[James]
And which character do you have?

[Heart]
I've got a jingle potion. Right, does anyone need, like, extra magic items? I should just hand you, running out?

[Speaker 7]
I can.

[Nessie]
Okay. Does anyone have healing? Monk has one left.

[Frogitha]
Corpus isn't looking too well, Mimosa's not looking too well, Monk is not looking too well, and Aeris is not looking too well.

[Heart]
The most healing I could do is, like, making you use your hit die for healing, but that's about it.

[Nessie]
We could take a short rest. That would be all right. That would let us use our dice.

Could we do a short rest?

[James]
Absolutely. Okay.

[Frogitha]
I think that's a great idea.

[James]
Sol Brasier will come over to spend his hit dice after Mimosa's beating earlier.

[Heart]
All right, so, how many people needed magical items again?

[Nessie]
How many more portals do we have left to do?

[James]
Two at this place.

[Nessie]
Two at this place.

[James]
And then there will be two afterward.

[Nessie]
Okay, so four.

[Heart]
Okay, let me count my magic items and see how many I can give easily.

[James]
Let's see. I'm also going to pull up Astral Tide so I can describe this place again.

[Heart]
Three. Four.

[James]
I wish I had my physical colleague with me.

[Nessie]
All right, so I have... Hey, you missed pretty much nothing. We're at a new pool.

We're taking a short rest, I suppose.

[Heart]
All right, so I have five that are easily given away. I don't know if some of these count, but... There we go.

I can give you an extra one just for now. Wait, no, hold on. There's some I want to shove also into the portal.

Hold on. Six, I guess.

[James]
I can hear you.

[Nessie]
Oh, yeah. I thought I was muted for some reason. You said we could donate memories instead of magical items?

Is that what you said?

[James]
I didn't define that super well. No. That was an idea.

Like, I don't know how to define that in terms of Pathfinder. I know how I would implement that in 5th edition. I don't know how I would implement it in Pathfinder 2nd edition is the trouble.

[Speaker 6]
How would you implement it in 5e?

[James]
In 5e, you would just have a lot of penalties while you were in the location because a memory had been taken from you. It would be a lot similar... It would be similar to how I ruled your character interactions while you folks were in the haunts, for instance.

Like you'd be making decisions and facing contextual penalties.

[Speaker 6]
In Pathfinder, there's a thing called a Circumstance Bonus or a Circumstance Penalty. I would say that would be it because that would basically be the same thing. It would be either a minus 1 or a minus 2, depending on how severe you think it should be.

Can't go more than 2. Yeah. Sometimes they do have Circumstance Penalties of like 5, but that's if you really want to punish someone for doing something silly.

Dude, you need to stay over there right now. Please.

[James]
That's kind of how bad I think of it as being, however. A minus 5 penalty in Pathfinder 2nd edition is like you're sort of doubling your chance, especially at low levels, of getting a crit fail and sort of guaranteeing at the very least a normal fail.

[Nessie]
Yes. I guess depending on the level we all want to get there, it'd be 1 if we're higher or 2 or 3.

[James]
Yeah, so basically I would hate to make somebody make a decision like, I don't want to go with that because I don't want somebody to make a decision here that in several months down the line is going to result in super character death or something like that. If that's how a game is structured from the outset and is kind of handled normally for everything, then that's certainly fine, right? I don't mind level limits in a game where your elf is likely to die before they get to 7th level anyways.

In this context, I would find it somewhat unfair.

[Speaker 6]
So what was the Crystal Dragon?

[Nessie]
An Amethyst. Oh, we're still talking about the Pit Fiend Cult. Where does this portal lead to before I toss an item in?

[James]
No, that one wasn't the Pit Fiend Cult, that guy was already...

[Speaker 6]
That was Salial Spire, right?

[James]
That was Salial Spire, that's correct.

[Nessie]
It was Salial Spire, we just fought it over here. Oh, I thought we had already decided... Okay.

[Speaker 6]
We had already defeated that, but that's okay.

[James]
You still get to, if you would like, you get to do a memory that... Keep going? It did.

Okay. You still get to choose a... or attempt to force a memory over whatever has been...

You still get to try to force a memory over whatever has been chosen as the default for the pool.

[Speaker 6]
Can we send more than one item?

[James]
No.

[Nessie]
If you want to get rid of more than one, the monks of the party have next to nothing. I joked that a monk would have to throw in his robes next, and for some reason people didn't like that.

[James]
Well, no, that's one way of doing it, is if you choose other stuff to... Yeah, if you spread the items around, have somebody else throw an item in. That's a totally legal way of doing it.

It just means that person is not contributing an item of their own, which, if they didn't have an item of their own to contribute that time, that's functionally... You know? No harm, no foul.

Let me scroll back up to you. There you are.

[Heart]
Functionally, I have four that I can give up, if anyone needs the extras.

[Frogitha]
See, I don't know where this pool is going. I'm a little nervous.

[Heart]
That's fair, you don't have to give...

[James]
I think you guys already ditched your stuff into Salial Spire.

[Nessie]
Yeah, we're going over here.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, can we know where this is going?

[Speaker 6]
It's our place, our memory. Yeah, I don't think this one's active yet, it doesn't look like...

[James]
Corpus, if you go over there, nothing appears, because the dragon that would have been used for Corpus has already appeared.

[Nessie]
I can stick my head in it. We can fight... What was the thing that we had to fight at the pyramid?

That Mimosa's... Oh, the other Shivagroth? Oh, the mummy Shivagroth.

Yeah, let's... We can fight that.

[Heart]
No. Yeah, okay, we could.

[Nessie]
Yeah. Okay. Boom.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, you don't want me going over there, because the only dragon I can think of left... I don't know if we could fight, even. Which one?

You guys wouldn't know, because I was the only one left in the entire campaign that was there.

[Nessie]
Oh, wow.

[Speaker 6]
But it was the one that I'm always thinking about, where we went to the Corrupted Sun Shrine, and there was a Dracolich. Yes. It was huge, and it looked down at us.

I don't think we could have fight that.

[Nessie]
I mean, maybe we could, but I don't want to risk it. I mean, it gets Hera to 20. All right.

[James]
Mimosa, choose an Insight or an Arcana check, or something else that you feel is appropriate to memory. To kind of force your... It's going to be a DC 15.

And the goal here is to force your vision and your memory into this pool.

[Nessie]
I love that the 5e sheet, you go to click on it, and it pops up with the info thing. Cool, 26. Oh, yeah.

I forgot. I'm going to take my short rest first.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah. You guys are short resting. Should I do a healing?

Do I have a healing?

[Nessie]
We're short resting 2 heals, so you can wait. Yeah, save it for later.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Frogitha]
All of mine are going, too. Oh, I just wasted one. Whoops.

I'm going to give myself that one back, if I am able to. Am I not able to? Hold on.

Because that one was a complete waste.

[Nessie]
Whatever. We're short resting, and Mimosa's memory is the mummified Shivagraha. That's her ancestors.

So where is this going to end up? Somewhere here.

[James]
Indeed. Mimosa, what was your roll?

[Nessie]
26.

[James]
Ah, okay. So you did succeed. So why can't I hear that?

[Nessie]
If I smack dab in the middle of Arbus' hit dice...

[Speaker 6]
Whoa! Don't worry about it.

[Nessie]
Oh, okay. If it's from Parra, that's okay.

[Heart]
Don't worry about it. I am much too worried about it.

[Nessie]
It's from Parra. It's okay. We don't need to worry about it.

Oh, it's blended.

[James]
This is going to be a very interesting fight. The good news is, Parra is going to level up to 20 after this fight immediately, so get ready for that.

[Nessie]
Hell yeah, I'm so excited.

[James]
Because it's worth 75,000 XP.

[Frogitha]
Oh, that's disgusting. What have you done?

[Heart]
Wait, Parra, doesn't that mean your thing just works as will? Divine intervention?

[James]
Yes, that is what that means. So, what are you guys... What are you guys contributing to the pool before you fight this thing?

[Heart]
Myself?

[James]
Myself.

[Heart]
I will toss in my broom. Oh, do we toss our things in before the thing shows up?

[James]
Yeah.

[Heart]
Also, again, if you guys need things, just pick.

[James]
Not a bad idea. You do have a chance to attune to new things, by the way, if you're worried about that, if you're swapping in and out. And the other thing is, you'll...

Wow, so that place is going to be fucking chock full of magic items, which I'm fine with. What I want you to do is, I want you to draw on the map, or not draw, use the... Use the drawing tools to put text on the map that indicates what you're throwing in.

I will type in Minosa's Tower.

[Speaker 6]
Mine are all pink, because you can color code them.

[Nessie]
And I'm the only one who did that.

[Frogitha]
I didn't realize you could. Minosa's Tower, that's Minosa's grandmother's tower, right? Indeed.

Man, I'm, like, considering dropping my... Dropping my gun there. But then that'll leave me with, like, just spells.

And my useless brother.

[Baar-Ur]
Can you use a plus one rapier?

[Frogitha]
I can, I can. You can have it.

[James]
Okay, okay. Thank you. If you want to, you can also put in the plus one rapier.

Like, you are allowed to give each other items to toss in.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, I'm trying to think ahead, though. Like, I'm trying to think ahead of, for, like... So it's not too...

I don't know, I want to know where I put my gun.

[James]
Where you put your gun, yeah. Because otherwise you have to go back up to space in order to get that thing back.

[Frogitha]
Exactly, and it's not even, like, I had to wait a while for it to even turn into a gun. Because it was a rock, it was a space rock.

[James]
That's right, it was a rock.

[Heart]
Does... so, everyone's good with their items? Because, again, I have a list of stuff.

Do you have any healing items?

[James]
Oh, Lord of the Healer.

[Heart]
Uh, well, I have a circlet of lasting you can use. Otherwise, no, no extra.

[Baar-Ur]
If you want more spells, I can give you warlock spells.

[Frogitha]
Ooh. Okay. That might...

yeah. Alright, I'm gonna drop... oh my god, this is such a bad idea.

[Heart]
I'm... This circlet of blessing also gives you funky stuff. Well, one spell.

But, it's a spell.

[Frogitha]
Okay, I think I'm gonna drop my gun here. Ugh, I'm gonna die.

[Speaker 9]
Do it!

[Heart]
There, there.

[Frogitha]
Alright. Aww. Goodbye, my beautiful gun.

I'm just gonna give it a little kiss before tossing it in. Aww. This hurts my American soul.

[James]
For real.

[Frogitha]
I will find you again, my friend. Thank you! I will need to look at that.

[Heart]
What creatures were in your tower again? Huh?

[James]
Mummies.

[Heart]
Right. Okay, so, theoretically speaking, if I tossed my grimoire in there instead, they... Would they be able to cast...

did any of them cast spells?

[James]
Mummies? Casting spells? Oh, yeah.

[Nessie]
I... okay. Ahh.

[Heart]
Okay, so I could... I could either give them the power of flight, or give them the ability to hit us harder. That's fun.

Well, I don't need to fly that bad. I'll throw my grimoire in there instead. Okay.

[Frogitha]
Um, how do I add the warlock stuff? What do I do with that?

[James]
Good question. Uh, I would just import the spells, uh, chironotype some spells that you have access to, and then Charis can import those features using plutonium. You just wouldn't import levels.

If you did plutonium import, then you would import spells, and you wouldn't expand resources in order to cast them, and you would do the same thing with class... class and subclass features, rather than... Yeah, class and subclass features, rather than the other stuff.

Oh yeah, a bunch of you are going to level up after this fight, which means we gotta do it soon, because I have until 5... I have about... until about 5pm my time, which is 3 hours 15 minutes.

Indeed, everybody added yourselves to the initiative.

[Nessie]
Uh, what the hell?

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god! She only has 3 and a 5!

[Frogitha]
Ouch. So hold up, what was the huntsman lair? Huntsman's lair.

[James]
That's where your brother died.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, that's in the Feywild.

[James]
It is!

[Frogitha]
Oh my god. Oh no, I'm first? Um...

[Baar-Ur]
I'm typing as fast as I can!

[Frogitha]
You're good, you're good. I'm gonna just use a spell of mine first.

[James]
Um... Remember, you can cast more than one spell at a time at the prison.

[Nessie]
Because we're getting closer to that.

[James]
Because we're getting closer and closer to Pathfinder 2nd Edition rules.

[Nessie]
And depending on how many actions a spell is, you can cast two.

[Frogitha]
Does anyone know what this thing uses for its attacks and stuff?

[Speaker 6]
Strength, probably.

[Frogitha]
There you go.

[Heart]
Did not mean to click that.

[Frogitha]
That is a lot.

[Baar-Ur]
And that's just the stuff that is useful in combat and does damage.

[Nessie]
Oh, that'd be pointless.

[Frogitha]
Um... Trying to see which of my spells...

[James]
Do you want to let Monk go first? Because both of you have...

[Nessie]
Yeah, because I promise you, Monk... Okay, is this thing on the ground?

[James]
Yes.

[Nessie]
I hit, so this guy... Do I need to attack, attack, and then damage, damage?

[James]
Yeah, that's fine. Get my homebrew thing. Okay, what'd you get?

Very good. Fine.

[Nessie]
Oh, that's fine.

[James]
He's not worried about that. He's only close to... Oh, because he's mummified.

That's correct. Alright, Charis, what have you got for us?

[Frogitha]
I'm just going to do... Heroism on... Ignore that.

Okay, so...

[James]
Move our boy off the map here.

[Frogitha]
So, for level four, Heroism...

[Speaker 6]
Because it's one creature, and then plus one each spell slot, so four.

[Frogitha]
Actually, we'll do Monk, because I'm going to do In Order. We'll do Monk, Hera, Dr. Bashia, and Corpus.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, plus five.

[Frogitha]
It ain't much, but it's something. Thank you. Got Bravery.

And you said I can do another spell or something?

[James]
You can. In the meantime, I'm just checking people for... Bites.

[Nessie]
Bites?

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah.

[Nessie]
Yeah, this thing looks pretty nasty.

[James]
Ooh, I could get Para in there. I just have to move this, uh... Ooh, Mimosa just out of there.

[Speaker 9]
What are you going to do?

[James]
What have you got for bonus action? We gotta speed this along.

[Frogitha]
Alright, we've got a pattern.

[James]
Sure will be fine, but... What the fuck? Wait, no, I'm immune to Charmed.

I'm immune to Charmed, Frightened, and Poisoned. We have more spells now, though. I'm just happy it doesn't have these other features for you guys.

[Nessie]
Is it also because none of us were talking to Ozzy? He's got Mom's voice on him.

[Speaker 7]
Guys, we gotta rush this along. I'll be right back.

[Nessie]
Guys, we need to hurry. I'll be right back.

[Speaker 6]
I'm only antsy because my turn is next, and I already know what I'm going to do. Yeah. Except I have to know if I survive, so...

[James]
Sorry for the interruption. It's very important that I make fun of my girlfriend for leaving, uh... ...juice or something on the counter. Alright, anything else in your turn, Charis? Nope. Okay.

Now, this critter has a feature called Head Loss. Inspired by AD&D First Edition, you can attempt to fend off the Shivagroth as an attack of opportunity. If your attack deals more than 10 damage, then the Shivagroth loses a head, which prevents it from...

Come on. Now, do you have the feat that lets you make spell attacks as an attack of opportunity? I think I do.

I do. War Caster.

[Baar-Ur]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
I guess when I had War Caster... What? Oh, yes, I do.

Take that. Oh, I didn't know I had the ability to cast a spell at him.

[James]
Oh, holy shit.

[Speaker 6]
Now, with War Caster, does it have to be a cantrip?

[James]
It has to be a spell that targets only it.

[Speaker 5]
So you can't Fireball, for instance.

[Baar-Ur]
Do I only get one Blast?

[James]
Well, technically you can Fireball, provided it only targets that creature. Elixir Blast does four Blasts, so... I don't think that you have the D6 on there, because there's only a...

Because you haven't cast Hunter's Mark on him yet. Right?

[Speaker 6]
That is correct.

[James]
Or Hex.

[Speaker 6]
So if I'm only hitting him, I can Sunburst?

[James]
17. Technically, it's 27. I still lose it.

[Baar-Ur]
For the 7 Warlock, which is...

[James]
You cantrip scale with character level. And remember, you count as, like, for your spellcasting, for both of your... Like, you count as your total character level.

So what are you? You're level 12? Right, so you are a level 12 Ranger and a level 12 Warlock for the sake of your spellcasting, anyways.

Yeah. That's probably actually going to be easier to express in Pathfinder second edition. I was looking at that.

[Frogitha]
I'm just doing spells because I don't know what subclass features to add. Might be nerfing me here.

[Speaker 5]
Who all is being subjected to the attacks?

[James]
Everybody except Mimosa. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I know. That only happens once. Oh, I already burned all my 5th level slots.

[Frogitha]
So what do I do? Oh, okay. I do an attack?

[James]
You get an attack of opportunity. Very good. 11 would miss, unfortunately.

I think you had Kibi the last time you were fighting this thing.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, you did.

[Frogitha]
Wait, is it just melee?

[James]
It is just melee, unless you have Warcaster, which lets you cast a spell.

[Nessie]
Oh shit, Monk is in there. It's fine. We'll dodge it.

Yeah, but I kept the target only hit. I'm guessing a 12 also misses. Oh, yeah.

[James]
12 just misses.

[Speaker 6]
Could we have it roll a constitution? At disadvantage because it's mummy, right?

[James]
It is mummified. Oh, I just barely fail. I did not have...

That's a really good thing that you did, because this thing does not have blindsight.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it doesn't?

[James]
No.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, because it's like 50% eyes. I forgot about that.

[James]
The other 50% is mouth.

[Speaker 6]
Kibi?

[James]
Some of you might not go down.

[Baar-Ur]
49% eyes, 50% mouth, 1% legs.

[James]
Yeah, 1% legs.

[Speaker 6]
No, it's 50% legs, 50% eyes, 50% mouth.

[Speaker 9]
Huh. We'll see.

[Speaker 7]
What were those ratios you said? The waving is...

[Nessie]
Corpus, you need to...

[James]
Corpus, you're running out of time to roll your attack of opportunity.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, my dad just got one. That's fine.

[Speaker 7]
I'll grab my attack.

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[James]
Nice, it does deal. Max damage. Minus additional 10.

Okay. Alright, I think that's everybody, so time to begin making attacks. Did I miss any adjudications?

He succeeded the wisdom save against the bestow curse. Yep.

[Speaker 6]
But he is blinded.

[James]
He is now blinded. All of you are still within reach, though. Alright, so...

Against... My Rona, I can only make three attacks. But against the rest of you, I get to make four.

[Nessie]
Is that going to be the Pathfinder creeping in?

[James]
No, this is just how it works normally. And the mummy, to be clear, is a nerfed... Because it's mummified, it's technically a nerfed version of the...

[Speaker 6]
Oh, sorry, buddy.

[James]
...of the regular Shiver Draw.

[Frogitha]
So we're all grappled?

[Speaker 5]
Depends on how many attacks hit you. Oh, I rolled a natural one.

[Nessie]
Huzzah!

[Frogitha]
Can one of his heads fall off? Just for, you know, funsies.

[James]
Two attacks, and then... Okay, so, so far... Well, we're in.

Let's see here... I want all of you to take note of who got hit there. We rolled damage twice.

[Speaker 5]
If you, um... Remember, if you did an attack of opportunity, you don't have a reaction with which to cast shield.

[Heart]
But you see, I didn't, because I don't have Forecaster.

[Speaker 5]
Aha!

[James]
Alright, so that was 18... That was 18 and then 16 for damage. Now we'll remove...

Corpus from targeting, and Kyrona, and Para from targeting... To roll a third attack. Make sure, make sure you're blocking your damage.

Oh, is Corpus just, like, flat-out resistant to piercing damage, or...? Uh, I should still be raging, that's why.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
No, I'm not.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, goodness. It actually hit me.

[Speaker 7]
I'm not resistant, because I'm not raging.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, hold on. Oh, it's still attacking with disadvantage, though, right?

[James]
No, you're right, you're right. Alright, attack... That's correct.

Give me just a second, because now... Alright, I rolled a natural 1 again, so that third one doesn't hit. Those of you who were hit twice, though, are grappled.

[Speaker 6]
Which I think would be everyone except for...

[Frogitha]
I mean, I healed it. So we take both the 16 and the 18 damage?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no, Corpus also wouldn't be, because he also missed.

[James]
Yes, if you did, uh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Well, undead are usually immune to psychic, right?

[Heart]
No, no, the 14 doesn't count, because with disadvantage they missed. Oh.

[James]
Yeah, the very last attack missed. Um, so, that's Kerris going on. Uh, you're all grappled.

Uh, I guess Glimmer is grappled. Uh, did I miss any attacks versus Kyrona? I did not.

So Kyrona also grappled.

[Speaker 6]
16 and 18 are going to be... ...hard for me.

[James]
Alright, who is after the Shippogroth while I start moving you people?

[Speaker 5]
Farrah.

[Speaker 6]
I am. What can I do when grappled? I don't remember.

[James]
Uh, you can attempt to escape with a DC... You're currently, uh, restrained, and you can escape with a DC 23 strength check. Strength?

[Frogitha]
I'm so glad Melosa is not caught up in this. I know.

[Speaker 6]
Farrah is also not strong. Um, so I guess, I don't think I can even make that, so, um... Uh, can I attack it instead?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Bite it. Farrah doesn't have bite. Uh, risk eight.

It was biting me.

[Speaker 7]
Where's this music coming from?

[James]
I've heard this before. Put it in the chat. It is also...

Yeah, it's destiny. Get a new bolt. You have to make that with disadvantage, unless you have head damage or something else.

[Speaker 6]
Is it... Is it disadvantage?

[James]
Um... You're being restrained. That still hits.

Oh, I guess it would be a normal attack, because he's blinded.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[James]
See, is that normal? Yeah. Yeah, no, you're fine.

So, and it would hit either way, so you're good to go. All right, bonus action.

[Speaker 6]
Um, bonus action, I'm going to... Who is the lowest? I can only see, like, some people's health, because people don't do that for me.

[James]
If you hover, most of them are on hover. I think everybody except Larah.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, Heart also doesn't have hover, and I can't see Monk, because he's under the big bad today.

[Nessie]
Oh, I thought mine was on hover. I did. I did.

Yeah, no, it's hovered by anyone. Don't worry about mine. Yeah, I don't see yours.

Really?

[Speaker 6]
Huh.

[Nessie]
Well, I'm fine regardless.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, let's see, bonus action. Oh, I could do this. Um, have I used any third-level spells?

I have. I'm just going to use my hardest divine power. I'll get myself a third-level slot.

[James]
That's fine. Dr. Basher.

[Heart]
Oh, yay. Right, um... We're going to hope this works, and we are going to...

Where is it? There it is. I'm going to...

I'm going to large reduce it. Make it a bit smaller.

[James]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
And then...

[Heart]
That's so rude. Do you get your reaction back at the beginning of your turn?

[James]
At the beginning of your turn, that's correct.

[Heart]
Cool, cool. I'm going to just, um... Where is...

There, barbs. Just rolled the saving throw again.

[James]
Sorry, what? Oh, silvery barbs. Okay, I cast that in the thing.

As it goes, you have until the beginning of your turn to continue changing spells.

[Heart]
I just did... Okay, anyway. Um, we are...

Oh, there it is.

[James]
It didn't pop up for me for a second.

[Heart]
Okay, and we're going to just aim at the feet so it doesn't blast everyone who's grappled by it.

[James]
So what you can do is you can cast a leveled spell, a bonus, if it's like a bonus action.

[Heart]
Ah, okay, I don't have any of those. Nevermind then.

[James]
It's a constitution save again. Okay, normal.

[Heart]
Ignore the static then.

[James]
Still good.

[Heart]
Like, well, that doesn't strike. Oh, wait, it's constitution and I'm touching it.

[Speaker 6]
Um, so what if I use my...

[James]
Are you within ten feet though?

[Speaker 6]
It's... I'm touching it.

[James]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, that's fine. It's touching me.

[James]
Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. I was wrong.

You're correct. Alright, how many dice are you spending?

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to spend three dice.

[James]
Okay. If you get above a two on any of these then... Fail.

Yeah. Okay, he's been reduced to huge size.

[Heart]
Cool. And then, since you said it has to be a regular spell, I'm just going to hop away a little. So it doesn't blink to me.

[James]
That's far enough. That's fair.

[Heart]
Yeah.

[Frogitha]
I don't like the grapple icon.

[Heart]
Yep, and that will be my turn.

[James]
Very good. Corpus!

[Speaker 7]
Alright, I need to rage one piece left.

[James]
Did I miss you earlier? No, I did hit you twice. No, I didn't.

I missed you once.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, you're good.

[James]
Remember, your bonus for the Dragonhide Belt is still on. Do you equip that?

[Speaker 7]
I think that's my rage.

[James]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
If you're sure. I'm on positive. The Dragonhide Belt on the effect still can be difficult to check.

[Speaker 5]
You can just unequip it, right? There's a plus two bonus, but...

[James]
Yeah, so... Alright, and your bonus action.

[Speaker 7]
I'll raise that to rage, but I'm going to... Because I hit twice, I'm going to squish, stun, and strike. That's not right.

[James]
Before that, I'm going to use the Legendary Reaction. Can somebody make me a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw, please?

[Speaker 5]
DC 23...

[Nessie]
Everybody vote A.

[Speaker 5]
I can't. I can't succeed even on a nat 20. Oh no, I could.

[Frogitha]
DC 23, okay.

[James]
I'm going to import his... It's Wisdom.

[Frogitha]
Wisdom, okay.

[James]
I'm going to import the Confusion spell for him, so I can just put that in the chat. Alright, you get to continue hitting it. And I need to make a...

I need to make a check versus stunned, correct? Res. Yes.

I need to do something versus stunned, right?

[Speaker 7]
Yes, versus stunned.

[James]
Okay. Those of you who succeeded take 20 damage. Psychic damage.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I failed.

[Frogitha]
And the people who failed?

[Speaker 5]
Are confused.

[James]
Are confused.

[Speaker 7]
Wow, it's actually stunned. That's crazy.

[Speaker 6]
Get off my keyboard.

[Speaker 7]
Guys, I stunned the thing.

[Speaker 6]
It is under the thing. Nice. Stunned it.

[James]
Wait, what's my saving throw? That did not apply the... Hold on a second.

It's supposed to be a plus 16. So what's going on here?

[Frogitha]
Ignore that.

[James]
It's not applying proficiency bonus.

[Speaker 7]
It has more?

[James]
Yeah, it's supposed to have proficiency, at least. Okay, would a 22 succeed?

[Speaker 7]
Uh, yes.

[James]
Unless... Aha!

[Speaker 7]
Alright, well...

[James]
Yes, okay, now it is back to stunned. We're good.

[Nessie]
Do I roll on the table to see how I'm confused?

[James]
Or... Uh, yes. Okay.

Alright, so... Corpus, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[James]
It's a random creature within reach. Alright, Mimosa.

[Speaker 6]
Uh...

[James]
Roll a d6. A 1 or 2 will be the, uh... Roll a d6, a 1 or 2 will be the Shipperdroth.

Otherwise, we'll just go... Clockwise. Creatures within reach.

So, 3, 4, 5. Oh no, Siren! Go ahead and make a melee attack against Siren.

With advantage, he's restrained.

[Nessie]
Oh... I am so... Sorry, Froggypuff.

[Speaker 9]
What...

[Nessie]
What happened?

[Speaker 6]
Mimosa has to kill the brother.

[Nessie]
Yeah. Uh-oh. What?

I rolled a d4 to see which, um, dagger she would use. Black Ring? You motherfucker.

Oh my god. So there's technically some of her allies within, um... Uh, 5 feet.

Why? Why? Like, technically, technically...

[Speaker 7]
Wait.

[Speaker 5]
No, that... The allies... The allies have to be threatening.

And they're not threatening.

[James]
You also don't have any allies within 5 feet, actually. Because they're not... Because they're all fucking...

Because you're confused. That's great, because you know how many hit points Siren has.

[Speaker 6]
He's got 30...

[Heart]
Oh my god. Please, Louise, man.

[Nessie]
What hit point left? The good news is I can only... I can only make one attack.

He had 33 hit points. What?

[Speaker 6]
That's crazy. You saw how much hit points she did earlier. Jesus Christ.

That was so fucking close.

[James]
You were about to lose it.

[Frogitha]
I was gonna traumatize her all over again.

[James]
You just got your brother back, too.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, at that point she was gonna... At that point she was just gonna be like, Alright, you know what? I'm sacrificing my memory of my brother.

[James]
Alright, Lirian, what have you got, buddy?

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna have to roll a 1d... Well, first I gotta roll the, um... Saving throw, right?

At the beginning of my turn?

[James]
At the... At the end of each of your turns, so... I just...

Got a 7.

[Speaker 5]
Is the description incorrect?

[James]
I think it says, At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats a save, ending this Bellum a success.

[Speaker 5]
Right. What the Shivagroth says... What Shivagroth says is creatures who fail can repeat the save at the beginning of each of their turns.

[James]
You are correct.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's a Wisdom Ability check. 14. 14.

Fail. So still confused.

[Nessie]
Oh, like, roll to get out of confusion?

[Speaker 5]
1d10... A 1...

[James]
Remember, you guys are still under the effects of the Heroism spell. Those of you who are Heroism'd.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I have to roll a d8 to determine direction. You just go counter-clockwise from north, so 7 is... northwest?

No, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Directly west. Uh...

[James]
That's a shame. I got a legendary faction for this, or legendary reaction, but I am stunned. Also, everybody mark yourselves as, like, plus one in elevation, but yeah.

Kyrona! At the beginning of your turn, go ahead and make me a Wisdom save. That would fail.

[Speaker 6]
I can't believe... I can't believe you didn't die. Holy shit.

Bar, you sound like you're 40 years away. Oh my god!

[Baar-Ur]
Sorry, I had my mic up. Um, I rolled the d10 for what happens in the confusion earlier, and I got a 10, which is it has no effect.

[James]
By all means, then, go ahead and act. The, uh, the fellow here is blinded and stunned.

[Baar-Ur]
Um, I'm going to cast... Hmm.

[James]
Alright, hold on a second. Let me apply... Hey, look at this.

Make sure... Alright, he does not have proficiency in Wisdom or Charisma saves. It's just the Strength, Dexterity, Kong, and Intelligence.

So mark yourself as proficient, and let me make the Wisdom save. Normal. It does succeed, unless somebody has...

Silvery Barbs. Paris, do you have Silvery Barbs?

[Heart]
I don't believe so, no.

[James]
No. Alright, and any spells that have a bonus action cast?

[Baar-Ur]
And I don't have a bonus action, a bonus action, anyway.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, that's me, then.

[James]
You don't have a bonus action?

[Frogitha]
Yeah, it's the Confusion. Okay, so I roll a d10?

[James]
Okay. Uh, you roll a Wisdom save at the start of your turn.

[Frogitha]
Okay, Wisdom save. Come on, Paris. What's the DC?

[James]
Right.

[Nessie]
Get your brother away from me.

[James]
Uh, the DC's, uh, the DC's 23, so go ahead and roll a d... They're all roll a d10, because I have the thing right here. Another Formula.

Eight. I'm gonna pop it out. That's an eight.

They have to scroll so far up. This is, uh, eight. The target doesn't move and takes the attack action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach.

Uh, roll me one d6 on, we'll say or we'll say a 5 or 6 to get to attack the Shipgroth itself. So Mimosa.

[Speaker 6]
Flip hit for Mimosa.

[James]
I do. I was just deciding, like, well, because, not really, because Mimosa doesn't have anybody in, like, the one to two space if we're starting from the left. Where's that table?

Alright, so make a melee attack against Mimosa. You have advantage, I guess, because she's... Well, no, you have to just make a regular attack.

Pop out message. Oh, here we go.

[Nessie]
That is... Alright, Monk, you're next. I think he just doesn't do anything.

Hold on. Can I have my...

[James]
He has to make a save, though.

[Nessie]
He does. Oh, is this a Charmed or Frightened?

[Speaker 6]
No, I don't think he was in his Charmed. Otherwise, a lot of us would have been immune to it anyway. Oh, okay.

I was hoping I could be still there for that.

[Frogitha]
Before, um, the Shipgroth's turn, I would like to see what I can do with getting the Brother out, because he can do something as well.

[James]
Yeah, you could give him a turn or have him go on your turn. Get him for Glimmer. Or have him just roll a save at the beginning of his turn.

Oh, that's rough, Monk.

[Nessie]
Yeah. He just stands there.

[James]
Five is... Doesn't move or take actions, right?

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[James]
The Shipgroth's turn will end with him... Well, no, he's still stunned until the end of Corpus' next turn, I think it is.

[Frogitha]
What do I roll? Uh, the...

[James]
Yeah, it's Wisdom. Make a Wisdom save. 21?

That is the highest he can roll, and no, it's a DC 23.

[Frogitha]
Fuck.

[James]
Uh, he does not move or take actions.

[Frogitha]
Oh, for fuck's sake. Can somebody other than Mimosa kill him? Just give him one good punch.

He'll go down. Your brother? Yeah.

I want Blackrazor to eat him. That's very true. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Hera!

[Speaker 6]
Uh... So many people aren't injured at all.

[Nessie]
But can you have stuff to get me out of my position?

[Speaker 6]
I don't! That's why I was gonna heal everyone. Aww.

[James]
Do you have, uh, Beacon of... Beacon of Hope? Bacon of Hope?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I have that, but that still relies on her shitlock. Can you just use Divine Intervention? I can't Divine Intervention guaranteed, and that would take up pretty much everything I can do, which is why I'm like, I don't know if I want to do it right meow.

I mean, I guess there's no heart. It just means I wouldn't... No, wait, hey, hang on.

It's an action. I can do a bonus action. So I'll do my bonus action first.

I'm gonna Masculine Word... Let's see. I am missing...

Let's do fourth level. Okay, so everyone... How many people is that?

That's six. So... One, two, three, five.

Yeah, anyone who's injured, I think. I don't think there's more than six people. Oh, wait.

Yeah.

[Heart]
I'm missing, like, a little bit of health, but it really isn't much.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, only six people get it, but I think there's only six people who are really injured. And then I'm going to use Divine Intervention for a cool free refresh.

[Nessie]
Refresh? Of who?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, like a long rest.

[Nessie]
Oh!

[Speaker 6]
Like an instant long rest. Not quite. Wait, what was it?

No. Opposite.

[James]
Yeah, it's a roll under. It's okay, you'll have a free... You'll be able to long rest after this fight, and then you'll be level 20 if you win.

If nobody's killed. Alright, is that the end of your turn?

[Heart]
Yeah.

[James]
Dr. Basha.

[Heart]
Okay, so, Cyrus, you want your brother out of the way. Let's see if I can... Eh, whatever.

[James]
Make a save at the beginning of your turn.

[Heart]
Oh, right, yes, that. I still am confused. Gosh dang it.

Right. Normal. Huzzah!

Okay.

[James]
Alright, you take 20 psychic damage. You are no longer confused.

[Heart]
Okay, 104. Can I try yanking Cyrus' brother with telekinesis?

[James]
Yeah, sure.

[Heart]
Cool. So I... What am I rolling against here?

[James]
Uh... Just... Well, make the roll, and then...

Well, I figured that out. I guess... The Shivergroth can't contest it, so you could just do it.

[Heart]
Oh, cool.

[James]
And then anything with your bonus action.

[Heart]
I'll just yank him over here, and now I've got nothing with my bonus action that could be used in this situation, so I'll just pull... Let me get out the ruler. Just pull him next to me.

[James]
In the meantime, Corpus... Corpus, did you succeed earlier?

[Speaker 7]
No, I failed, so I... Okay. What?

Unless you get a nat 20.

[James]
Aren't you a monk? No, do you not have proficiency? You have a different proficiency than you're saved in.

Yeah. Yeah, you got strength and cotton. If you get a nat from 19, you would all succeed.

All right. Will me a d10, because I accidentally closed my thing earlier. And 8 is...

You make an attack action against a random creature within reach. So, on a 1 through 3, it's going to be Lyrian. On a 4 through 6, it's going to be the Shivergroth.

[Speaker 7]
It's going to be 6.

[James]
All right, well, the one that you rolled was a 4, so go ahead and attack the Shivergroth. It's... You get to make one attack.

It's... Let's see here. Why isn't it...

It's bloody. It's at about half.

[Speaker 9]
So are we.

[James]
Let's apply it there, so you guys can see.

[Frogitha]
Oh, cool.

[James]
All right, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Frogitha]
Okay, join them 30 feet towards...

[James]
Mimosa, make a save at the beginning of your turn. This fellow is no longer stunned. That was really close.

I had to be on top of the sneak attack thing, because, like, wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 9]
Unfortunate.

[Nessie]
What about Vengeful Life?

[Speaker 6]
It's Constitution, not Wisdom.

[Nessie]
Damn it! What about Vengeful Life?

[James]
All right, make me a... Well, actually, I'll roll a d10. It should just put it directly in the thing here.

4 is you don't move or take actions.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it only does that if it's a... If it's a roll table that's not inside of a spell.

[James]
Right, all right.

[Nessie]
Is this just going to go on forever, or does it just take half a turn?

[James]
When it dies. When it dies, or there's a different condition, which is probably going to be provoked very soon. It just couldn't do it, because it was stunned, ironically.

Lyrian!

[Speaker 5]
All right, saving throw. Fail. d10.

9, I get to act normally. Okay. Okay, spell.

We're going to haste myself. I'm going to move to the opposite side of it. And take the regular attack action.

It's not an attack action, it's just like a one-weapon attack, right? So I don't get to do my...

[James]
No, you get to do your normal... Right, no, for haste. You entered its space, so I'm going to make...

Go ahead and make your attack action first.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, and that has to be just like a regular melee attack, it can't be the blade cantrips, like Green Flame Blade or Booming Blade?

[James]
It's just a regular attack.

[Speaker 5]
And it's still blinded, so this should be with advantage.

[James]
It is with advantage.

[Speaker 5]
For 15.

[James]
Okay, so two things are going to happen. First, you entered its space. Everybody who is not grappled and within 20 feet, go ahead and...

Mimosa, Monk, Lirion, and Corpus, make me a dexterity save.

[Frogitha]
Say that again? Dex.

[James]
Only for people who are not grappled right now, and on the ground.

[Frogitha]
Would that be...

[James]
Who are not grappled. So just Corpus, Monk, Mimosa, and Lirion. Those of you who failed take 20 damage and are not prone.

If you succeeded, you take half. Yes, Monk, and you guys are... No, that's going to be the next thing that happens.

So it's going to use Maddening Song again, but those of you who are already under the effects of Maddening Song... Let's see here. So those of you who are confused right now are no longer confused.

Those of you who were confused... Those of you who were not confused, I need you to make the save again. 23 succeeds.

It is a DC 23, it's just... No, 23 succeeds. I know it says 24 on this, it's supposed to be 23.

Dr. Basha, weren't you already confused earlier?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I was.

[James]
If you were already confused, you are no longer confused, and you have... It's literally just Para, because I think she's the only one that actually succeeded earlier. Nobody is confused anymore.

[Speaker 5]
I also have no fucking idea why.

[James]
I have no idea why you're blinded. Nothing that was on there was supposed to inflict blinded on you.

[Speaker 6]
Is this like one square to the left?

[James]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's not you, it's the Shivagrog. You're just standing in its effects corner, so it looks like you're hitting it.

[Speaker 5]
That's hilarious.

[James]
Yeah, just apply prone to yourself, I guess, because you were not prone earlier. But that is... So that's that.

Kyrona. You are grappled but no longer confused. That's okay, I imagine you only have one target here.

Oh yeah, no, it's big enough. Wow. I rolled a five.

Geez. Alright. Anything with your bonus action?

He has a bar. He has a health bar. Oh yeah.

Alright, I will do that then.

[Frogitha]
I'm just gonna... Can I Misty Staff you?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's what she just did.

[Frogitha]
So that's a... That's a bonus action. Do I use a spell slot for that?

[James]
If you didn't have a bar, then yeah.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[James]
You use a warlock spell slot for it. But you don't... I would just mark it as not consuming anything and then not worrying about it.

So you get out of it, and then what would you like to do with your action?

[Frogitha]
How far away is that? I can't see.

[James]
20 feet. Yeah, drag yourself over.

[Frogitha]
Alright, 30 feet. Right there. Oh, there you go.

I think it's 30 feet.

[James]
You can do an action spell. Yeah, sure.

[Frogitha]
My dude here gets 10. Uh-huh. By healing.

That's our main concern right now. Treating him like he's made of glass.

[James]
Alright, and... Is he gonna do something now? Or do we got Monk up next?

[Frogitha]
I might have him shoot.

[James]
If he doesn't have a magic weapon, it would be...

[Frogitha]
He's kind of...

[James]
Oh yeah, there you go. A little under-equipped at the moment. Yeah!

Monk!

[Nessie]
Alright, I'll be right back. I stand up. That's just my movement, right?

Half your movement. That's fine. I'm under.

I'm under the critter.

[Speaker 6]
Also, I believe it would still be at advantage?

[Nessie]
So...

[James]
They are at advantage. He's still blinded.

[Nessie]
Okay.

[Speaker 9]
Whoa!

[Speaker 5]
Whoa!

[James]
Goodness, finally got a turn back. I'm just gonna move the people and still grappling over this way.

[Speaker 6]
I sure wish I could see the screen. I've got a cat butt in my face, though.

[Frogitha]
Can I do one last thing?

[James]
Yeah!

[Frogitha]
He's gonna fly up so that he doesn't hit anyone. And aim at this thing. Or make it down.

Oh, ignore that.

[James]
He would have still been... Oh wait, no. He just makes a...

[Frogitha]
Nice.

[James]
Alright. Folks, you get to make your... I'm just gonna make the attack first, and then you guys can make your reaction attacks against him.

[Nessie]
Wait, when did I get here? Oh wait, no, I've been here the whole time.

[Speaker 6]
Do I get a hit? Oh wait, no!

[James]
You're right. I shouldn't have moved you. Yeah, but you're not grappled, so you're fine.

I have to make these at... Well, the grappled people I need to make at... Oh, fucking...

This is gonna be such a huge pain in the ass. So the grappled people I get to attack normally, the other people I get to... I have to do a disadvantage.

Actually, let me just make it against everybody with disadvantage. No, let's just do a separate one. Alright guys, let me roll the attack first, like I said.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, you told us all to do it?

[James]
No, I said let me roll the attack first. Alright. So we're gonna do the disadvantage against you guys.

Watch hit. And there's your damages. Attack.

Wounds. Okay, so that hits you too. And then...

Damage. Okay. Alright, so that's...

You may continue your attacks. Yeah. Alright, so that one dealt over ten, so you can do that.

Kyrona, you still got a bunch of spell damage to roll.

[Baar-Ur]
Yeah, sorry, my dad wasn't having me taste testing them.

[James]
Oh, you're fine.

[Nessie]
Oh boy. What were you taste testing?

[Baar-Ur]
Um, cranberry sauce.

[Nessie]
Oooh.

[Baar-Ur]
We make it with fresh cranberries and port and cranberry butter.

[James]
Corpus, you already rolled your damage, I thought.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I thought you didn't count that one. No, I did.

[James]
I just want people to, uh... Alright. Garrison Sauron and Doctor Bansha if Doctor Bansha wants to make an attack.

You have the option of not doing so if you have a... That's fair.

[Heart]
I'm not doing that. Well, the blue...

[James]
Uh, not unless you have like a reaction from Kyrona or one of Kyrona's abilities that let you move.

[Baar-Ur]
Um... Misty Step.

[James]
Oh. You use it as a reaction. Whatever.

[Baar-Ur]
It's a bonus action.

[James]
Right, but this is as a reaction to, um, I guess taking damage or getting attacked. Alright, is that everybody's damages? Did you roll all your damages for the, um...

Elchurch Blast? I thought I only saw one.

[Frogitha]
Oh.

[James]
You can also use Elchurch Blast if you would like. Oh, you did roll the damage. I just didn't...

Alright, so I need to apply that to you and... That one. Is he...

Wait, no. Okay, he's dead. Uh, Kyrona, how would you like to do this?

Sorry.

[Frogitha]
Um...

[Baar-Ur]
Just three Elchurch Blasts straight into the three most central mouths.

[James]
Delicious. It's right as you see all the heads coming in that you just kind of feed them through the three largest that you can see on this side and feed them directly into the, whatever counts for this thing's intestines or digestive system, and they ricochet like a .22 caliber bullet inside somebody's skull. There's no exit velocity so it just keeps mounting.

And the critter falls apart.

[Frogitha]
You're gonna be tattooed on the character's, like, forearm for this. Holy shit. I...

[Nessie]
Melissa goes over hands up so you can see she's not armed. I'm so sorry.

[James]
That was so fucking close.

[Nessie]
Holy shit.

[Frogitha]
That was real damn close. Darius is, like, glaring at her. You know, like, holding her brother, like, how dare you.

[James]
Alright, all of you add 15,000 XP to your character sheets.

[Speaker 6]
We don't actually?

[Heart]
There's probably more than that. Ooh, I leveled up.

[James]
Yeah, because you got 30,000 from last game. Uh...

[Heart]
30,000? 1, 5...

[James]
Those were present from last, uh, last session.

[Heart]
Yes, yes, I'm not adding that. I'm just impressed about how much they got.

[James]
Well, they fought, like, three or four adult dragons. I think it was four.

[Frogitha]
Oh my god, I leveled up again. Woo!

[Speaker 6]
So did Mimosa. Huzzah! And then do you want us to click the level up button?

[James]
Yes. If you want to take a long rest here, you could. There's...

The only time pressure is the one for, uh...

[Frogitha]
Does Siren take that as well?

[James]
Yeah, he was here.

[Heart]
Pedal sticks, I can actually take a... Oh, wow.

[Speaker 6]
I have maxed out. Level up complete. Officially level 20.

Yay! Yay! It's very fitting that I...

[James]
Um... What do you mean?

[Speaker 6]
I was just gonna say, like, what extra things I get for it, but, um, all I think I got was the divine intervention.

[James]
Forget this. Only thing I have is, you know, total command of the gods.

[Speaker 7]
What was our... I can't believe that's all I get, man.

[James]
15,000. It's very fitting that I finish off my last... My very last 5D campaign with somebody reaching level 20.

[Speaker 7]
Hey, I think... I think that's amazing.

[Heart]
It is. Congratulations on reaching, um, the peak of D&D.

[Speaker 6]
The peak of D&D. The only character I will ever have that will reach level 20.

[James]
Well, there's no reason to assume that. You're fucking, uh... Do you reach level 20 in the next one?

[Speaker 6]
Well, in D&D is what I meant.

[James]
Ah, right.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Pathfinder's D&D.

[James]
Pathfinder 2nd Edition is not... Well, yeah, Pathfinder 2nd Edition is... Well, I mean, come on.

If we're going by brand names. If we're going by games type, then, yeah, Pathfinder 2nd Edition is D&D, but 5th Edition is not. I'm omitting.

[Heart]
Choices, choices. Should I get a feat, or should I improve my dexterity so I don't... I'm not the same dex as a rat.

Actually, you know what? I should take Warcaster. I need to take Resilient.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wait. Wouldn't I have gotten an ability increase, or does that happen last on 8? Probably 8.

[James]
19 is the last one where an ability...

[Speaker 6]
I was going by, wait, 20 is divisible by 4. Why is that not a thing? Yeah.

I forgot that it's technically like, oh, it's 8. You get it when you hit, like, I don't know. Oh.

They do weird things with it.

[James]
Yeah, they do a last thing for like, oh, we couldn't figure out a level 19 thing, so.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Oh, I also get one extra 7th level spell.

[Nessie]
Oh, yay! Congratulations! Monk is now timeless.

You will not die. Except when we go back in time. I know.

He's like, reaching enlightenment as everything's restarting.

[Speaker 6]
And I get to prepare one extra spell. I can't forget that, so I'm prepared through resurrection, so if any of us die...

[Heart]
Splendid.

[Speaker 6]
Um... Actually, wait, I have Divine Invention.

[Nessie]
That technically would also count. ...to you and your brother. I'm sorry.

[Frogitha]
She probably under- Charis probably understands, but I don't know about Spirid. He's like, what the hell, man?

[James]
This is going to be a rough one.

[Nessie]
Yes, not my finest moment. Yes, I love it. I'm just going to say you're the one.

Are you kidding me? It's like Black Razor.

[Frogitha]
No one died, this is okay. Fucking Black Razor, my god. I know, I was like, you know what?

Give me that damn knife.

[Nessie]
I'm throwing it in the damn pool. No, um... We'll see.

[Heart]
I mean, hey, if you don't throw it in the pool, you get to stab, you know, the head of some mafia again. Evil Guild more like, but yes.

[Frogitha]
Wait, if the knife is somewhere else, does that duplicate it in the next world?

[James]
Which knife? What are we talking about?

[Frogitha]
Does the knife have Black Razor in the next world?

[Nessie]
Does the knife- If I drop it in a pool, does the knife get it in the next world?

[James]
Oh, okay. No, he would have- I guess he would have some other knife.

[Frogitha]
Imagine two Black Razors floating around on- That would be so funny.

[Heart]
They would hate each other, but it would be so funny.

[Nessie]
And Mimosa would own both of them and tell them not to squabble like children.

[Speaker 5]
We get a long rest? Is that what we said?

[James]
Yeah, if you guys want to- You guys are free to long rest here. There's a turning of the proverbial wheel in the sky.

[Speaker 5]
And then we have one more pool, right?

[James]
We've got three more pools.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[James]
I mean, the next one depends on how quickly you guys complete that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so we pick an item.

[James]
The Shivergroth that you fought was a nerfed version. I was very surprised that nobody had fire damage, because it's like all mummies, it's weak to fire damage.

[Speaker 5]
I had fire damage, but I got to take one turn. Yeah.

[James]
The idea is it uses Mad Living Song, and then it uses it a second time by virtue of getting smacked. And that clears everybody, but every time it downs somebody, it gets to use it a- They become vulnerable to it again. And also the damages for a normal Shivergroth is 3d12, as opposed to 2d6.

You guys didn't fight the full thing. Why? There would be no memory of it.

There's also a bunch of other features and abilities called it.

[Heart]
He wants us to get eaten, is that it?

[Speaker 6]
He wants to fight it all on his own.

[Heart]
Well, yes. Clearly. Clearly, clearly.

[Speaker 5]
It just has confusion and...

[Heart]
I reckon you will die. Yes. Because, you know, based on your wisdom score, you will die.

[James]
You guys didn't fight it in lair, didn't fight it, um, it didn't have the Resonant Carapace, didn't have Call the Starspace, uh, didn't have Heat Death Manifest.

[Nessie]
Yeah, I think one of the reasons we- oh wait, no, that was a different one.

[James]
Which one were you thinking of?

[Nessie]
I was thinking, I keep getting the, um, the mum- the, like, the Pyramid confused with Mimosa's Temple.

[James]
I don't- Right. No, the- there was the Pyramid that you guys fought at in, well, technically two places, uh, because it teleported itself out of the first one. But, yeah, it was a mummy, and you guys finished off that mummy at the- you guys finished off that mummy at the excavation site, I believe it was.

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[James]
Alright, you guys get your stuff finished up, and I, in the meantime, will grab some chicken pot pie.

[Nessie]
Yes, you may- I won't get to do the next one.

[James]
Oh, yeah, one of you needs to figure out- figure out who- I can still hear you guys, but, yeah, debate about yourselves, who would like to do the next memory here.

[Speaker 7]
I think half of you would do that.

[Heart]
Who hasn't gone yet? I don't think I've had my memories searched through yet. Wasn't it who I was fighting?

No. Oh, that was mine.

[Frogitha]
Okay.

[Heart]
You can go if you want to. We have two- we have two more after this one, anyway.

[Frogitha]
Terrace is already gone. That was Mimosa's. Monk's was earlier.

What was Monk's? Monk's was the hippie? I think so.

I was eager to see a memory of Monk's, because you just refused to tell us his backstory.

[Nessie]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
His backstory is... He's too drunk to remember.

[Baar-Ur]
That's exactly why he's drunk. He was molded out of roadside dirt by...

[Speaker 6]
He's a terracotta warrior, but like garbage.

[Nessie]
It was funny. He was like one of the first few, and they were like, oh, that sucks. Throw it out.

Prototype. I thought about doing it on the rule line. Making him a flesh whore?

No, sharing his backstory. Ah. Save it.

Don't tell us. I'm getting mixed signals here. Don't tell us yet.

[Heart]
Listen to the person who wants it.

[Frogitha]
Give us little snippets of it. The thing is, maybe, yeah.

[Nessie]
This is so sad. It depends on what the reboot looks like. Anyway, so so far, what beastie do you want to fight?

[Baar-Ur]
I was going to think about Hybrona's first mission, which was to help out Taliesin. I remember there were stained glass butterflies. Let's see what happens.

[Nessie]
Hmm. Huh. Like the hide behind?

Is that what you're asking? You want to instantly die?

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, the what?

[Nessie]
The hide behind.

[Speaker 7]
Not the hide behind.

[Nessie]
That thing is cursed. I will jump into the pool myself. It is a Yeah, go for it.

[Speaker 5]
Why don't we spread out a bit so to avoid cone stuff.

[James]
I don't think that the hide behind was important for as much as possible.

[Nessie]
No, no, no. That was a separate conversation.

[James]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Let's find a boss.

[Nessie]
I don't even know. I feel like the hide behind is one of those no matter what you run away.

[Speaker 6]
It doesn't have a stat block. It's not killable.

[James]
Nobody tried to do anything with one exception. One person cast Fireball at it. It's the only time somebody tried to hit it.

Well, yeah, it has evasion. Primarily, yeah.

[Heart]
What did it do? Sorry, I must have missed it, but what did it do exactly?

[Baar-Ur]
It just grabs people and vanishes with them.

[Nessie]
Oh! Or it just like insta-kills them. It reaches out and insta-kills them.

Oh, that is unpleasant. I know. Stay out of the cloud forest.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, like the Appalachians.

[Speaker 7]
If we're all gonna reset to level 1, we're all gonna go back in time. That's my logic.

[Frogitha]
You're not gonna fight this thing. You gotta survive to be able to go back.

[Heart]
Yeah, if you die, you're still gone.

[Frogitha]
You die here, you die in real life. Acknowledged.

[James]
Yeah, when was your first session? It was closer to April 2023, so it was shortly after Slilespire. Oh, interesting.

One of your first sessions was fighting Manassas.

[Baar-Ur]
Mm-hmm. I was considering thinking about the Seal of Seals.

[Speaker 9]
Oh!

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, and I didn't drop anything. Should I do that now?

[James]
Oh yeah, you guys do have to decide to drop something. But it's like, obviously, whoever you decide to... If Corona moves forward, I think that the first thing that would pop up...

Probably the Seal of Seals is the first thing that would pop up. That's the most draconic critter that I can recall you fighting that has not been already fought in this context.

[Frogitha]
How high is the ceiling?

[Speaker 7]
The ceiling?

[James]
You guys are in... I described the realm to you earlier. I will overrun you again, though, once I come back.

[Baar-Ur]
Hey, Rona is going to kneel by the side of the pond and take Oberon's ring from her back. And for the first time since we got it, you guys see the crown of golden leaves on her head disappear. Oh!

And she tells it, I'll find you again, Fred. Aw.

[Speaker 7]
I swear that the hair...

[James]
It'll be fine! We were meant to be. Where are you leaving me, though?

Alright, so you're going to leave it with the seal, or are you going to... Are you forcing a different memory in here?

[Nessie]
No, I'm leaving it with the seal. Oh, the seal? Like the seal seal?

[James]
Yes, the seal seal.

[Nessie]
Yeah! I think that was my first one, too. That seal!

The what? The seal! The seal seal.

[James]
Did it drop on the map for you guys?

[Nessie]
Yeah! Oh, there he is. Seal of...

[James]
Zephain's castle is protected by seven frozen seals. Magical seals. And you can attempt to fight them, you can't attempt to break them by fighting them, in which case the seal transforms into a very large seal.

[Heart]
That's nice. So... Sorry, the seal is in the castle?

[Nessie]
It's guarding the castle.

[Heart]
Oh, so this will be in the Feywild where we're dropping this stuff off. Right here. Oh, right, was the answer of how high the ceiling is answered?

[James]
There's no ceiling!

[Heart]
No ceiling? Ah, okay, thank you. We are outside.

Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. Okay.

What does it call for me in the Feywild?

[Frogitha]
I need a magic item. I think I'm gonna look for the uh, discovered items.

[Nessie]
Uh, you can toss Merrill's dragon item for him. I gave Monk the hidden magic nail.

[Heart]
Uh, I can give you my power pot of enclosure, res.

[Speaker 5]
I've got some extra stuff. I have a ring of protection, a plus two arcane grimoire.

[Frogitha]
I'm gonna go into the discovered items just because there's interesting things in there. I'm gonna grab the pariah's shield and toss it in there.

[Nessie]
The pariah's shield has no water!

[Frogitha]
Well, now he can find it in wherever this is.

[Heart]
Why are you sobbing?

[Nessie]
What? Because he had to give it up to a unicorn. He had to give all of his magical possessions up to a unicorn to get a sword and become and like, it became a thing.

Now you know where it is so Nox can get it again. I know, just like I'm imagining Mimosa drops Blackrazor into the ice cold water.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Heart]
It's a real- When was the first time you guys went into the Feywild? The seal seal.

[Nessie]
Yes, the seal seal. No, okay. Let me rephrase.

How soon was that? That was my first one, I think.

[James]
The very first time anybody ventured into the Feywild was with Dwarf Friend and the besieged White Orchid Cairn.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that was Parah's- not Parah's first, but I think that was one of the first I did.

[James]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Because I remember the first one was we looked out over a hex that had fallen in, and that's all I remember. And there were like druids there, I think.

[James]
Yeah, which has never been placed on the map, but you were teleported there.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it was that way? I never knew where that was.

[James]
Yeah. You guys were actually teleported there two different times. Which was fun.

Ooh, the hangman's nail.

[Nessie]
You said you needed something, right?

[Speaker 7]
Also, Monk, you did have- or not Monk, Yeah, okay, I'll put that for you down then. Corpus, you did have a Plustery Sword and Plustery Shield from...

[James]
I have no idea why.

[Speaker 7]
Just place those two in.

[Heart]
Oh, do you not need something?

[Speaker 7]
Go ahead and place one in. Oh, I'll place the shield in.

[Nessie]
Okay, so Monk will need two for the next two.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, are there two more?

[Nessie]
There's two more after this.

[Heart]
I can give you something for that. We gotta go fast, though. Yes.

[James]
Add yourself some addition in the meantime.

[Heart]
Bless you. Thank you. Oh, no!

Wait, hold on. There, a fly entered my room. One second.

[Speaker 6]
I can look over and see a cloud of flies that have entered my room. Never mind, it's a bee!

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that's worse. Oh, yeah. So, let's go do something about that.

[Speaker 5]
What do we know about this in terms of its strengths and weaknesses? It's made of ice. Okay.

It's cute.

[Nessie]
It is cute.

[Frogitha]
We're gonna melt it.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Nessie]
It can travel a long way. I do remember that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so maybe webbing it would be good? I don't think web is big enough for it.

[Speaker 6]
It could also just, like, instant kill it, you know? Yeah. Don't know if we want to save that for anything.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, we have an hour and a half left, so I think we just speedrun it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
If we speedrun it, we get more of an epilogue, I think.

[Heart]
I have managed to get the bee out. Thank you. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
For 24 hours, I would like to be able to kill anything I touch instantly.

[Heart]
What?

[Speaker 5]
I can do Otto's irresistible dance, so it'll have to skip a turn. Unless it has a way to avoid it.

[Heart]
Alright. I was asking about the ceiling, by the way, because I can pick- I picked up reverse gravity.

[Speaker 5]
Is there a ceiling?

[Heart]
There is not.

[Speaker 5]
On the surface, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So, reverse gravity would kill us.

[Heart]
Yes, but if I could adjust on the seal, if I could adjust on the seal, you know.

[Speaker 7]
I mean, it might kill you guys. Don't kill Corpus, because he's likely going to fall down.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but are you immune to needing to breathe?

[Speaker 7]
Um...

[Heart]
Well... Alright, above us is no air? We're in space.

Well, far enough.

[Speaker 5]
Well, yes, right. We're surmined on a moon, okay?

[Heart]
I wasn't sure how well we could breathe.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think there's an infinite column of air above you.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Thank you. I can, you know, hold it for a good, solid, uh...

[Speaker 5]
Good, solid infinity?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Frogitha]
You'd be floating around out there until you discover a new planet.

[Speaker 7]
I know, it's like, uh... gas. You know, you die from the gases.

[Nessie]
And then Mimosa plucks you out of this, uh... space.

[Heart]
It's also come to my attention that it's a 50-foot radius, not a 50-foot diameter, so yes, that would just kill everyone.

[Nessie]
Let's not do that.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, please just run away.

[Nessie]
See, we don't get our ending, our restart.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, really?

[Heart]
Let's see, what other thing can I pick up instead of reverse gravity?

[Speaker 6]
Hey, God, can you kill the next, like, three things that try to kill us?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool, God. Like, I don't really believe in humans, but I think that'd be cool.

[Heart]
I mean, in D&D they straight up do exist. They're tangible things. So, yeah, exactly.

It is a drag.

[Frogitha]
Unless you're that one obnoxious player that we had who tried to pick a fight with the one that burst into flames.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yeah.

[Frogitha]
His character was an atheist. Wait, which guy was that? Wait, did that actually happen?

He was trying to pick a fight with the paladins because he didn't believe in their God.

[James]
That was a weird pedophile guy who put a bunch of uh... I just habitually call people pedophiles if I don't like them. Don't read too far into it.

No, but he was a fucking weirdo. If you look at his internet history, he has the same username. So the only stuff I find on him online is like a bunch of anti-gay complaints.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my God. Was it the same guy that you took video of?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Frogitha]
Yes, that motherfucker.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my God.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. God, he was a lot.

[Speaker 7]
You don't watch this shit. It makes me cry. It's so wild.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, don't I have something that's been pinned in there?

[James]
Do you? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I said Jimbofication.

[Speaker 7]
Everybody does. It just comes true, man.

[Frogitha]
Part of being human, judging people before you know them.

[Speaker 6]
That's okay. Almost everybody that I've gotten a bad vibe from has been banned or kicked by now, so...

[James]
Yeah, that's why I started having guys tell me beforehand. Like, oh, is this...

[Speaker 6]
I am pretty sure I told you that those two guys I had a vibe on and it took a while for them to get banned. Which two? The guy that kept whining about relationships and then also him.

[Speaker 9]
I don't remember him because I had him blocked.

[Frogitha]
VileTyrant did really play with us anyway.

[James]
He did. He was a gay and he just couldn't abstract that... I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[James]
You will be conscripted for several sessions for the Hidden Bluff dungeon. I think everybody will at some point.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah. Yes.

[Nessie]
Oh, I thought you guys should have been able to do that. I technically haven't TPK'd you guys. She almost TPK'd us.

[James]
Alright, we're gonna finish this fight and I'm gonna give you guys a description when we move to the next scene. Mimosa is up first!

[Speaker 6]
Okie dokie.

[James]
We love a little bit of Hunt Showdown.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'll keep that as well. We really run low on time. Indeed.

[James]
This one's not nearly as bad. Oh yeah. Oh, there it is.

Not within 5 feet. Alright, anything for your bonus action?

[Nessie]
What dagger do I still have left? You have your other one. No, I tossed the mean one.

Oh? Oh, you did? I did!

The mean one is now at the bottom of a frozen lake. Okay.

[Frogitha]
Probably the best place for it to be. That's what I was thinking.

[James]
Alright, that brings us to Lirion. Lirion, uh... does he have stuff in his, uh...

Who knows?

[Speaker 6]
Just like this!

[James]
Oh, he fails!

[Speaker 5]
Alright, uh... Anything for your bonus action? Negative, that's it.

[Speaker 7]
Here we go, alright.

[James]
Corpus!

[Speaker 9]
Shut up.

[Speaker 7]
Let's do a fisting match.

[Heart]
Mustn't phrase it that way. It's necessary.

[Speaker 7]
And I will stop pretending that it is not.

[James]
Okay. Why is it, uh... Does it just have flat bludgeoning resistance?

Oh no, it's because your thing isn't marked as... For some reason, your fists are not marked as magical. Which they should be.

It is immune to stunned. Alright, anything else to return? Raise the legendary action to slam.

And then monk. Go while I am slamming. Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
That is rough.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah.

[James]
So your unarmed strikes are marked as... as magical. Alright, cool.

Cool, cool, cool. Anything else to return?

[Nessie]
Nope.

[Heart]
I realized I was muted. Right, I'm going to try the new spell I picked up. Uh, I was going to say it's not supposed to hit you, I want it to fly up and point downwards at the frozen seal so, um...

you guys don't get caught in the blast.

[Speaker 7]
I wasn't talking about that. I was talking about the slam.

[Heart]
Ah, okay. Well, I'm going to roll the damage.

[James]
I rolled very high.

[Speaker 7]
That's depressing.

[James]
You do have a reaction.

[Heart]
You know what? Yeah, you know what? I do have a reaction so I'm going to still roll the damage and also make you um...

I'm going to silvery barbs that.

[Nessie]
There we go.

[James]
Now do I have to make a... When do I do the... Or become frightened.

Okay. So it's just not frightened is the deal. And then it has to do...

[Heart]
This is going to be acid damage. Actually, no, like, yeah, acid damage.

[James]
Alright, now it has to make an intelligence save attribute. It's not going to be terribly good at that. Um, I'm not going to bother.

It has a 2 intelligence. Ah. It cannot succeed.

Did you say acid damage?

[Heart]
Yes.

[James]
They're immune to acid damage.

[Heart]
Are you kidding me?

[James]
It's a water elemental.

[Heart]
Well, alright. I'm tired.

[James]
You don't have to, I mean, you would know that. It wouldn't choose something else. It's not acid.

Okay, I'm assuming also not cold. So.

[Heart]
Yes, of course not. Okay, yes, not cold either. My grandpa.

I thought it was just a really big seal. Alright, so. Is it immune to lightning?

[James]
No.

[Heart]
Do you not, like, have access to fire?

[James]
It doesn't take any special damage from fire. It doesn't, um. It just took normal damage from fire earlier.

[Heart]
Okay, fire. That's the simplest one.

[James]
Yeah, no, I already applied the damage. Anything for your bonus action?

[Heart]
Uh, uh, no. I'm just going to move a little bit further away.

[James]
Alrighty. Alright, I just need everybody on the map to make me a save. Uh, usability, cool.

All of you, everybody.

[Heart]
Can I even make the save? No, I can't. I just failed.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, neither of us were going to get that, so.

[James]
Corpus! Oh, you already made it, okay. Already failed it.

Alright, uh, 35 damage to those of you who fail, which appears to be everybody. Uh, no, it's not an attack. Dr. Basha, did you make your save?

[Heart]
No, not 20. I would lose. I didn't even bother.

[James]
Oh, okay, that's fair. That's 35 damage. Well, that's its turn.

Taris!

[Frogitha]
Alright, so if I want to conjure an elemental, a fire elemental, do I just go into plutonium and drag him down?

[James]
Uh, sure. Technically that has a 10 minute casting, or is it like a 1 hour? It's a large casting time.

[Speaker 6]
Really?

[James]
Um... Oh, wait, no, that's, okay, that's conjure. Uh, alright.

There's different spells. Yeah, no, you're good.

[Frogitha]
This might take a second, so if you want to just go ahead and skip while I'm doing this?

[James]
Uh, force a creature to...

[Speaker 6]
Ow, ow, ow, buddy boy. Ow.

[Baar-Ur]
Oh, your nails are sharp.

[Speaker 6]
Ow, don't bite me. Ponium...

[James]
creatures... So you can just set him to enter the spirit space. Okay, so...

[Frogitha]
So just a fire elemental? That's basically what it is?

[James]
Yeah, so it's, um, well, it just takes damage if it starts its turn within 5 feet of the of the thing. Yeah, no, that's totally fine. I just have it make the deck save now.

It'll take, uh... Which would succeed.

[Frogitha]
Does it take half or anything?

[James]
It's not restrained, so it just takes 4d8. Why did they do it like that? Everything else is half, but for this one it's like, uh, roll 4d8.

Got it. Just roll your roll. Alright, Kyrona.

Nope, she might be gone for the moment. Uh... You might have muted yourself.

You also did not apply your damage from earlier. I'll apply it for you. No, it's a 250 foot...

Yeah, it's the map. I already applied... I just, yeah, I just applied it to you.

Is that the convenient effects? Ooh, convenient effects, my beloved. I sure can.

He's got a pretty good chance of making this. Ah! I embarked him as squeaked to indicate advantage.

Uh, that would miss. Kyrona. Uh, yeah, he fails.

I can say that with confidence. Yeah. He's incapacitated.

He can no longer take actions or reactions. Ah. Bringing us to Para.

[Speaker 6]
Sunbeam?

[James]
He's in there.

[Speaker 6]
He is in there. Yeah.

[James]
Apply... Half. Very good.

Alright, and anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 6]
Um, bonus action...

[James]
Um... So, you know, Mimosa, you're up next. Uh, go ahead and start rolling attacks because there's a good chance you guys kill him before he gets a chance to do his next turn.

Okay. Especially because he's incapacitated.

[Speaker 6]
That'll be it for me.

[James]
Alright. That one ends. Sneak attack.

[Nessie]
Oh! Oh, there's someone... Okay.

[James]
There are many someones with a marine.

[Nessie]
Okay.

[Heart]
You also have advantage from the whole Glitter Wyvern thing.

[Nessie]
Yes, I take the advantage, yeah.

[James]
That's what the advantage is from, yeah. Alright, I applied it. It's not looking so hot.

Next people to do damage. Lyrian, Corpus, Monk, Pasha. Roll damages.

[Heart]
Alright. He has to make another Intelligence saving throw, by the way.

[James]
He fails. There's no way he makes that. You can just roll it down.

[Heart]
Cool, and then... Let's see, what do I use my action on? Just hitting it again.

Splendid.

[James]
Someone did not fix their fists.

[Speaker 7]
I don't know how to fix them.

[James]
Go into your fists and mark them as magical.

[Heart]
Oh my... Ah, it's not affected by this stupid lightning.

[James]
He is affected by lightning. Oh, so he's dead.

[Heart]
Alright, dead. Dead!

[James]
The most adorable elemental in all the planes and worlds has been reduced to a very, very weepy shattered icy image before fading into the ether.

[Heart]
Splendid.

[Speaker 5]
Do we have one more pool, or are we all done with pools?

[James]
You are finished on this place.

[Heart]
Just got to remove that template now. There we go.

[Speaker 5]
Can we maybe reposition some of these text boxes there?

[Nessie]
Yeah, the text boxes are just there for me.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was thinking we'd need to put more... You know, like we'd need to cram in more in these other pools, but we'll go into a new map.

[James]
There, now I can see that stuff properly. Best doctrines... Oh, I don't know what happened there.

Okay, so now I'm going to activate here. Whoops, I didn't mean to click that.

[Nessie]
That's their job.

[James]
I'm going to make sure... Oh yeah, tilt commission. It is a global illumination, so...

Go ahead and drop yourselves at the lower portion of the map where the template has been deployed. The one that you guys should be on right now.

[Nessie]
Do you mean the mouth of the spring?

[James]
No. Ah, I see what happened. Activate.

[Nessie]
Okay.

[James]
Towards the bottom of the map, you've got a circle template there. Just go ahead and drop yourselves there.

[Heart]
You know, with your brother being around, I'm wondering if I can shove my intern into a pool so I can pick them up later.

[Frogitha]
My lieutenant died. I wouldn't have like three people here.

[James]
Alright, so to describe the Brilliance again, this is a place of... This is just a place of extreme color and extreme heat. It's aligned with law.

It's planar alignment is towards law and towards the element of fire and it's an adjacent plane, meaning it reflects the... each... most worlds...

I shouldn't say most worlds. A world which has a plane of Brilliance will reflect on that Brilliance, or will be reflected in that Brilliance. That sounds like something you could travel from every single place.

It mostly looks like the interior... kind of looks like the prettiest cloud layers of a gas giant that you could imagine. There's colors swirling in.

Most of them are actual manifestations of fire. Everything is color-coded here based on its uppermost and lowermost ranges of height. So the worms that you occasionally see traveling off in the distance have like a very low blue color, a very cool blue color to indicate that they travel beneath the ground whereas the top halves of them have a very...

a nearly white reddish color to indicate how that they can reach the farthest clouds. The plants here have a similar color code and pretty much everything does. It's just like a gradation in the middle where it transitions from its lowermost color code to its highermost.

The land here is primarily floating. It's a bunch of floating landmasses. There are none near the well of...

the one hosting the well of stars. Virtually all of them seem to be pretty far away. This place is secluded, as Sol Brasier can tell you.

Now these last two pools are optional.

[Frogitha]
Oh? Where do they lead?

[James]
That depends on who walks up to them.

[Frogitha]
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

[James]
Wait, did you do the seal last time?

[Baar-Ur]
Yes, I did.

[James]
Okay. So this one would be... So this one I don't think would bring up anything for you unless you attempted to replace it with a different memory.

If you wanted to force a memory of some other place on it. Then you could do a short rest. What do you think about the first what that you captured?

[Baar-Ur]
The first haunt.

[James]
Haunt? The first haunt? The problem is, what the fuck was there to fight in there?

I don't think you guys really fought much. Well, that's not true. Sure.

When you say the first haunt, we're referring to... Do you recall, like, can you recall which one it was? It was the one with the queen and the princess.

[Speaker 6]
The giant baby thing?

[James]
Well, that was the second or third, technically.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, because there was one that we weren't there for.

[James]
We'll say it was the one that was out on the road, where the... Okay. In which case, I have a second monster to up-down.

[Heart]
That's not a question. Have people put down their tokens?

[Nessie]
Yes, the bottom left of the map.

[Heart]
Ah, okay, now I can see them.

[Nessie]
Okay, thank you.

[James]
Yeah, you were in the padding.

[Nessie]
It seems... yeah.

[James]
All right. Initiative, everybody!

[Nessie]
We're not dropping something down first?

[James]
Well, yes, but go ahead and... You can drop things down, but also we need to have initiatives so we can do this quickly. So Kyron is dropping down the unicorn stuff.

[Heart]
Did I put something in the pool?

[James]
Oh, yeah.

[Heart]
Do you want something? Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Let's see. Where is this going to?

[Speaker 6]
A haunt?

[James]
This is going to a haunt, a place where a... where the queen of the Banyan Cairn faked her death, disguised her twin sister, her good twin sister as herself, got her twin sister killed, and also got her daughter killed in the process.

[Frogitha]
I think that was like my second or first. I think that might have been my first. I don't remember my first.

[Nessie]
Oh, yeah, Kibi was there.

[James]
Kibi was there. Definitely there for the baby.

[Heart]
All right, so you can put... Okay, so I guess for safety's sake I shan't toss in my dimensional shackles. Do you want the Circlet of Blasting or Mardenplate to throw in?

[Frogitha]
Blasting. All right. Blasting.

Thank you.

[Heart]
No problem. If anyone else needs stuff to toss in, do tell.

[Frogitha]
Does anybody, before we start this fight, does anybody have a long-range weapon I can give to Cerys's brother? I have a short bow. Go for it.

I have one of those.

[James]
If you guys go hard on this fight, then you will likely end this in like ten minutes or less.

[Nessie]
Yay! Does Doctor Basia have something Bunk can get rid of for them? Oh, yeah, sure.

One second.

[James]
And Cerys, you plan out your turn while that's going on. Since you're at the top of the Ignition Dome.

[Heart]
Here's a Mardenplate. I will type it in chat.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think that's magical.

[Heart]
It's not? It has effects on it.

[Speaker 5]
Do you want to bring a protection?

[Heart]
Pole of Angling.

[Nessie]
Okay. Okay. What are they?

I'll take the ring.

[James]
One's a Banshee, and the other is a large slime that produces copies of people that it's absorbed.

[Frogitha]
That's scary.

[Heart]
The flail is magical, though. I do have one of those. There's also that.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Heart]
So if you need that instead, you can toss that. I'll take it next turn. Yeah, okay.

[James]
What have we got for us?

[Frogitha]
I'm going to charm one of them. I'm going to charm the Banshee. Actually, no, that can't be charmed, can it?

[Speaker 5]
Undead are typically immune to mind-affecting stuff.

[James]
Typically, but this is an incorporeal one. I don't see an immunity to Charm Deer.

[Frogitha]
All right. I'm going to try to charm it. And so just attack everything but the Banshee.

If that passes.

[Speaker 6]
I was going to turn and die.

[James]
A charm monster just charms... It's not going to attack you.

[Frogitha]
Oh, okay. Never mind, then. Actually, if that's the case, ignore that.

What's the other thing?

[James]
Oh, it's a giant jelly monster called an Obelix.

[Frogitha]
I don't have anything, man. You want to let...

[James]
If you have something to give Mimosa advantage, then Mimosa gets to pop a... Then Mimosa gets Sneak Attack on it.

[Frogitha]
I will Summon Fae and I'll just do a... Not Fae. I don't know how that works.

What is the... Conjure Elemental?

[James]
I'll do a...

[Frogitha]
I'll do a Thunder. A Curse, right? I can do a second spell?

[James]
Yeah, if you have a bonus action. If it's a bonus action spell, then you can do it. That will count for Mimosa's Sneak Attack.

It's her target you go after.

[Frogitha]
You know what? Take a Bardic Inspiration. I'll do that instead for Mimosa.

Not that I think she'll need it, but...

[James]
Apply the damage to both of those. Mimosa!

[Nessie]
Is that also on damage?

[James]
You can use it for anything. Nope. There's an Elemental Spirit within 5 feet.

[Nessie]
Oh, okay. Hits.

[James]
And does that Sneak Attack get applied to somebody else?

[Nessie]
Um... Is there another...

[James]
Oh, yeah.

[Nessie]
Okay, then yes. It'll go through that one.

[James]
Alright. Is that everything? Do you want to use your...

You have Bardic Inspiration, though.

[Nessie]
Oh, shoot! I do. I totally forgot.

You should forget!

[James]
Alright. Elder Obelix is dead, because I had 2 hit points left. That is not like a high-level challenge.

Alrighty. So that brings me to the... Oh, wow.

That was not the one I thought it was. Alright. That's her turn.

Go ahead and start rolling to kill this thing, because there's no way it makes another turn. She's at half already.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I was going to turn on dead.

[James]
What do you destroy at this point?

[Speaker 6]
Level 4?

[James]
Ah, she's CR 6. Alright. If you turn her and people damage her, then she doesn't...

She gets unturned, I think.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, okay. Then I would...

[James]
That hits, by the way. And then it's Monk and Corpus. She's got 21 hit points left.

She's, uh... I'm going to end the combat.

[Heart]
It's guaranteed to be dead by then.

[James]
Yeah. She doesn't have another shot, because I used the wrong fucking thing. It's an older one.

Dragon Cloak is in there. Did you say the Unicorn Staff is in there? Yep.

Oh, wow. That's going to be interesting. Cool.

Cool. Alright. Sol Brashear is going to join you folks.

Where's my boy? This is... Oh.

I got messages. What is this? The Don Quixote...

Oh!

[Nessie]
Oh!

[James]
Oh, that's so good.

[Nessie]
I thought it was fitting for the haunting.

[James]
Sol Brashear will approach at this point and let you know that the ritual to create this ballad is nearing its end. If you have a moment to provide... If you have a moment to provide the Assassin, which he's currently...

He's not holding the Assassin. He's holding like a floating cot that Mark Kool has brought along with him. And he asks, what's this about?

What's this about a ballad? He has been doing great, by the way. A bunch of little elemental draconic spirit things that are native to this place have been coming out in wake of your, I don't know, destruction.

So that's been fantastic.

[Heart]
Much appreciated. Well, about the ballad, time's going to be reset as far as we're aware. We're going to be put in a time loop one of the two.

[James]
Is there a way to get around that?

[Heart]
No. I don't think so. We're much too far from the person who's going to do it, and apparently it's to save us from getting overrun.

[Nessie]
Yeah, you wouldn't want to stop it.

[James]
I don't want to stop it, I just want to know if there's a way to sidestep it.

[Nessie]
You want to remember?

[James]
Not necessarily remember, I just want to take the ship back on my own time. I'm going to give it a shot. I'm going to take my sweet time, though.

I don't want to get wrapped back into the... He keeps looking back to Sol Grigier for hints. If this is a ballad, if this is a time loop, it's probably not going to encompass all of creation.

It's probably going to be a place, so I'm just going to take my sweet time getting back, or driving the boat back, and we'll see if I get caught up in it.

[Heart]
It's the dragon himself who wants to dodge this, right?

[James]
No, Sol Grigier is like... He's totally fine with this. It's Mark Kool, the warlock, who sponsored the expedition.

[Nessie]
Oh, the one who's got the planet.

[James]
No, no. Mark Kool is just a guy... He's just here for basically a safari.

He wants to summon critters from the Brilliance of Braccus, but everybody thinks that there's nothing in the Brilliance of Braccus, so he's trying to one, prove them wrong, and two, see what he can learn about it.

[Nessie]
Well, I would do whatever you would like to do in your whole life in the next, like, 20 minutes?

[Heart]
You make it sound like everyone's going to die.

[Nessie]
If that's relaxing and taking your time and staring at the stars and contemplating, go for it.

[James]
I'm gonna hop on the boat. Sounds like you guys have your own right back at this point. If it works, if my plan works, then I'll see you guys in, like, a long while, I guess.

If not, I mean, you know where I live in Esheros, right?

[Heart]
Sure. Yes, we do. I'm trying to remember not to summon demons.

Well, hang on.

[Speaker 6]
If you don't remember it, I don't know if you will, um, is there something I could, like, tell you that would make you know that, like, we heard something from you and only you?

[James]
Ooh. Uh. I have a...

Give me a moment. Mm-hmm.

[Nessie]
What can I tell you that's not embarrassing?

[James]
Yeah. Aha! I have a scroll from a mage named Lady Evelyn who used to, uh, I believe that she's down in Bromloch, primarily, and we were, we had some correspondence over, you know, purely intellectual pursuits, and she was the one who inspired me to begin seeking out the brilliance to begin with.

So if you, anything from me, Lady Evelyn. And, uh, to my knowledge, nobody else knows that we were that we were chatting.

[Nessie]
We'll find you again.

[James]
Yeah. I mean, at the very least, like, I don't think I have any clues. All right.

I'll see you guys. See you guys later. Best of luck with whatever's about to happen.

[Nessie]
Gestures in general direction.

[Frogitha]
Whatever gets us out of here.

[Nessie]
Monk will hold his hand out. All right. You're getting dirty, filthy, muddy.

I mean, I'll probably forget you after this is over.

[Speaker 5]
Don't you forget about me.

[Speaker 7]
Well, see you next time. Are we, are we avoiding this one?

[Nessie]
We're going to just pass it.

[James]
Okay. Unless you want to use, actually, unless, Perry, you still got a divine intervention left if you want to use it for this.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[James]
What memory would you guys like to, uh...

[Speaker 6]
I'm completely tapped on, like, items, so I'm not really worried about it. What is the first thing that we could have possibly ever done?

[Speaker 7]
Goblins?

[Speaker 6]
We weren't here for level one adventures.

[James]
Uh, the first thing... Well, you guys will be going back to your first available places are going to be Bronlock and the tutorial dungeon will be the Hidden Bluff. So places around there.

There's the Isle of Dread right next to it. I have not brought the Mercury Dracolich in yet, which some of you did fight. But nobody killed.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, like, what...

[Nessie]
I don't think any of us would be able to bring in, like, a level one thing. Um... I have my plus one dagger.

[James]
It's not a level one thing, it's just a place where you have done something. It's not a question of levels.

[Speaker 6]
We've been fighting things, so it's like, it's not like I can just say, yeah, let's just open a portal to Bronlock and throw our stuff in and be able to pick it up level one.

[James]
Well, you guys fought inside, um... inside the dungeon. Like, those weren't, like, level 8 or, like, level 15 encounters.

Um...

[Frogitha]
Okay. Yeah. Uh, where's this portal going to spit us out?

[James]
You guys can decide on it later, so...

[Nessie]
Yeah, let's just go through the portal.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Nessie]
While you folks are going back through this portal. And he'll just sigh and be like, for old times' sake.

[Heart]
And he's probably smiling this time around. It's not just the normal one. But yeah, he's glad they're done.

[James]
You're delightful.

[Heart]
Does Mimosa have a pack on her? Mimosa, do you have, like, a bag on you or something? She has a bag of holding, yeah.

Okay, cool. If you have a free pocket, he's going to Mage Hand a rock into it and will say, you don't owe me anything for that.

[Nessie]
It's a gift. Alright.

[Frogitha]
So when we open this portal, where is it going to spit us out at?

[James]
You folks aren't going inside the portal. Because it's not a portal. This is the Well of Stars.

[Nessie]
Oh, okay. This is where the general lives.

[James]
The assassin. Traditionally, a dragon naming ritual involves depositing some gifts to the creature. It's usually a dragon, of course.

This is a draconic naming ritual. Something to inspire their character as they'll grow up. As they're hatchling.

Something to wield later on. So if you're restoring this person, think of what kind of person you would like them to be. If that has any influence on your decision.

And I hope that somebody's thought of a name.

[Nessie]
I didn't remember that last time. I don't think we were told we have to name her. No, we weren't.

[Speaker 7]
It was a few weeks ago.

[Nessie]
Did she have a name when she was at school?

[Speaker 6]
She was just the girl to us.

[Nessie]
When she was going to school, she should have had a name.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, but we just knew her as the girl.

[James]
She had a name at the school. That's a question. Draconic naming rituals don't really involve a surname associated with a clan.

So stray would work just fine.

[Nessie]
And as for... There we go. All her school stuff.

Mimosa has kept all her school stuff the whole time. Does that work?

[James]
What is that stuff? That's interesting.

[Nessie]
I... It's... Mimosa tried to get it.

Yeah, she asked Mimosa to get her things from the school. Mimosa did, like all her studies, her books, her whatever. And she's kept it this whole time.

No. I will bonk you so hard on the head. I will go...

God kill that man. Ha ha ha. Do we all have to put something in?

[James]
No, it's whatever you guys... however you would like to influence NPC.

[Heart]
I won't need it anymore. I can dump my healer's kit in.

[Frogitha]
We'll make her sweet. I have... I have a glitter gland from a...

[Speaker 6]
There are some body parts. I thought about diamonds, but I don't know if that would be exactly the vibe we're going for. I also don't know if I trust the Alluring Herb.

That would be some odd implications. Hmm.

[Frogitha]
Hold on, do you think she'd like the glitter gland or the glowing sunflower seed?

[Nessie]
Glowing sunflower seed. Okay, I'll do that instead. Yeah.

[Baar-Ur]
If I give her something, will I get it back?

[Nessie]
No. I think this just goes into her.

[Frogitha]
This is hers.

[Heart]
That's why I dumped one of my healer's kits there. It might be pleasant.

[Frogitha]
Ooh! I'm gonna... You know what, just because I think I'm gonna drop another thing in, I'm gonna give her my last remaining musical instrument.

After this, I have to use whistling. Are we fighting anything after this?

[Nessie]
No. Okay. I don't think toxin would go in well.

Have all these beautiful things.

[James]
Uh... You see a snowflake-shaped thread of silk encompass Corpus and begin spiriting him back through a gentle hole in reality. A gentle parting of the threads here.

And he gets dumped on a beach in front of the Hidden Bluff.

[Nessie]
I'm also working... Yeah. Just loading her up with things.

[James]
These are interesting gifts. I wonder how she'll use them in this new life of hers.

[Nessie]
I hope she becomes a bard. Hmm.

[James]
When you're ready, just pronounce her name at the beginning.

[Nessie]
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?

[James]
If everybody has concluded, what you'll do is you'll put her into the pool, and then you'll pronounce her name and wish her farewell on all travels.

[Nessie]
Are we all done, everybody? You know what, I'll just... Yeah.

[Heart]
I was thinking... You know what, last things, because the stars aren't going to be used anytime, I'll just toss in the stars.

[Nessie]
Exactly! It'll fit. I love that.

Okay. Okay, for once, and here we go. Okay.

What am I... Sorry, what am I supposed to say?

[Speaker 6]
You'll just pronounce... Her name and farewell on all her travels. Okay.

[Nessie]
Well, Australia, farewell on all your travels. Don't forget about us. Wish her out.

[James]
She sinks down into the well of stars, and soon it becomes impossible to tell which... where the stars are and where her body is at the beginning, kind of mixing together here. You folks see an image of a very, very large dragon.

Not the shape of a star, but the composition of one peering down at you from the ceiling of this specific structure, which is opened up into another whirling maelstrom of stars. Not like I say maelstrom, it's more like a whirlpool that's kind of like traveling upwards, traveling up the world tree. And each of you begin getting plucked up and sucked into this spiritual whirlwind.

Then you find yourselves on a beach, your memories intact for the most part. And you're sitting in front of the hidden bluff, just as a few fishermen are arriving from Brahma to see what the commotion was about. The sun is warm on your face, and there's not the slightest hint of a chill or winter.

And no frost coming down from the north.

[Nessie]
Well, I think we did it. I think we did too.

[James]
Her skills are a little blunted, diminished. You feel different, like you've been placed into, almost as if you've been placed into new bodies. Like you're learning how to walk again, learning how to talk, but obviously at an accelerated pace.

It'll take a little while to recover.

[Nessie]
Oh my god, Paris and Cirrus are tiny now. I don't remember what I did with Mimosa, but I don't think she's I don't think she's changed. I saw Mimosa like way behind in front of you.

[Heart]
Monk is a little muddier.

[Nessie]
Monk looks about the same, except a little bit muddier, and his stench, his BO is gone, so you're welcome for that. But she still does smell like booze. We all got used to it.

[James]
Kyrona has fallen in with a familiar textbook from a familiar university. And that is it.

[Speaker 5]
That is the last 5e game.

[Heart]
Yay!

[Speaker 5]
It's over! The nightmare is over.

[Heart]
Thank you for running it. I am released. Yes, thank you.

[James]
Thank you guys for playing. I especially enjoyed you folks. That was a delight.

All of you have been a wonderful change of pace from the occasional weirdos that I am that are inflicted upon me from random servers, and I do think that that's going to be less common with Pathfinder second edition, but like I said, if you guys are uncomfortable with people in the next game, or if people are being rude to you in a game that you're running, you are welcome to just kind of have them gone.

[Speaker 6]
I'll just murder them. It's fine. It's apparently very easy for me to do, so I will just murder them.

[Frogitha]
So when can we expect to be playing?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yes. I also have to give you things.

[James]
No, I did see the modules that you... I didn't get a chance to respond, but I did see the modules that you sent me, which I'll be definitely using.

[Speaker 6]
I also have not sent you my settings, which are like the absolute minimum I think you should have. I got it down to 30.

[James]
That's fine. Listen, it's not like I have to hand install everything. Foundry server takes care of most of it for me.

So I'm not playing my Lancer game this Thursday, because it will be Thanksgiving. I'm looking at a tentative start date for around maybe like... I could do two things.

Either I could start at the very beginning of January, or I could do a tentative like maybe one of the... No, not on Monday. It would be like a...

No, it would probably be like a Thursday or a Friday on... Probably a Friday.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I think moving forward I have Saturday evenings available, so that might be...

[James]
Saturday evenings? I might also have Saturday evenings available. We'll see.

Depends on how quickly I can switch jobs. But yeah, sometime either like mid...

[Speaker 6]
Nope, no, no.

[James]
I just stopped mid-sentence, because I did it again.

[Speaker 6]
It was just so sudden, and everyone was quiet, but I panicked.

[Nessie]
No, you're fine.

[James]
Yeah, see, I knew that they were in there.

[Nessie]
What are you looking at snakes for?

[James]
Oh, because a Texas tomboy found a rough green snake at Lick Creek, which is funny, because New Jersey also has both varieties of green snake. It has the rough and the smooth green snake, and I was bitten by one of them when I was ten... ish.

I was on the younger side, but it was very adorable.

[Frogitha]
We have little green snakes.

[James]
They're very cute.

[Frogitha]
Very tiny green snakes in North Carolina. And I used to grab them as a kid and play with them, because they're so small and docile.

[James]
Like, look!

[Frogitha]
They didn't want to be handled, or they didn't have a choice.

[Heart]
How big were they?

[James]
They were about the size of... If you're looking at my virtual camera thing, they're that size.

[Heart]
I actually have a picture of one that I captured.

[Frogitha]
I always wanted one as a pet, and my dad finally caught one for me, and then an hour later, I was like, we have to let him go. I can't do this to him. He felt too bad?

[Heart]
Yeah.

[James]
I'm going to leave this on. Anybody will be able to... Anybody will be able to download this for the next week or so.

I'm also going to download a copy. My backup is going to be... So if you're using that basically to download your character sheets and stuff like that, or copy things down from character sheets, shit that you want to remember, that's totally fine.

World Map is still open. If you have questions about the World Map...

[Speaker 6]
You can steal Cara's sheet.

[James]
Yeah. That's what I'm doing. What I'm going to do is I'm going to reload, or I'm going to...

At some point next week, and I'll give Cara a warning beforehand, I'm going to wipe the entirety of this server. I will host a... I will have a local backup on my Foundry v12 installation, but for this one, I'm going to devote it just completely to Pathfinder, so there's going to be a lot less...

There's going to be a lot less crap that's slowing down load times. Which is fine, because I'll have a dedicated place to put player tokens, so they're not getting super spread out.

[Speaker 5]
And I'm drawing Cara a new one as we speak. Are we persisting anything to the new characters? Gold?

Inventory? Anything?

[James]
Nothing in your inventory. Your memory will be... Your memory will be intact.

But for Session 1... Right. For Session 1, the thing that's intact is your memory.

Very good.

[Heart]
I imagine the starting equipment and golden stuff will be handled much later. Right?

[James]
Right. That's when we're doing like Pathfinder 2nd Edition character creation. Yeah.

So I gotta set up a... The character creation guideline is going to be a lot easier. It's going to be follow the rules.

And here's a brief reference to where those are, and where you can do the character builder. Because Pathbuilder is like really, really easy to use, and it actually lets you set up stuff. It lets you set up stuff in advance for like, hey, here's what your character will look like.

It lets you plot out your character build in advance, which is interesting.

[Heart]
It's real nice, honestly. That's part of the reason when transferring to PF2 it took so long, because I'm just like, but what if I just did everything?

[Speaker 6]
I will highly recommend that you don't get too attached to things. Oh yeah, no.

[Heart]
I did make sure that if stuff happens, I'll just alter it. It's a guideline, rather than the hard rule.

[James]
Right.

[Heart]
You as well.

[James]
Thanks again, Bar.

[Frogitha]
I'm just going to take one last look at this map.

[Speaker 6]
I also am willing to take a look at anyone's sheet if they're not sure about certain things. Oh, thank you.

[James]
Because you don't have to translate everything perfectly one-to-one. You have the option of being like, alright, this is a chance to change up how things happen.

[Speaker 6]
Now that Para is in Pathfinder, I can make her in Azamar, where she wasn't before. And so now that's why she has wings and a halo. Is she going to be humanoid then?

No. Because in Pathfinder, Azamar is add-on to your ancestry. It's a heritage.

So I can be a kobold and an Azamar, and it's great.

[Frogitha]
And I'm so excited.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, Para's going to be an Azamar now.

[Nessie]
Or a Nephilim. Hold on, were you always a child of the god? We're...

Otter and I are using the reset as like, they come back differently or a little bit different.

[Speaker 6]
Re-flavor it. I'm going with the sense of like, well, she reached level 20 for her god. So that is where the divine thing comes from.

[Speaker 7]
That's cool.

[James]
This is the only character I've had reach level 20 in my history of Westmarches. That is such a cute fucking snake. Look at him.

[Heart]
Yes.

[Frogitha]
He was not happy.

[Heart]
He longs for the outside. Do you see how he stares? I know.

Bless him.

[James]
This is also a really good picture. Hm? That's a look of yearning.

[Frogitha]
I took this shortly before I let him go. I couldn't keep him. I would feel way too bad.

He knew freedom his entire life. Couldn't take that from him.

[Heart]
If anything... How fond are you of birds?

[Frogitha]
I love birds.

[Heart]
Pigeons are free and they are great pets.

[Frogitha]
We domesticated them and then abandoned them. You know, right? I feel so bad.

I want a pigeon. I'm trying to talk my mom. She wants a bird so badly.

And so I'm trying to talk her into settling for a pigeon. It's not a parrot. But it is a bird.

[James]
Parrots are terrorists. Functionally. A pigeon is a delightful creature.

[Frogitha]
My mom wears an eyepatch. So it's only appropriate that we get a parrot.

[Heart]
I see. For the aesthetic.

[Frogitha]
Yeah.

[Heart]
Pigeons are fantastic. Oh! I see.

[Frogitha]
Well, I have to go take the cash out. It's dark and cold.

[Speaker 9]
I'm sorry.

[James]
Yeah, I'm getting ready to head off to work. If there are additional questions, then send them in the chat. I'll do plenty of server announcements when I'm starting the next game.

I am going to request a bunch of people to assist me with either running the game or the Foundry server subscription or stuff like that. But that'll be easy stuff. yeah, there's just going to be the tutorial dungeon.

And that'll make it easier for you folks to travel to other places and get started back. It'll be a little bit, I guess we're starting December, then it will be slightly before the very, very beginning of The Chill. So basically, you'll have a few months of lead on the beginning of Book 1.

Which will be fun, because then you guys get to see what happens before the module is beginning. One of our stretch goals that we just barely missed, but thank god that we missed it, because I didn't really need one additional thing for my co-writer to leave on my head, was the lower level adventure, because the starting level for the module is 8, and the lower level adventure was Banassus being the first Winterfey to come back. So that'll be fun.

That is the extent of my spoilers for the day.

[Frogitha]
I will see you in Pathfinder.

[James]
I'll see you guys later. Peace.

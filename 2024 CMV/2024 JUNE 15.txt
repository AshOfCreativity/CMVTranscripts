[Speaker 3]
The character's a wolfclaw keep. The last thing I remember doing was going fishing for stars with Maya.

[Speaker 2]
I think we had definitely had some sessions more recently, like O'Leil's Ballad shortly after that.

[Speaker 3]
I definitely wasn't one. Yes, that was a while. It was also the last session that...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, what do you think they've been... So Jesse's been ages since we've seen him. What do you think they've been up to in the meantime?

[Speaker 1]
The last thing Jesse did, he spent like a month traveling down to the excavation side for the Wildgate, so he's just really been busy trying to... He's been casting Teleportation Circle to keep and paying people to do that. Maya has been running the establishment in my keep because it's still earning income, so what would have Rana been doing for work?

[Speaker 2]
Rana probably investigating more to see if she could break some cosmic laws and get back to the... Break some cosmic laws and get back to the book of vile goodness. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Exalted Deed.

[Speaker 2]
Book of Exalted Deed. That's unintentional, but I'm definitely not going to grab one.

[Speaker 1]
Vile goodness is a good name.

[Speaker 2]
Nothing's real, it's like, whatever.

[Speaker 1]
It sucks nowadays, it's fucking terrible. Yeah, it's garbage. Try to do anything, it's just all bots.

Yeah, it's just like... Engagement bombing.

[Speaker 2]
I'm straight up being suppressed. I think these bots are here specifically to suppress me. Let's see, Smokeshow.

15, 24. Let's actually start. Okay, so we mentioned earlier that a Fae Lord had come to you, begging you for some assistance.

Begging Jesse for some assistance, because he was one of the few who had not fled. The frost is coming. He's got this absolutely beloved hive of giant honeybees, and he employs a lot of noons to take care of these honeybees, to harvest the honey, and it's generally entertaining.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Respectable.

[Speaker 2]
I think I mentioned previously that it was in the Forest of Firedard. The Sun here. Oh, the Sunflower Balnean Tree.

Very good. You're familiar with the travel rules, so I'll let you go ahead and get your roles together.

[Speaker 1]
I need to make sure all of my character sheets have the old format, because I still don't. I don't know how to use the new format, and it would take too much.

[Speaker 2]
They said, hey, it looks like, check it out, it looks like Pathfinder 2nd Edition, because it has red on it and stuff. It's also a blue-eyed nightmare.

[Speaker 1]
Looks nice. Yeah, it's not functional at all. How far do you mark where I'm traveling to in the forest?

I will edit the, yeah, show text always visible.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. I will edit the appearance of it afterwards. For the moment, I will just put that there.

Okay. One, two, it is south, more south than southwest. Or no, southeast.

I'm retarded. Okay. Just follow the edge of the, yeah, there you go.

Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Very good stats. All right, we might as well just walk. How difficult is traveling through the Sunflower Forest?

It's not much more dangerous than a regular forest, right?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's DC, I think the forest is DC 16 instead of the usual DC 14 for forest, and I'm going to go ahead and doodle here for what it's regular.

[Speaker 1]
Autogym's kind of useless for traveling. Really? He has intelligence skills and he has arcana history, perception, flight of hand.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe some fishing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, we'll do fishing, Jim. All right, let me get the... You can make one check per day.

I think he'll just do the sleight of hand. I'm able to buy some travel supplies before I leave. Mainly the rerolls.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, the travel packs. There are 50 gold pieces a piece.

[Speaker 1]
I'll buy seven. No, that's too hard for me to math. I'll buy 10.

500 gold. Thank you, keep funds. All right, here's...

Uh, so I need five successes, one per day of travel. Fuck's sake, Jim. What's he got, craftsman?

That doesn't help fishing. I guess I'll spend a travel pack to reroll this fishing check. 17, that's better.

Okay, I'll put Rana on vanguard because she has Nott's perception. Easy. I'll put Maia on camping.

She can use survival to establish campsites. And Jesse can be our entertainer. Add some minstrel dice to this one for the glory.

Nice 31. And for Sierra, she can... Tracker is specifically for tracking a creature, right?

It's not for going to a location.

[Speaker 2]
Or is that... Generally, generally, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
She can probably just do some foraging because she is a herbalist. Right, I was looking in the wrong page. That's why I couldn't find anything.

Um, downtime, natural acquisitions. Foraging is five days, so she can do all four checks. First is perception.

Survival, perception. That's bad.

[Speaker 3]
Um, sleight of hand. Or just spend a pack to reroll that one. Again, that's better.

And a nature or survival check.

[Speaker 1]
Serving, beautiful. So that is three successes, one. So that's two successes for the foraging.

And the lowest I've rolled for the rest is at 17. So that's five successes. Beautiful.

Need to do Sierra's herbalist roll. Uh, three successes for a... No, two successes for a...

That's a rare table roll. Now the foraging tables in... How do I add them to...

[Speaker 2]
Just briefly, it sounds like you're cutting in and out.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I'll move my mic a bit closer. Um, for foraging, uh, two successes is a roll on the rare table, right? Yep, or two rolls on the common.

Yep, um, are the rolling tables in the boundary, or do I need to go dig those up? Just go ahead and roll 2d20.

[Speaker 2]
Or however many d20s, whichever one you use.

[Speaker 1]
I rolled an 18 for the rare table.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, uh, that's a hunter's cache. Go ahead and roll foraging results.

[Speaker 1]
What was that, sorry?

[Speaker 2]
It's, you say it's foraging results?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
That is a hunter's cache. You roll twice, ignoring results higher than 17.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that is a 12 and a 15.

[Speaker 2]
12 is a capuchroom, which is a well-made and tasty, or can serve as a well-made and tasty, and offers a earthy flavor. Plus three cooking checks. Text me to cook something.

Neat. 15 is a scraber skull, which is the skull of a squirrel that, when blown into it, produces a loud shrieking sound. Unconscious creatures nearby immediately fail a death-saving throw.

A creature can't suffer this effect more than once per day.

[Speaker 1]
Could I please, um, could you please spell out the names for me? Yes.

[Speaker 2]
I'll also be putting the septum records.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. And how many have I succeeded? Everyone, we've got five successes.

That's a hearty rest.

[Speaker 2]
You guys traveled for how many days?

[Speaker 1]
Five.

[Speaker 2]
1500 XP in addition to the rest of the activity of the session.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. And I get to do my, um, green thumb, uh, nature's bounty. Four.

So she would get an herb, and on day four of the travels, that's... Um, that is 2d6 to determine the herb type. Six.

I think that's the one I always get.

[Speaker 2]
What is that, restorative?

[Speaker 1]
I'm pretty sure it is. I'm sure it's restorative. Very good.

It's not, it's only getting used with the thurible anyway, so. Uh, I did see how I get. She got two successes, so she can use, um, thurible for the last pattern.

[Speaker 2]
All right, nope. We're going to delete this scene because it's not working properly. It's bugging out on me.

It doesn't want to, doesn't want to upload. Like, no.

[Speaker 1]
56 doubled to 112 temporary points for Sierra. Beautiful. We have a tank.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. Please work.

[Speaker 1]
Good luck. I just, I only just saw Book of Exalted Deeds. Very good.

Let's quickly double check everybody is rested up. Sierra is. Jim is, because I just did him.

Rana is not. She has not done anything in a very long time, so she should be at full. Maya is at full.

Jesse is at not full. Should be. Um, yeah.

Auto Jim would have been, uh, helping out Professor Dickery at the Dickery docks. Uh, and eventually he would have just wandered off without wanting one day, and he has ended up at Wolfclaw Keep and been roped into this, uh, adventure.

[Speaker 2]
That's extremely believable. Unbelievable character mix.

[Speaker 1]
He is the king of wandering off.

[Speaker 2]
Wandered off shenanigan. Okay, so an image of the Fae that you've contracted. Greetings!

Greetings, all of you. It's a delight to make your acquaintance once more. I did want to let you know, unfortunately, it isn't.

It's though my, my nymphs have been, you know, going forces with the witch, I suppose.

[Speaker 1]
Jesse, uh, responds, how, how did that happen? Did they, they get tempted or something?

[Speaker 2]
I'm guessing they were just bewitched. Uh, okay. Because I don't think she's paying, I think she's also cheap.

Oh, I doubt it was, I doubt it was that. You never know.

[Speaker 1]
Should we be trying to not kill them then, or?

[Speaker 2]
Well, definitely, yes. Well, I'm suspecting that they're tempted. Well, I mean, goodness, kill them.

If you kill them, I can't, uh, engage in any disciplinary action.

[Speaker 1]
Duly noted.

[Speaker 2]
Commoners need to know their place.

[Speaker 1]
So what are we dealing with here, exactly?

[Speaker 2]
Well, the biggest danger is definitely the bees themselves. It appears as though they're the most delightful hallucinogens, uh, being, are coming out of these honeycombs. The witch, I believe, is casting spells for the bees themselves.

And then, of course, there are gnomes with nasty little smoke bombs. I see. And smokers.

Other trouble that they'll inflict on you. I'm afraid it's probably going to be, you know, it's probably going to be difficult. It's probably going to be annoying.

I don't envy you, but I really do appreciate what you're doing for me.

[Speaker 1]
No trouble at all.

[Speaker 2]
Reminds me, if you could figure out some way, and this would be quite difficult, so I don't, I don't blame you if you, I wouldn't blame you for not even trying, but if you could figure out a way to get the witch maybe to, I don't know, maybe to actually move the hive to my hollow, that would be, that would be delightful. I have no idea how to do it. The gnomes keep insisting that I don't have, like, a suitable climb, and they keep, and then they change their story to the idea that, you know, they just didn't like me, which, that was, that was rude.

I don't believe them. The bees love me, because I love them.

[Speaker 1]
How far away is your hollow from this one?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, mine is, is quite literally the next exo.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I'll see what I can do.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, thank you, and I hope you enjoy the enchantment of Goldbeard.

[Speaker 1]
It's his, it's his firearm. Oh, yes, it's definitely, I, I enjoy it. I have enjoyed it so far.

I will enjoy it a lot more once this is done.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely, well, I'll let you get to it then.

[Speaker 1]
Next vlog. Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
This is something I've been doing. I've just been dropping a little, wait, no, I think you see measurement controls when I put them, I don't know if you can see that circle towards the bottom right of the map.

[Speaker 3]
I can. That's one, two, three, um, four, five. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
These are like, um, little gnome-ish looking huts.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, these are gnome huts. These are the beekeeping huts.

[Speaker 3]
There is colored smoke pouring out of their chimneys.

[Speaker 1]
What's the best game plan for me? I kind of want to just fight stuff, but I feel like tricking them is the best way to deal with this. Maya and Jesse are very good at tricking people.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see here, do you have any, no you do, um, you have a, you have a sentient, durable.

[Speaker 2]
I do, yes. Durable is going to respond to your query. Recommend hearing the gnomes first interrogate for which is location.

[Speaker 1]
That is a good suggestion. Um, are there, listening for, like, how, how busy? Is there any movement of people coming in and out of huts?

Is there anything, anyone about?

[Speaker 2]
Right now, you could hear a little bit of activity inside, and you can hear some buzzing towards the, towards the western end of the hollow. And I do mean the west side this time. There's, at the moment, the only two sources of activity here.

Go ahead and make me a perception check.

[Speaker 1]
Rana is on the lookout.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, at 30, yeah. So Rana, while she, you guys were moving along, heard a, like a bump sound. It wasn't quite a firearm.

It was definitely an explosion of some kind, but like, not like the crack of a firearm. Something concussive, but softer.

[Speaker 1]
Perhaps like a smoke grenade.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that would, that would match with the description that you received there.

[Speaker 1]
Um, alrighty, uh, I guess my two talkers are going to approach, I don't know, like, the front door of the biggest building. Is there, like, a door here or something they can go and knock at? Absolutely.

Is anybody home?

[Speaker 2]
Hear the sound of, like, tools ringing from the interior. Some, like, dolls. Hear some hushed, hushing.

Or somebody moves something so that the sign goes up next to the door and says, Who is it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Maia will do the talking here. Hello, we are an emissary of the Sunflower King. We are here to do a well-being check of workers of the forest.

May we have some of your time? Oh, this sounds like a fairy voice. What was the last one who asked for our time?

No fey, all mortal and human here.

[Speaker 2]
You're a fey, you have to tell me.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yes, of course. It's against the law for us to, for a fey to lie like that.

[Speaker 2]
Anyways, we, I'm sorry, but we already gave away our time and a few other things.

[Speaker 1]
Where have you given your time to? That sounds against, uh, uh, union policy to give away all of your time. Whoever has taken it from you could possibly owe you some of it back.

[Speaker 2]
That would be nice. Yes, a witch came by and you hear a muffled, like, you hear, like, a muffled gurgle out of this fellow. New voice appears next to the door, like, Yeah, so we can't really, can't really discuss it.

He forgot about it. Can't discuss, you know, there's things that we can't discuss. There's things that we can't give our time to.

We're going to get back to work, but thanks for the well-being check. Frankly, things suck at the moment, but that's all you needed to know, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
The Sunflower King gives his regards. Jesse turns to Maya. That went about as well as I expected.

[Speaker 4]
Jeez.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm, Serana got up her sleeve. Nothing like that to track. Autogym hasn't...

Perhaps we might have a bit of a look around, then. I think my party will peek a bit further into the map, if that's okay. First instance of movement gets us to about here.

How dark is it here? Is the lighting done appropriately?

[Speaker 2]
It is currently darker inside of the hollow, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Maya will spend two ki to cast Dark Vision on Serana.

[Speaker 2]
Oh wait, no, I think it's showing, like, just regular brightness phase.

[Speaker 1]
Three ki.

[Speaker 2]
Towards the middle of the day. No, it's correct.

[Speaker 1]
Let me just see if Serana's vision... Yeah, no. Maya will cast Dark Vision on Serana for two ki.

Putting her to seven ki. Does nobody ever cast Dark Vision on Serana? She always just has to suffer by her halo light or torch light.

Okay. Vision range 60. Dark Vision.

Very good. I think you're going to make me another perception check.

[Speaker 3]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, there is a weird reflection in the honeycomb over this way.

[Speaker 1]
A reflection of us, or...? At the moment, Rana can only see her reflection. Step slightly closer and point it out to the rest. There's some sort of strange property about this honeycomb, it looks like.

[Speaker 2]
The rest of the party right now does not see it.

[Speaker 1]
It's getting closer. I reveal anything about it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so Rana at this point... I was going to have her a bit earlier as well, but yeah, she's... She's having an episode.

I'm going to have her make an intelligence saving throw. Rana, that's you in there. It's not a perfect reflection anymore.

It's just, it's actually you inside of that honey.

[Speaker 4]
She walks up to it.

[Speaker 2]
It's a retell to move forward. You're submersion there. You've got to get in there.

You've got to get yourself out.

[Speaker 1]
I'm stuck in the honey. We need to free me. Help!

What does the rest of your party wish to do?

[Speaker 2]
Rana at this point is starting to submerge herself in the honey, in the comb.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see... Counter-Charm sucks. Every time I read Counter-Charm, I'm like, this ability is terrible.

Um, Sierra's going to try and grab her and pull her out. Does approaching Rana do anything bad, or is it a contested athletics?

[Speaker 2]
Once you touch Rana, I'm going to need Sierra to make the... I'm going to have her make a perception check. And if she succeeds, then she has to make the saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 17. Does not succeed. Oh, good.

Uh, do I get to try and pull her out?

[Speaker 2]
Same thing. Yeah, so go ahead and make a just contested strength. And Jessie can do a counter-charm.

[Speaker 1]
Um, why is Rana trained in... She failed, thank god. Rana's trained in acrobatics.

She nearly got in there. Um, so Counter-Charm... Uh, is bad.

Let me ping it. Is it missing from my sheet? Did I just...

So, oh no, there it is. Uh, disrupt as an action. You can start a performance.

Friendly creatures, they get advantage on the save. So if she doesn't get to roll a save, then it's nothing. Does Rana get a new save against the effect?

[Speaker 2]
Against the effect.

[Speaker 1]
Because that's what Counter-Charm does. It gives you advantage on any saving throw against being charmed. But for something like Dominate Person, you only make the save under specific conditions.

But if she gets another save, that's good. I will roll it. Thank you.

Um, is Jessie able to add Minstrel Dice to the save?

[Speaker 2]
As per...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Um, I believe that is... Yes, to cause or avoid being charmed.

So if this is a charm, then she, uh, would. Okay, he'll spend two Minstrel Dice. Putting him at five.

There we go. Uh, so that is a total of 29 on the Intelligence save.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that is absolutely a success. Okay, so you are... Rana is free from her compulsion, and Sierra has not come under its effect.

Rana can actually see that there is actually a body in there, but it's not... One, not her. And two, facing inwards.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, don't look at the honey, Rana says. I thank you. I nilly.

Is there any, um... Does any of the other bits of honeycomb give off the same sort of, like, this is possible? Like, is it all the sort of same texture, I guess?

Like, consistency is where I nilly?

[Speaker 2]
It's all mostly the same honeycomb.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
As far as doing this is concerned, like, you were only attracted to that one honeycomb.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Be careful looking. Don't look into the honeycomb.

It could happen again. Uh, what sort of person... No, she's not going to look at the honey.

Nah. Um. I think we're going to move away from the honeycomb and maybe try and get around going to the south.

So I'll move my guys in an appropriate amount of movement. 30. 30.

I can move a bit further. Autogym trailing behind at the back. Is there anything happening down this part of the map?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Okay, so at this point, I'm going to have you... Apologies.

Here's a... So College Station closed all the roads that go into our fucking apartment complex?

[Speaker 1]
Sounds like a pain.

[Speaker 2]
So two things are going to happen. In this area, I want... Sierra and Maya are the first ones up.

I want them to... You can see there are a lot of bees on the ceiling in this area.

[Speaker 3]
I see.

[Speaker 2]
And they're not attacking, but they are just kind of like buzzing about. They're getting a little bit louder as you move closer. But the thing of the note is...

I'm going to... Let's do a perception check. This is...

Some stout. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Bees.

[Speaker 1]
Maya rolled a 15 and Sierra got a 28.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra will notice the 15th. Is anybody in your party immune to surprise or anything like that?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I don't think so. No.

[Speaker 2]
Going out of the box here. It's not over yet. I actually got to roll the tape first.

Oh, okay. Surprise. This is going to be a regular initiative.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful. How do we want to do initiative? Do we just want to have one person from each group roll?

Yeah, add everybody to... Here's what we'll do.

[Speaker 2]
Add everybody to the initiative, but each round we'll have one of them roll. This is what I did for the chase rule. Oh, we've ran a bunch of chase things recently, and I used a modified version of the 5e chase rules that are good enough that I'm going to include them in Chillness Valley.

For this, you're going to choose a character, and they're going to determine initiative here.

[Speaker 1]
Let's go with Maya. She's up the front. 23.

[Speaker 2]
That is successful. Okay, I will let your party go first.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Um... It's a... Like, they're amongst the trees.

Is it like difficult terrain or anything to approach them, or is it just... Um... The trees?

It's just...

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. It's not difficult terrain.

[Speaker 1]
Easy. All right, I'm gonna do some movement first.

[Speaker 2]
These guys have an AC of... They have an AC of 13, so I'm gonna get on the call with somebody real quick.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, I'll do my turn while you do that. Excellent. I have some attacks to roll.

Rana has used her bonus action to activate her animated shield. She is going to cast Word of Radiance with her main action, getting these two closest to her with a DC 19 con save. Is it save or suck?

One that... Yes, it is a save or suck. So the one that rolled 21 is fine.

That is Rana done. Sierra will attack this closest one here twice. Three times.

Clicky.

[Speaker 2]
Not bloody, because it was fine.

[Speaker 1]
Did I... No, I didn't ping that twice. Uh...

Because... What did you say the AC was, sorry? 13, which you hit.

[Speaker 2]
Briefly, before you rolled the rest of those, you actually moved out of the reach of one of these mines.

[Speaker 1]
Did I?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, they have a 20-foot reach.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Maya... No, Maya's shadow stabbed.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, damn!

[Speaker 1]
Jesse would have, though. He stepped back. So this one, I think...

Maybe... Yeah, he would have stepped from that one. Uh...

It's a miss. Okay, um... Sierra needs to roll some damage against that one.

Uh, is it still alive after that?

[Speaker 2]
Apparently. Oh, I think her first claw attack deals max damage, right?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, once per turn she can deal max damage, so... Uh, she'll do another attack. This one also not dealing max damage.

Uh, yeah, for another 12 damage. She'll move down and then try and hit this one next to Rana for max damage. A 23 to hit.

This one dealing... Max. Yes.

Uh, Maya's shadow stabbed and, uh, we'll get to do her... Uh, kunai attacks. First one being, uh, at advantage because of shadow stab.

It's... Uh, a 2d6 for sneak attack. It is 19 damage on the first one.

[Speaker 2]
Pretty bad.

[Speaker 1]
The second attack with a 28 to hit is a 11 damage. Absolutely bad. Auto Jim will follow that up with some thunder gauntlet punches.

His first being at the one Maya has attacked. It's a 24 for 7 damage. And going for the one next to it.

With a 16 to hit that hits, we have 9 damage to it. Which leaves us with Jesse who has his revolvers drawn. He will take the action attack car to shoot the one Jim just punched.

Let's see, 31 damage every b. So it would take an extra one damage because it has one b. That is in the, uh, I've added that in to that 11.

Uh, second attack fires the gun off again. It would take an extra two damage this time for two b's. 14 damage in total.

There we are. Done. I need to make sure Rana's AC is correct.

She currently has a shield and the Book of Exalted Deeds. Yep, we are all good. I am done.

Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I'm going to have the remaining guys attack you obviously. We're gonna have the environment condition go off. Okay, so the b's above you are going to begin immediately like surround each other.

They don't attack you, but they start, uh, grooving up in like this scintillating pattern. I need all of you to make the DC 15 wisdom saving throw as if you were affected by the hypnotic pattern spell.

[Speaker 1]
All right, uh, we'll start with Rana. Sierra, that says who's rolling these. DC 15 you said?

[Speaker 2]
She just makes it.

[Speaker 1]
Jesse will add a d8. His minstrel dice. Pinky d8.

That was a good decision. Maya next. She'll do the same.

Another good decision. And we have auto-gym based gym.

[Speaker 2]
All right, so he's good to go. I'm gonna start with an attack versus the closest. They're just gonna go closest spawn to the majority of these.

Full attack. Jesus Christ. Unreal.

Okay, yeah. This is gonna go versus Rana. That is Amos.

This one's gonna go versus Sierra. Let's have it.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, that is a hit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so the 66 is not gonna fly yet. You only receive the poison damage at the beginning of your turn. Which is interesting because we're doing group initiative, so.

[Speaker 1]
That is the 13 bludgeoning then. She didn't raid. Ugh, worst barbarian ever.

It's okay, I think I lose my temp HP after this fight anyway, so. Um. That is...

[Speaker 2]
That is their turn. We come now to the...

[Speaker 1]
We have another initiative test.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so you choose a...

[Speaker 1]
Now you choose a different character.

[Speaker 2]
Roll initiative. Well, I just have assassin bludgeoning.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra's rolled a six this time, so probably gone second.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled a nine.

[Speaker 1]
All righty.

[Speaker 2]
I'd love to be... I'm gonna have the other assassin blind. No, I'm just gonna have the other assassin blind go against Rana.

Keep it simple.

[Speaker 1]
Fair enough. Miss.

[Speaker 2]
And it's just going to constrict... Sierra the second time that has advantage, because obvious reasons.

[Speaker 1]
I believe that's a hit.

[Speaker 2]
Nine bludgeoning. Then another 20 poison at the start of her turn. Right.

Those two done. That's one.

[Speaker 1]
How much does the lava cost? 19.

[Speaker 2]
That's all the lava's good. Giving the odds for itself a little bit. It's going to use entangling vines.

Uh. Those two. That's six, eight.

[Speaker 1]
That begins. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, nice. All right, that is all of their turns.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Okay, so now Sierra takes 39 poison from the Crescent Strix, right? I'm just gonna type in an easy 39 to apply that to her.

All right, um. Rana's gonna move to here. I'll do movements first.

Okay, I'm done my movements. Rana's going to cast Word of Radiance again. I do not want to measure template.

Conceive for 20 damage. At the two. Thanks to her, I'll be making that.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yes. Doesn't work properly, but.

Okay, very predictable.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. 20 damage for both of them.

[Speaker 2]
One is dead. Sierra is no longer being restrained or grappled.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. Uh, Autogym will step out of the tangle. Is that okay?

[Speaker 2]
It's just, it's not restrained. It's just difficult terrain.

[Speaker 1]
Neat, okay, um. Maya will also step back. Does that trigger an attack?

Not quite. Still with them. Beautiful, okay, uh.

Finish the rest of an Autogym. We'll start some attacks. There's Thunder Gauntlet.

Not very high damage, but the the aggro effect of it's really good, where they have to, they have disadvantage if they don't target him. Only 15, is there a C? Whoops, that shouldn't have had advantage.

What did I roll? A miss on the first one, and a hit on the second one. So it just takes the 12 damage.

Um. Maya will do a 40 foot shadow step. To here.

With her bonus action, then using her kunai, she'll stab at it. She has advantage on the first attack. Because of shadow step.

Uh, sneak attack added in there. 16 damage. That is all of them.

[Speaker 2]
That's why I wasn't applying the little death tag, really. Because I had not actually pressed begin combat.

[Speaker 1]
Ah. That was good. Quick, and yeah.

Rip initiative, that was good. I'm a fan. If only I was...

[Speaker 2]
Like, alright, one person rolled the initiative.

[Speaker 1]
If only I was in control of the entire party for the combat every session. Because that went, that was pretty quick as well.

[Speaker 2]
There should be a character class for that. Um.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, uh, does... Do the bays continue, uh, aggroing, uh, the environmental? At the...on the roof?

[Speaker 2]
At this point, they have calmed down.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, very good. I'm trying to do something.

[Speaker 2]
What is...what was this fucking line?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing else. Um. What were they, like, just...trees? They were just assassin vines.

[Speaker 2]
Just vines that were extra, extra aggro.

[Speaker 1]
They're just vines, and I'm not going to bother harvesting them. I don't think if they're... If it's just an animated tree.

[Speaker 2]
Poisonous. Want to give somebody a rash?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I'm all good. Alrighty, so.

Uh. Do we notice this? Oh yeah, that's there.

Um. Noticing the door, I guess we'll move towards it. Let me read.

Spell tongues. Spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. When the target speaks, any creature...

So because bees don't know our language, I would have to cast tongues on a bee for it to understand me. That's not worth it. Um.

[Speaker 2]
Way of communicating with the bees.

[Speaker 1]
I need to speak to animals. And I have speak to animals. Sierra can cast it, I think.

No.

[Speaker 2]
Oh that's, I called, uh, I didn't know who I was going. I was just like, all right, 9-1-1, fuck it. Yeah, so what are you up to next?

[Speaker 1]
Um. Just double checking my totem warrior benefits. If I have speak to animals at level 3.

I do. Sierra's going to spend 10 minutes. Oh, hang on.

No, it's more than 10 minutes. How long does it take to harvest a creature?

[Speaker 2]
About 10 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. Sierra's going to spend one action and 10 minutes casting the ritual speak with animals. Well, the spell speak with animals as a ritual.

I guess while she's doing that, Maya can go cut up some, uh, vine blight. So she'll roll survival, I guess. That one.

[Speaker 2]
Probably nature is your best one for this, if you have anybody who's good at nature.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Maya's good at both. The, um, scout rogue get expertise in nature and survival. Really good subclass for this campaign.

Um, it's an 18 on harvesting the vine blight. Oh, assassin vine. Sorry, not the blight.

Do not send the vine blights off to me.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Don't worry, you can cast planker. The environmental effect, uh, up here, sorry, small tangent.

You're going to love this. I started adding other environmental hazards just to flush it out. I don't even know if everything's going to make it into the final fixed encounter manual, but I don't care.

It's shit that I could use later in other games. Um, shit like, uh, oh, this is a, this is a bar environmental hazard. Everybody has an additional action for throwing bar stools and glasses and shit like that.

It's, uh, I thought the one for the hollow would be, um, which is much less interesting, but like anything, any kind of like plant-based spells will extend indefinitely, but the spell itself can be, you get to spell it by killing it.

[Speaker 1]
That's cool. Firestorm the plant growth.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It makes sense as well. Like Pathfinder, I really like in Pathfinder that you can counter spells with, um, there's a feat that lets you counter spell a spell if you have an opposing trait spell. So you could counter spell a fire spell with like a water spell, for example, if you have it prepared.

So, um, yeah, it's just really neat. Like a, like Kanna spelling a plant spell with a fire spell. That makes sense to me.

That's the opposed types.

[Speaker 2]
We all, we all understand and nobody needs to like argue about it because we all know our Pokemon types.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Exactly. Um, yeah.

Does anything, uh, happen in the 10 minutes of casting and cutting? Beautiful. Um, Sierra will ask the bees, uh, what they're, she'll try and figure out what's, why the bees are acting strange.

Are they being, I assume it's to do with the, um, hallucinogenics or whatever the, uh, the, the Fae mentioned about the hive. We can talk to some traitors.

[Speaker 2]
The blue caps smoke us during the day. We are sleepy at night. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra will thank the bees for their information and sort of try and, uh, calm them down, I guess. But, uh, they seem pretty calm already. So we can continue onwards.

Who will lead the way? Chief union representative, Maya.

[Speaker 2]
Are you guys stealthing by the way?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. Maybe we should. What's Jim's stealth?

Is he capable of it? He's plus one to Dex. That's Rana that struggles with stealth.

She's wearing half plate. No, we weren't stealth. Uh, knock at, we'll knock at the door.

We'll draw their attention to the door.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, smoke immediately billows out from the other side of the door.

[Speaker 1]
Um, we able to jump back or is it like we breathing it in and we need to make saves? Instinctively the party will jump back from the smoke. Uh, hello, is someone in there?

Maya calls out, um, my based auto gnome who doesn't need to breathe can walk up into the smoke and open the door. The rest, um, will step back a bit further as auto Jim takes the blast.

[Speaker 2]
I like it. I like it a lot. Auto Jim does not need to breathe.

So the effect of this is not going to be.

[Speaker 1]
He only has a resistance to poison though.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not poison. Okay, so he is going to step into, um, we'll do another initiative thingy here. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
I'll add all of my guys in and Jim will be rolling this one. That's a 12. Oh, I'm not mean Lux.

I've played Baldur's Gate.

[Speaker 2]
One of these is carrying hay. That is not listed alphabetically. Truly unacceptable.

Okay. Oh, I will wait to see what they do before I ask questions about them. I kind of didn't want to go first is my, is my problem here.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, they don't have to act first.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I guess they could all just like set up and like wait for actions. Cause the other thing is like, there's still smoke here. It's fine.

Auto Jim, make me a, make me a save for sands. Carry fire. Dexterity saving throw.

He is going to change to intelligence.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, intelligence. He rolled a nat one both times. So, go, let's go auto Jim.

Uh, let's see.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know who gets Ballynok. It's Ballynok, it's me. I did Sierra get that.

Six. That's not political. Oh, intelligence, okay.

[Speaker 1]
And intelligence is the right one, right? Yep, so uh, Maya, Jim, and Sierra all failed.

[Speaker 2]
Rest of the lampents are just gonna fire off a few We have no touches. There's a bunch of things that don't do magical touch twice, so this first one is gonna attack twice. It's still misc.

Unbelievable. Uh, this one, we hate the creature of iron.

[Speaker 1]
Magic item request, what does Jim need? Uh, just plus two plate armor, please, Jim.

[Speaker 2]
The only person I trust with that nowadays, like, now when new people got it, they'll be like, I want to be a tank. It's like, fuck you, play yourself.

[Speaker 1]
Who is that one at? Maya, howie. Um, gee, there's nothing to stop this, she'll take ten.

And the second one... RIP initiative makes it really easy to track things like chill touch as well.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, give your next turn. No, no confusion about it, just next turn. This one is going to move over and is also going to attack, maybe off of Jim?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Come on, Jim.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think at least the AT, at least the natural AT.

[Speaker 1]
Like, if you, if you do hit him, he'll die. I knew you were all a crit, he is cooked. I'm getting into the old standoff, I see.

[Speaker 2]
It's a good move. Legitimate strategy.

[Speaker 1]
It is a good move. It's, if it's my turn, you'll see I'm about to do the exact same thing.

[Speaker 2]
That is, that is their turn. So that is the, uh, personal bomb.

[Speaker 1]
Let me see. All right, so, my genius plan, I shut the door, if possible. And yeah, I'm just gonna...

How can, uh, Rano, like, identify magic, like, a magic effect with, like... How long does fairy fire last for?

[Speaker 2]
Fairy fire, it lasts for like, I think it lasts for like 10 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
For fuck's sake, that's ages. Um, probably more like one. So, this gives us a chance to do some buffing spells.

Rano can cast shield of faith on, or... Hmm, maybe we just send auto-gym in with shield of faith. No, she'll cast that on herself.

Bonus action for shield of faith on herself, she can't heal Maia because of chill touch. Uh, Maia will, um, pull up her cloak of invisibility to turn invisible. How does, um...

Fairy fire reveals her, doesn't it? So, she made her saves, or she's not affected by it?

[Speaker 2]
Fairy fire only does it while you're in the fairy fire.

[Speaker 1]
Maia rolled a save of 14. Was that the DC? DC was 18.

She, she is affected by fairy fire, then.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I marked her as affected earlier. That's why she has that little, uh, picture.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, so does she, um... She's being revealed, then, isn't she? That's how fairy fire works.

[Speaker 2]
You get a benefit from invisibility.

[Speaker 1]
If she moves out, does that fix it? Yes. Neat, okay.

Um, Jesse doesn't have any good spells for this. He... He'll just write an action to shoot any main lock he is able to shoot.

Sierra's gonna move forward. Yeah, that's my turn. I want to rage accidentally and have it end before she does anything.

I need to put Shield of Faith on Rana, and I am all done.

[Speaker 2]
I hear a voice from the heavens. They're just the plants, the bees, humming. Unfair!

Unfair! You see a little bit of light start glowing on the tassel vines nearby. Nothing happens immediately.

And that is... Hit things.

[Speaker 1]
Counting.

[Speaker 2]
Choose your champion.

[Speaker 1]
Um, it's Jim last time. Who is in the fray this time? Let's go Rana.

She is my favorite. Rana got E4. Fuck's sake.

Actually, no, that's good. That's good.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, it is. Now we're gonna approach.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, and Shell Touch ends, so... God, I can't see shit. So they are able to see through the smoke, right?

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Look out for prairie fires. The smoke is gonna attack.

[Speaker 1]
They have, like, a frightening aura, like, in...

[Speaker 2]
They do, but it's only if you start your turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Rana's gonna use her reaction to negate the crit, but a 24 does hit still. Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Stop that! Ow!

[Speaker 2]
Start your turn, and this... Go for it, your shadow assumes. Go for it.

Go this way. We've got the rest of the meanlocks out there. I'm gonna have them teleport.

Now I can attack all through Jim once again.

[Speaker 1]
My boy. Yes. He did hit him before, so he needs to make a con save.

He has advantage on it because of his construct nature. He is all good.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that turns. Nope, I think the other... No, the limp adds are good.

[Speaker 1]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 2]
If you walk into the... They were holding their reaction, so they just... Which I can tell you is just, if you go into that...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's all good.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Rana and the gang.

[Speaker 1]
All righty, time to kill some meanlocks. Uh, so who's starting... How big's their aura?

[Speaker 2]
It is 10 feet, so I think it's gonna catch everybody except for Jesse. Yep, that looks right.

[Speaker 1]
It's a wisdom save?

[Speaker 2]
Indeed, DC 11.

[Speaker 1]
Good job, Maya. What does it do? Ah, that's...

Rana can't fail that one. Neat. Autogym fails.

The aura does not fail. Uh, it's just a regular frightened. Can't move closer.

Oh. Um. Maya would have to roll it twice.

No, because she's in the range of two of them, so like, if they're... I guess it doesn't matter because they're the same distance, the same direction, but if... Is there one, so if...

Sierra failed twice, she would have to... Yes, she wouldn't be able to run towards either.

[Speaker 2]
Oh wait, no, that is important.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's all. So, um, it's really just important for Sierra. It...

She failed against this one to the left, so she can run this way.

[Speaker 2]
She can't go the other way.

[Speaker 1]
Which is fine. Um, she can't see it though.

[Speaker 2]
So it's not like, yeah. You just can't willingly move towards it. You're aware that something dark and scary is in that smoke, but it's not inflicting disadvantage on your attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Um. Maya is within 10 feet of that one as well in the door, so she has failed that one. So she can't move.

She can move like this way. She's going to shadow step like to, um, like back up here. Not looking at the honeycomb.

Okay, uh, who's movements left? Jim is in range of just the one there, and he is frightened. He is going to trigger an attack of opportunity and move past two of them.

Three of them. No, he hasn't left that one's range. Just two.

Very good. Um. I'm just going to step to here.

Jesse will step back to over here, and start killing some menelocks. Okay, so. The only one with disadvantage is Maya, because the rest failed to save against the one in the cloud.

But Maya's hidden, so it'll be a flat roll. Because she has disadvantage though, she can't sneak attack, I believe. All right, I will double check that.

Um. You don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. So she...

Okay, um. We'll start with Maya. She will, uh, drop her kunai and draw her, um.

Yes. And going for the one next to Sierra. Uh, normal attack roll with a 19.

I didn't declare arrows, so we're just sending one. Move to Sierra, who will do some attacks. She'll do her manifest blow claw attack for her first attack.

One does. Excellent. Sierra will cut him in two then with her first attack.

Uh. She can't move really back, so she won't. Stop.

And Rana moved to here. Is that a legal square? Um, it's sort of half.

We'll move to there and do a word of radiance. That's what I get for not taking AoE spells on Rana. She has...

[Speaker 2]
It's so funny to be in parties that, like, are more AoE heavy versus, like, single target heavy.

[Speaker 1]
One of them is going to take no damage. The one that failed will take all the damage. Beautiful.

Auto-gym cannot see his, uh, frightened... Frightener, so he will do two regular punches at this go. Flanking doesn't exist because it's...

Uh. Great damage. Uh, what was our AC?

Sorry, yeah. 11's a miss.

[Speaker 4]
15. Beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Jesse will, uh, shoot that guy. B.

One more attack. 15. That's 1B.

That is 15 damage. Kills it. He can't see...

He can't target the guy in the cloud, so we're done.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I mean, you could shoot them. You just can't, uh, it's just disadvantage to fire at them.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, why not? He'll, um, try and get him. He'll go for the one in the doorway then.

Disadvantage. There you go. They have 1B attached to them.

18 damage. Blows its head off.

[Speaker 4]
And...

[Speaker 2]
Interesting. Okay. Cool.

Is that... is that everybody?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, so I guess we do our next. Round of contested initiative. We'll have Sierra roll for the 15.

That's good. Okay, 2.

[Speaker 2]
Add these to the next round. Don't have these to pay. All these things.

[Speaker 1]
Do I get full XP by killing them again?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no. He's the only opponent.

[Speaker 1]
They go first. How sad.

[Speaker 2]
Now, none of you are currently very far ahead. I think I just need to drop concentration.

[Speaker 1]
Good. Uh, how long does the main lock brighten? Last till my turn or their turn?

Um, fear aura until the start of the creature's next turn, so my turn. What does frighten do? I don't think you get advantage on me flipping.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, I don't get advantage. No, the boulders gave 3 of me and locks were like, cool when hit at the stadium. Actually kind of fucked me up.

My encounter bank, because I was not expecting that shit. This thing will be unparried by... Okay, so to start off, the assassin binds are going to attempt to...

Attack people soon. Yep. Against...

Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
So it's the 13 bludgeoning now and... Well, if she's taking it all... Is the only way...

Is there any way to break the... She'd have to break the constrict before her turn, right? From the start of her turn, so if you have somebody go before her and kill the assassin by...

Nah, I'm just gonna play off the damage now. That's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Third as well, which is...

[Speaker 1]
Um, any round, Rana can use her reaction to negate the crit. I think I'll just double check the range of that feature. Uh, 30 feet.

Oh no. Ah, we're in. Pythagoras doesn't exist.

Let's see. All right, so... 25 and 30.

[Speaker 2]
Those guys... All three of these guys are gonna go after Jesse now. Heck.

Oh, it's... It should have been at advantage, so I'll roll again. Doesn't matter.

And then the last one, it was at advantage. Now I get an extra 20. Okay.

Normal hit first.

[Speaker 1]
Critical hit next. Oh, I have to break this before Jesse's turn, because otherwise... Because otherwise he will have a problem.

[Speaker 2]
I just, uh...

[Speaker 1]
That's 30.

[Speaker 2]
...20 damage and can't launch a move. Is it that bad? It is, yeah, not a bad day.

This meanloft is going to... ...teleport. Tyr is currently grappled and restrained. Yep.

He's back with advantage, and he's infamous. And that is... ...my turn. It's more than need to be medium and bigger, that's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
The one pet is going to run over and close the door.

[Speaker 1]
I would do the same. I'm just not going to hold that chance.

[Speaker 2]
Never mind. Okay, yeah, that is... Oh, I think that's all the meanlofts.

That's all of you.

[Speaker 1]
How much damage did Ciara take? Maybe I shouldn't have applied the poison, because I've just come up with... They look like they're a bit like they're at 1 health, right?

Yeah, they're all at 1 health. They don't come back with full. Um...

But two of them heal to cast, it doesn't matter. What's Jim's highest spell level? Uh...

Two. So that lets him cast... ...four magic missiles. So he can cast... He can hit all of the ones. Only two got Jesse.

Didn't they? How many did he get back? Yep, there were two hits on Ciara and...

...two hits on Jesse. All right, so Jim's going to cast magic missile at... ...second level, which gives four darts. So each of the darts should be enough damage. Yeah, each one deals 12 damage, so that's going to be able to kill all of the blights, right? Is it each one deals 12?

[Speaker 2]
No, I think that's like the total... Is there 1d4 plus 1 for each of them? But in any case, they have one hit point.

They can't evade it, so they're dead again.

[Speaker 1]
Right, yep, okay. Dart deals... I have no idea why it doesn't like that.

Yeah, I don't know either.

[Speaker 2]
Because then I can't individually apply each dart. It just tells me what it is if I multiply it for everything.

[Speaker 1]
It's cool and all, but... Yeah. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
They included the normal thing that works fine. It's... ...in the description, but for some reason when they roll for damage, it does not do it.

[Speaker 1]
Um... That kills them all again, right? So Sierra doesn't actually take her poison damage, so I'm going to give her back that, which was 19.

And two. E and four temp HP. Okay, um...

What's now? Now I can do the rest of my group initiatives. No, I can keep doing them one at a time for now, because Maia can go next and kill the mainlock.

She would not be frightened anymore because she didn't start within its aura. She can just send the operator crossbow with like five bolts at a... That one misses second attack.

15, there's their AC. Uh, we have an extra 4d6 plus... No, 6d6 for sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Kills it. Wait for it to physically survive that.

[Speaker 1]
Now we can return to... ...uh, regular group initiative. Jesse...

Not that much else is going to happen. Jesse's going to cast, uh... ...um, healing word on himself, a second level slot.

[Speaker 2]
So you know there is one assassin bind that is still on.

[Speaker 1]
It's a bonus action spell. Jesse's going to shoot it. Hell yes.

Easy. I assume, uh, it dies. Very good, um...

He heals for 10, I need to apply that. It's healing. Just missing Rana.

Maybe you can cast... Jesse, you'll need to move towards Rana. Does moving back into fairy fire trigger it again, or is it instantaneous?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's only while you're in the area of effect. That's why one spell appears.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
It's an extra d8 because all of Rana's spells are upcast. Jesse is healed back to full. We can send the brave gnome back into battle.

Is there a way to easily remove conditions? Oh no, yes, there is. Continue to pathfinder because they will show up on the top left when you have tokens.

In the top right. Um... There we are.

My mighty, my champion of the people. My lovely auto-gym is going to open the door and get peppered by whatever they've got held.

[Speaker 2]
They actually can't see him right now because they can't see through the smoke.

[Speaker 1]
Champion, he is going to step one step forward onto the corpse of Amin. I think. Yes.

That is my turn. I put him up one foot high. Oh, that didn't help at all.

Um, he hasn't rolled. Maya's turn. Maya rolled a excellent.

Uh, the gym can't see shit, but he's gonna try and walk forward, I guess, and be blocked, obviously. It looks like it's a bit narrow passage through here, so he'd have to fumble through to get by. Is that correct?

He'd have to shove it aside for marketing, obviously. But he can point it out, so he will do that and say it is in front of me here, so the rest can target it with attacks. Blue movement first.

Can't shadow step somewhere you can't see. Um, the smoke's blocking light, like, like, I can't see these people up the back, right? The smoke's blocking all vision through this doorway.

[Speaker 2]
So you have to murder the, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Um, fortunately, nobody has any means of blowing it away.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe him pillows.

[Speaker 1]
No, fortunately not.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the baseline. Wait, no, no, I inputted this one. What does your party wish to do?

[Speaker 1]
Um, okay, so we're just gonna have attacks, uh, blind attacks going at the... Now, auto-gym's also in the smoke, so they can't see him, right? So it's flat rolls.

[Speaker 2]
I'll jump in, like, attack, and then, like, all of them blind.

[Speaker 1]
That, that's fine. I'm, because, because Jim is blinded, he would have disadvantage. Because they're blinded, it's a flat roll, I think?

Is that... Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I remember thinking about this. Um, sure.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so he has his Thunder Gauntlet. Uh, this is a 16 hit.

[Speaker 2]
16 does hit, AC 15.

[Speaker 1]
And we have two hits, so, uh, 20 damage. Uh, Thunder. Now, we have the same situation for Maya, because she is invisible.

But she can't see them. Well, they can't see it because they're in the cloud, so I guess invisibility doesn't matter. She's going to fire the operator's crossbow with five bolts.

She can't sneak attack. Because she has an instance of disadvantage on the roll. That's damage roll.

I didn't roll an attack roll. Uh, 15 to hit.

[Speaker 2]
Now, if you were to teleport through this, you could then use the operator's crossbow again, if you had bolts, or a regular crossbow, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I think, I think Shadow Step is vision.

[Speaker 2]
Right, but you would just have to go into the, you just have to go into the smoke and then forward.

[Speaker 1]
Well, specifically to a shadow she can see. So, because she can't see anything in the smoke, I don't think she can see.

[Speaker 2]
The smoke is shadow. It passes shadow.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what's her movement speed?

[Speaker 2]
You also just walk through it. Yeah, she probably has enough movement speed to just walk.

[Speaker 1]
Not quite, unfortunately. Um, she can teleport into the smoke then, and she'll step through. Uh, she's invisible, but she's not hiding.

So, uh, that's a bad idea. She'll stay in the smoke.

[Speaker 2]
You have advantage after your first attack.

[Speaker 1]
She's still in, yeah, no, she'll... How much movement do I have? I need to, sorry.

Um, so there is, she's moved 35 feet. She can teleport 60. So, she can teleport into the smoke.

That is, she's used 40 feet of movement. She has 10 feet left after this. She'll walk to here.

She is invisible and shadow stepped. So, she can just shoot one of them with advantage and sneak attack. As long as, yeah, she'll shoot this closest one here.

[Speaker 2]
This is the one wielding B3.

[Speaker 1]
That is a 23 to hit. With five bolts and sneak attack, that's an extra 66 damage. 36 damage.

[Speaker 4]
Still alive.

[Speaker 1]
We'll then move... Oh, that's into the wall. Back onto the corpse of this one.

Good. Um, yep, that's my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see if my pass will go. This one is going to cast a... Blast.

I'm going to have you make me a constitution saving throw. You see, it...

[Speaker 1]
Damn.

[Speaker 2]
Is Maia the opulence, or is Maia the...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, she's a minstrel, yeah. Sierra would need to be closer to abdice this one. 16 damage.

Ouch. If only it was a dex save.

[Speaker 2]
So, they're going to make blind fires into the center here. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Maia's AC is 18.

[Speaker 2]
Second one. We're just going to let the rest of them run around. Okay, that's all of them.

I'm going to have them make a morale check. A fail. They're going to begin running.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
Succeeded. You are, of course, free to give chase.

[Speaker 1]
No, we'll, um, follow them. Later. Regrouping for now is probably best.

Um. Luckily, Urana is a heal bot, so she can cast a cure wounds on Maia. She is pretty good.

Alrighty, um. My gang will, uh... Maia will take the cloak off, sorry, so she can be targeted.

Um. She'll get healed. There we go, okay.

And, uh, they will step through the smoke into this next area. That's tricky.

[Speaker 2]
So this room is pretty simple. There are doors. Two things are of note.

First, there are a bunch of shining objects that have been deposited into the honeycomb. The second is that a portion of the honeycomb that you can see appears to reveal a wooden structure behind it. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Maia is going to spend two ki to cast Pass Without Trace. I'm going to roll some stealths. Situational bonus of 10.

Jesus Christ. No, Jim has disadvantage. Whoopsie.

He rolled the same both times. It's fine. Uh, here's Sierra's check.

We have Jesse. Rana can cast the spell, uh, Borrowed Knowledge, which gives her proficiency in stealth for an hour. She can then roll stealth with disadvantage for a total of 20.

The lowest I have rolled is a 20. The highest is 43. Keeping our lights dimmed, Rana will turn off her halo.

We'll, um, stick to the wall and the shadows and move up to, uh, each turn around and slide off. There we go. Uh, I can't really see...

I can see the door icon down here, but I can't tell, uh, what the door itself looks like. Is it, um...

[Speaker 2]
It's just, uh, same as the others, which is kind of like this wooden thing.

[Speaker 1]
We'll sneak up to it and... Is there a way to look through the door?

[Speaker 2]
...items in the honeycomb button?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, um, that's right. Uh, how hard would it be to break it out? I was thinking, uh, order Jim could use his, like, smith's tools to perhaps, uh, crack it open and retrieve...

What sort of items is it?

[Speaker 2]
I think it would be gems and coins.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, Jim will, uh, crack some of it open and try and get at it, if that's possible. He has a hammer and, uh, thieve's tools and a knife and things that I think could pierce honeycomb.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's not difficult. There is... And is he resistant to the poisoned condition?

Yes. I didn't have that make me a constitution saving.

[Speaker 1]
Um, so he gets advantage on this. 22.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, there are a lot of gems.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
And there are 1,200 platinum pieces, which is, uh, a lot.

[Speaker 1]
Holy fuck. 1,200 platinum? What else was this?

Sorry?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, for the gems, I'm dropping that in here. Okay, so it's going into the section with this.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful. Damn. Jim's making some money.

Uh, how long does that take, Jim?

[Speaker 2]
Probably enough for me to roll, like, another random encounter check.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, sure. Uh, while he's doing that, um, I'll leave, uh, Sierra there to watch him, and I'll have, uh, Rana, Jesse, and Maya, uh, creep up on this door and open it, if that's okay. Still, like, trying to keep to the shadows as best as possible.

Yes, I understand their stealth checks don't actually make them invisible.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, go ahead and make me a, uh... You already made a stealth check, I think, earlier.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, uh, the three that are here, Jesse got a 32, Rana got a 20, and Maya got a 43.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so you creep in, uh, you are going to find... When you creep in here, you're going to see an effigy, it's been given moth wings, six moth wings, as opposed to its regular wings, and you can see a small fairy crying in front of it.

[Speaker 1]
Um, could Rana please do a insight check to see if there, like, any telltale signs of, like, deceit in this fairy's crying behavior? Yes. 13.

[Speaker 2]
It's not difficult, um, it's not subtle at all, like, the cries are exaggerated, and they're clearly intended to yank someone in. And you get the feeling that something else lies in the combs.

[Speaker 1]
How long before AutoJim's done? Is this in sort of the middle? Is he busy?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, this is in the middle.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 2]
He could be finished now if you'd like him to. I've already accelerated the clock.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, uh, they'll, uh, take... they'll just wait for Jim to be ready, and I think, uh... Yeah, I think we're going to shoot first, ask questions later with this one.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, that should be fine.

[Speaker 1]
Um, are they aware of my presence? Do we get a surprise round on them, or...? You will get a surprise round. Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Some of them are hiding, though, so you have to detect them.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, okay. I guess I'll, um... do you want me to do an initiative then, or...? Because if they go first, I think they would, um, not be surprised.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so if they go... I mean, it might have, um... If they're surprised, then they don't get those.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, um, well, I'll have Rana try and spot people. She'll be spending her turn doing a perception check, uh, looking for any hidden people in the room. She'll, um, she'll move well forward for this.

[Speaker 2]
What was Rana's perception there?

[Speaker 1]
34. It's the emote itself.

[Speaker 2]
And 7. Okay, so what Rana sees is there are boggarts. I don't know if you're familiar with these creatures.

You've faced them a few times before, sometimes in parley, sometimes in combat.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
The boggarts, which are, again, they're the twig creatures that are sort of, like, telekinetically held together by spirit. And, uh, they're a lovely little mass. However, each one of them has a giant bee inside of their body, which I am using a giant wasp.

By inside of their body, I mean, like, they're, like, the wings are on the outside, the stinger is still visible, and they're effectively acting as two creatures. Or, well, effectively acting as the same creature.

[Speaker 1]
So they are cooperating with each other.

[Speaker 2]
One is wearing, one is wearing the other's armor.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, and that doesn't resemble.

[Speaker 1]
Um. These fuckers are each other. The rest of my surprise round, though, all of the attacks are going to be targeted at the fairy.

Yes, completely.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's totally fair. The encounter is available.

[Speaker 1]
Um, so I'll do the rest of my surprise round, and then we'll get started with the actual initiative. Is that it?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to put one as petrified here, and that will be the actual visible totem to the city.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, Maia is going to fire the operator's crossbow. She has advantage because she is hidden at the fairy.

She'll fire five bolts. A 25 to hit. Sneak attack triggering.

An extra 66 damage on top of the regular damage. 32. She'll do it again.

Uh, she, her first attack. Nice. It's a crit.

Sad this isn't sneak attack. Another, um, five bolts. 46.

A crit that gets doubled. Do it for me. Jesus Christ.

Okay. Uh, the second attack is 55 damage.

[Speaker 2]
Doing pretty bad there.

[Speaker 1]
The, uh, final, uh, part of my surprise round. Sierra is going to run in and claw it up. She'll bonus action rage.

Feature.

[Speaker 4]
Rage.

[Speaker 1]
And she'll, uh, claw it up with her two attacks. The manifest will claw attack first. Uh, would she break stealth moving from the door to attacking?

[Speaker 2]
I'm still bloody still surprised. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I'll do one more attack roll for that one with a crit. Jesus. That isn't done correctly.

Um, I guess it'd be double or no, it wouldn't. It'd be eight plus six plus eight plus six. Yeah.

So the five wouldn't get doubled. So it'd be 14 doubled to 28 plus five. So, uh, 33.

[Speaker 2]
Begin combat.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. So for first round of combat, Maya has rolled a 10. I feel like Sierra is about to get stung by a lot of bees.

Do giant bees work like regular bees or if they sting something, they die?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's a good question.

[Speaker 1]
Surely they're a bit more durable, but their insides don't get ripped out. They must be.

[Speaker 2]
They must be. This is the purpose of this. So they are going to go first.

Yep. They're going to have a boggart.

[Speaker 1]
Tank, tank, tank. That is a hit. Oh, six damage.

Oh no, I had everyone selected. Uh oh. Okay.

I need to heal everyone. Six accepts here. Um, four, five, and 51.

Beautiful.

[Speaker 2]
Just going to attack that. Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
This one's flying up. I'm going to do the person who needs to run first. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Roll attack.

[Speaker 1]
You have shield of faith up, so her AC goes back down to 20. All the way back down to 19, she wouldn't have a shield up either. That one's a hit.

[Speaker 2]
And then have her make me a DC 11 con save.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, she could have raised her shield on the surprise round, but that would still hit. Um, con save? Yes.

Yeah, she's out of her dice range. That's bad.

[Speaker 2]
Just damage. And then if that knocked you out, then it would give someone the additional annoying stuff. All right, so I can pursue Maia.

One more. That hits.

[Speaker 4]
That's a hit.

[Speaker 2]
Then an ace. Being attacked versus Maia. Not hit.

Cool. And then we have the remainder there to go. Maia.

Here.

[Speaker 1]
All good. Normal attack. Miss.

[Speaker 2]
18. This Boggart is going to take the help action to get the other Boggart. Give the other Boggart advantage.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. That's a hit.

[Speaker 2]
So that makes that a lot more simple.

[Speaker 1]
19. She halves that to 9. Ah, she would.

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, and that is all the turns.

[Speaker 1]
All right, um, let's have a Sierra roll initiative this round. A 22. Okay, one save.

One more.

[Speaker 2]
You still get your surprise round.

[Speaker 3]
They went ahead of you.

[Speaker 2]
You got your surprise round, and now it is your turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, right. Fuck, I forgot. I forgot my roll.

Yep.

[Speaker 2]
I have the Boggart give his Wasp advantage on the attack.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
I love doing this shit. I should do this way more often. Have the number of attacks double the, roughly damage the number of actually.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Rana reaction will negate that.

[Speaker 2]
All right, she's, man, she gets to use a lot of those. All right, go ahead and make yourself a con save.

[Speaker 1]
She gets them equal to a wisdom modifier, so she's used half now. Uh, con save? Uh, she'll bend a herb dice.

She's bent two. I'll bring that to 15.

[Speaker 2]
All right, so you take half the poison damage, so 6, and then you have piercing, so it's 11 instead of 18.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so it's 2 piercing and 3 poison, so that's 5 damage. Very good. All right, so now it's my turn.

Uh, okay, um. I'll target the Boggarts first to see if that, um, frees the bees from aggroing me. Maya will, uh, drop her crossbow and draw her returning kunai, and I can't target them.

She'll, no, I've got one. She'll go for the bottom Boggart first. What space is it in?

Is it within? It's within 5 feet of Sierra, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
So she would have sneaked back on this one.

[Speaker 2]
I just have them slightly separated. It's...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so this will have an extra 2d6. Does the Boggart survive 13 damage?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Boggarts should have... I'm sorry, um, Boggart should have 14 hit points.

[Speaker 1]
Goddammit, okay. She'll, um, do her second attack at the Boggart above. I can't target it, but they, um...

It's the one between her and Rana. Um.

[Speaker 2]
That's negative.

[Speaker 1]
There's a 14 hit it.

[Speaker 2]
14 does hit. AC 14.

[Speaker 1]
10 damage, and she'll, uh, kick the... Say, she'll kick that one with just an unarmed strike for her bonus action. A 26 to hit.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm going to hit 5.

[Speaker 1]
I apparently rolled damage before the attack, but there we are. Oh. Well, 6 damage is fine.

It's going to kill either one. So, uh, kill that fucker. Free the bee.

And, uh, Sierra with her speak with animals that's still active will just call out to the bee. Bee, um, control yourself. Okay.

Jesse, uh, will shoot the Boggart that's alive still. Uh. Oh, it's not.

I rolled. Garbage. What did you mean the one that's, uh, which one are you targeting?

Yeah, no, it had like three health. Yes, one health. Easy.

Second attack on this Boggart back here. Playing a bard that shoots stuff, this is the best. Jesse's awesome.

Fourteen. Thank you, Chris Avalone.

[Speaker 2]
It's just there, AC.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful. It has one bee, so just one extra damage for 12. Uh, with his bonus action, he can do an offhand attack with the Hornet's Nest.

Uh. He doesn't need to fan the hammer. 19.

That is 10 damage. It's toast. Another free bee.

Uh. Yes. Autogym, late to the party, will, uh, move through his friends.

And he's gonna take bee stings if he, if they want to. He doesn't care.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they don't, uh, they don't attack me often.

[Speaker 1]
Free bees are chilling out? Good, good. I didn't want to have to kill a bunch of bees.

Autogym is gonna punch this Boggart. His Thunder Gauntlets. He can't move any further, so they're both gonna be at it.

We have two hits. For 22 damage. Knocks its socks off.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody left on your team.

[Speaker 1]
We have Sierra left. She has her attacks. She'll attack one with her Manifest Blow attack.

I don't think it's gone.

[Speaker 3]
Has she?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, you're right. We'll see if she needs to. This one deals max damage.

19, killing the first Boggart. Second, uh, it's just a claw attack. 23 to hit.

When you hit a crit, she can do Forged Heart as well. She'll do her Forged Heart attack with some Ki. Uh, which is a saving throw, but the main thing is that they take, uh, 2d6 damage, or half, on a save.

So they take, um, they take 24 damage from that, which should kill them.

[Speaker 2]
Good. All right, you are out of initiative.

[Speaker 1]
Um, Sierra's gonna ask these, these, how hard it would be for them to move their hive a hex over.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we've never been able to.

[Speaker 2]
We would have to follow our queen. We don't know where she is. She's here, we just don't know where.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, um.

[Speaker 2]
We just said, tell us she's nearby.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, the lot of you should rest and stay safe. Work together if anything tries to take you again, like these Boggarts did. Okay.

Any, um, gems and walls or anything of the sort? Uh, is there a Boggart here that missed out on going? Yeah.

Rada can send a Guiding Bolt at him if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
Here, uh, sure.

[Speaker 3]
Expend, expend a spell slot will resolve the damage. This giant wasp is the, is the totem. Ah, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Is it, it's, yep. Um, Sierra will, um, make it more bee-like and remove the moth features. Hopefully that doesn't inflict a Vine Wrath.

Uh, 19 damage on the Guiding Bolt. Uh, sorry, uh, Arcana or?

[Speaker 3]
Religion, both bad. That is a five on the Arcana check. I've had it rolled, David.

Um. Like, stung in your hand. She would not be raging still.

Play.

[Speaker 2]
Check her Witch's Cackle as the totem falls apart.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, does she make the con save here, or does she just take it all because she failed the? She's, she's, yep. Um, apply damage.

Okay, we need some healing.

[Speaker 3]
Auto-gym can hit, uh, Sierra with a second level. Your Roots.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, who is hurt? Jesse doesn't have a health bar, he's fine. Auto-gym's missing a little bit.

Maya's missing a little bit. Sierra's pretty hurt still. Runner's gonna put another heal into Sierra with a fourth slot.

[Speaker 3]
Very good. Um, Jesse is going to put a healing word into Maya with a third slot.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, um, yeah, we'll calm the bees down. Sierra will recover from messing with the altar, and we'll, uh, I didn't roll concentration checks for Maya. My bad.

She loses concentration easy. All right, she's gonna spend two more ki, casting Pass Without Trace again. Putting her to three ki.

I'm gonna move my guys back into this room and roll the checks again, just there's less token. Believe that's all five. And we're gonna head, uh, we're gonna head up towards the store and roll the checks.

Jesse with a 38. Runner has disadvantage. She is still trained in stealth because it lasts for an hour.

Don't have to concentrate, she rolled for 19. Jim is not trained in stealth and has disadvantage with a 30. He rolled 219.

Who's Jim's knight? He rolled the same as Maya with a plus 23. Alrighty, my lowest stealth is a 19, my highest is a 38.

With one instance of movement, I can get to the next door. It worked so well, I'm gonna put Jim at the front. He's such a good door opener.

[Speaker 2]
This door is locked.

[Speaker 1]
Um, magically or is there a, like, mundane lock? It's a mundane lock. Well, I, Jim's trained in sleight of hand and he has thieves tools, excellent.

Door opener, open door. He has rolled an 11.

[Speaker 2]
He has rolled an 11, that is sufficient.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, very good, Jim. Uh, quietly opening the door, we will stick our little heads in.

[Speaker 2]
You can see the light of the thrift globe from earlier inside.

[Speaker 1]
Maya is going to put her cloak on of invisibility and creep forward to get a better look.

[Speaker 2]
You read Lempats from earlier resting. It is a ghostly form hovering about inside this section of what you can now see is a ship. A wooden ship that has been deposited here is very broken up.

[Speaker 1]
I see. We're a bit of the ways from any water. It's a couple days to the, to the lake below Bronlock, so.

[Speaker 2]
This is a ghost hovering about. It has a pirate hat.

[Speaker 1]
Ghosts aren't necessarily hostile, are they? Nope. These guys, I hate them.

Rockfairy fire, bastard spell. Uh, what are these guys now that Maya has a chance to look at them? Are they some sort of a creature or a plant or?

[Speaker 2]
Gotta make an Arcana check.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. 14.

[Speaker 2]
14. These are, eh, they're a little less known to you. I'm gonna say, yeah, I'm gonna say it's insufficient.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. With her 30 in stealth, Maya's gonna whisper to the others that she's going to sneak up behind them and, and will attack them when they begin combat. So the others will no longer have, um, pass without trace and they're stealthed.

Then Rana has a 9 in stealth, so that'll probably trigger the fight. So I guess Maya, can Maya have, Maya alone have a surprise round? Yeah, that seems possible.

So Maya's gonna try and sneak. It'll take her two rounds of movement. Oh no, she can dash as a bonus action and get up to here and shank one of them as the rest burst in.

[Speaker 2]
I think the idea is that you're probably crawling around the, um.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
So the ghost is aware of you. He is looking directly at you, like, once you make contact with the ship, but he doesn't say anything.

[Speaker 1]
Maya, um, does the, like, finger to her lips for, like, the shush motion. And once she is in position, uh, she would have told the party to wait about 10 seconds before bursting in. They will.

Begin in combat as she stabs one.

[Speaker 4]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Maya didn't pick up her crossbow after last fight. It's still back in the B room. You did not leave your crossbow behind.

Thank you. Um, I'm gonna roll a little stab and then we can, I'll roll initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that sounds good to me.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, a 19 hits these guys. It is sneak attacked. 2d6.

Or 20 damage on this guy. Damage hits. Uh, does something else?

[Speaker 2]
Hurts a lot?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. She is still invisible, but they are aware she is there. Um, and I'll have, I guess, Maya roll initiative, if that makes sense.

A 14.

[Speaker 2]
Lampad, roll. Guess misses.

[Speaker 1]
All right, the party goes first. Wait, Maya's gonna stab him again. They can't see her, so I assume they can't see her because she's invisible.

Um, where'd it go? I need to organize my inventory better. I played Baldur's Gate with Caleb and, um, he was so upset with how unorganized my inventory always was.

Hahaha, I'm really good. Another sneak attack, 18 more damage for the same one. Is it alive?

Kills it.

[Speaker 2]
The drip load goes to hover to a new Lampad.

[Speaker 1]
Which one does it go to?

[Speaker 2]
Just the one on the top.

[Speaker 1]
Stabs and stabs.

[Speaker 2]
Appears to have additional hit points.

[Speaker 1]
Um, a 22 to hit. This one can't sneak attack. Bonus action, she'll kick it in the head.

Now we have the rest of the gang. Um, auto-gym, activate. He can get to there, that's perfect.

Rana will activate her shield with her bonus action and move in. Uh, Sierra can spend a key to dash. Um, she should be.

Hello? Hi. Wait, no, that's right.

Um, she'll dash. It's Jessie. Whoops.

Uh, she'll trigger an attack of opportunity. She'll bonus action dash, yes, and trigger an attack of opportunity from this guy. If they have a melee attack, they can do.

[Speaker 2]
Who's getting the attack of opportunity?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this guy here, the one next to Jim as Sierra runs past.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra's AC is 18. That is a miss. Okay, now I'll roll some attacks.

I have Sierra. She's going to hit this guy with two, um, floor attacks. Uh, the first being Manifest Blow.

She doesn't have advantage because she wasn't hitting the 20 to hit. It does the full damage of 19.

[Speaker 2]
Looking pretty bad.

[Speaker 1]
Follow it up with one more floor attack. Nine damage.

[Speaker 2]
Pulls it. The blow goes over to the next person and gives them a load with a temporary hit point.

[Speaker 1]
Jim's going to start laying into him. But they miss and hit. This guy now has disadvantage on attack rolls on other targets than Jim until the start of Jim's next turn.

Uh, we have Runner, who is going to hit it with a Toll the Debt. I know James loves it when I use cantrips instead of my high level spells.

[Speaker 2]
In this case, it's still okay.

[Speaker 1]
I need to make a... it needs to make a Wisdom. Oh, whoops, it's injured.

Didn't delete that. 30, much better. I think it's gonna make this one.

Yeah, 30 damage. Necrotic damage, if it takes it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Necrotic damage, you say? It is. Oh, it already applied the...

But it still kills it. All right, who has the lowest hit points in your team right now?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I'll have to look, sorry. Maya has 64. Jim has 51.

Jesse has Jim. Jim has 51.

[Speaker 2]
So Jim is the... probably the one with the lowest hit points. Yep.

The Witchlight Ball floats over Jim.

[Speaker 1]
Jim is now unstoppable.

[Speaker 2]
Nice, okay, so that is the end of the combat there.

[Speaker 1]
Does Jim feel different?

[Speaker 2]
He feels like there is a lot of life around him.

[Speaker 1]
Maya will take her cloak off and approach the ghost. Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Nobody be pushing me.

[Speaker 1]
That is very fair, I am sorry to offend you.

[Speaker 2]
What bring you to my vessel?

[Speaker 1]
It appears to be in a peculiar location. How did you end up here in this beehive?

[Speaker 2]
That'd be a long story. I used to sail some astro-seas, and I fell in love with a... well, an alien who looked like a bee.

Oh! Our meeting was fate, for I found her in a barrel floating along the astro-seas. So it was told that I would forever love her, and so I stayed here when my ship crashed.

She was in stasis, and I swore I'd never leave her side.

[Speaker 1]
Is she perhaps the queen of this colony?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I never thought of it like that. I suppose there are a lot of bees around. Come to think of it, there's a lot of large honeycombs around here.

I've never really thought of it before. Ah, yeah. Have a good eye on you.

You're lovely in my business.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the life of a sailor is one for me. I would have loved to be in a crow's nest. Unfortunately...

It's not a pun. Not that I'm aware of.

[Speaker 2]
You'd love to be in my...

[Speaker 1]
Oh no. I'd love to hear you talking like that. It's very offensive.

I thank you. I'll keep that in mind. Fuck.

She said keep. Um, I will stay aware. Thank you.

I don't know what keep means in this context. Good, good. Well, if we see your wife, then I'll tell her where you are, and I'm sure she'd love to see you again.

Yeah, she knows I'm close by. We will go have a talk to her and see what's happening here then. There apparently is a witch about.

You heard? Do you know anything of the witch?

[Speaker 2]
All I know is that witches were always after me building a life. Peace or death. Tell you what though, I've always kept a special gun lying around should I encounter any kind of misbehaving wench.

Barmaiding. Spellcaster after me on balls. You look in the chest inside the back end here, just behind me.

I can't really open it. You find a compass. Tries to track weird magic.

You just have to focus on the weird magic. It'll let her know you're coming, but that's fine. You could meet up anyway.

[Speaker 1]
That would be very helpful, thank you. I will open the chest and get the compass. It's a one-time use, so use it well.

Thank you, I will.

[Speaker 2]
And then be sure to keep it on your ship's rack of souvenirs. For no privateer's sake.

[Speaker 1]
It will look very nice on... What's the aship called? It's not the Glade of Dreams, it's the uh...

Oh, the Midnight Dream.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, the Midnight. No, sorry, the Vessel of the Dreaming.

[Speaker 1]
The Dream of Dreaming.

[Speaker 2]
The Dream of Dreaming, yeah, also the Vessel of the Dreaming.

[Speaker 1]
It'll look very nice now, Vessel. The Dream of Dreaming.

[Speaker 2]
Corrin, that's a gay name. Very fitting for the Fairy Realms. It brings delight to the world.

Delight and happiness.

[Speaker 1]
Well, thank you, again.

[Speaker 2]
He meant gay in the sense of happy.

[Speaker 1]
Instinctively. Hey, I'm not gay, I'm not. The gun he mentioned, is that the...

When he said gun, did he mean gun, or is the compass the gun?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the compass is the compass. Sorry? I mentioned the gun to Bragg.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, okay. I have no idea where that is. That's a shame.

Well, the compass will be very handy. Don't let the witch get to it. I won't, thank you.

Maya will take the compass and like, open it up and focus on weird magic. So the direction basically functions like a one-time use locate creature spell, is what it actually does.

[Speaker 2]
This is like the... His embellishments were targeted on the witch, but really it's just a one-time use locate creature spell. And by naming the witch, you can sense that it is due west, and a little south.

A little south, like straight over, and then like, maybe like 10 degrees further south.

[Speaker 1]
Would that put us back in the hut? Or is it... It is a little bit north of the hut, actually.

Okay. We'll leave the captain ghost to his eternal punishment for being a pirate or whatever. I don't know, maybe he's a good pirate.

Maybe he just needs his wife. Either way, that can be resolved later. We can move toward...

I love my wife. We love a male wife, pirate boss. I guess we'll need some more stealth, but Maya didn't get hit this time, I don't think.

So we still have paths without choice. 10, 29... Wish there was a macro that I could roll all of these at once.

[Speaker 2]
Just everything that we need.

[Speaker 1]
Group stealth, go. I know every time it's mentioned, I need to see if Rana gets any better than that. She doesn't.

I mean, any worse. Rana gets C21, I still need Sierra and Jim. In Pathfinder you can just select all the tokens and then trigger.

It'll have like... Maybe it's a module I have. I have so many of this track.

Mm-hmm. One for Sierra and one at disadvantage for Mr. Jim. 24, the lowest is a 21.

I can put Jessie in the middle, Rana and Jim up the front. Maya and Sierra at the back. Seeing a door, Jim is inclined to open it.

Is that okay if I do so?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I can stop it. Okay, Jim stealthily opens a door.

[Speaker 1]
Rana will take a peek inside to see if there's anything about from the doorway. I'd like to see if there's any hiding creatures inside here. Yes, there is a 20 on perception for that.

Perception of 20.

[Speaker 2]
There are more bees inside this room at the edge. I want everybody in the UVC 15 to save him versus Hypnotic Pattern.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra can see... Are you gonna move him? Sierra can see the slight edge of this guy, so I think everyone is...

Is that wisdom save for Hypnotic Pattern?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think that Sierra can see. I'm doing it based on who this guy can see. Ah, okay.

But still, things are on the back wall there. I don't think it's gonna catch him.

[Speaker 1]
I think it'd at least get everyone else in. So, a wisdom save? Wisdom save, VC 15.

Do I need to do two or just the one? Just one.

[Speaker 2]
Just one group of bees.

[Speaker 1]
Jesse will add three minstrel dice to this one for him, bringing his to 20. I need Rana to do a wisdom save. God, her wisdom save's good.

She rolled 16, of course, after I say that. And just Mr. Jimothy left. And flash of genius that to a 14.

Jesse can add a minstrel dice to make that at least a 15. Jesse is down to one minstrel dice. That is all successes.

[Speaker 2]
Now, in the meantime, these guys did not see you, and none of you failed. As far as I'm concerned, you guys do have your surprise round.

[Speaker 1]
What is that? Can Rana try and identify a creature with the Akana religion?

[Speaker 2]
I think religion is easy.

[Speaker 1]
I believe you can use skull or dice to figure things out.

[Speaker 2]
That is correct.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that is literally what it says. To figure things out. She'll add two d8 to this one.

The 27. So this is a fear, is how it's pronounced.

[Speaker 2]
It is an aberration that feeds on dreams and nightmares. And it's usually in conflict with themselves. You are aware of them because they can also be found in various shadow realms, shadow lands, any kind of like upside down realm where wraiths and ghosts and other kind of undead people live, because they will also feed on those.

[Speaker 1]
That's pretty evil. Uh, yeah, kind of evil. Not the most evil thing I've ever seen, but uh, they deserve to die.

[Speaker 2]
The, your order, the Ashen Coil would be, uh, would hate these guys kind of on account of like, um, uh, it kind of kind of regards them as like desecrating corpses, if that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, true, then fuck these guys. Rana's going in. Surely she has something.

I'll do it for you, actually, James. Uh, are these guys immune to necrotic? Do I know if they're like resistant to necrotic damage?

[Speaker 2]
Let me check. That will be completely, especially given the information I just gave you, that would be completely appropriate for us. Nope, no, they are immune to being frightened, that is it.

[Speaker 1]
All righty, uh, Rana's going to run in and like, slam her hand, uh, the one on the left and cast her highest level spell harm. This has got to fire it up.

[Speaker 2]
The one on the right or the one on the left?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the one on the left, sorry, I think they- It's a T. Sorry. Perfect, whoops.

It takes 46 damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by 46. Okay, not that that really matters for people I'm going to slaughter. Okay, uh, rest of my turns.

Um, I love that the Operator's crossbow reloads itself, it's so good. Um, Maya's going to shoot, uh, five bolts at the one on the right, because, uh. She'll move up and do the one on the left, we should kill, we should focus fire.

Uh, she'll shoot five bolts, she has advantage for surprise. Um, Sneak Attack makes extra 66 damage as well as the extra bolts for 39 damage. She'll then Shadow Step and get advantage on the next attack.

Oh, the surprise, um, maybe they'll be hidden. Yeah, no, that's right, she'll Shadow Step, get advantage on the next attack. Shoot another five bolts.

This one does not have Sneak Attack. Oh, does it? 20 hit.

Point does hit, yeah. PC 60. I hope I haven't stumbled into something very scary.

Uh, another 25 damage on the left guy. Kills him. Excellent.

Jesse, Journey's Pistols, is going to cast... Gun. He's going to shoot the guy on the left twice with the beekeeper.

First attack, advantage, um, gets an extra damage for the single bee. Second attack, uh, two damage from two bees. That's, uh, 27 damage.

His bonus action, he's gonna, uh, uh, he'll like toss the beekeeper into the air and hammer the fan on the hornet's nest. And, um, uh, hit it all, uh, with all six bullets. Uh, so that's...

Minus 42? Yes. All righty.

That's his turn. We've got Jim. He can run in and give it the old uppercut.

Does his light affect this guy at all? No, no, it doesn't. Yep, okay, uh...

It's happening, uh... The old one too. Uh, one of them should have been surprised.

Okay, the first... One of them hit. That's good.

All right, we've just got Sierra left. Does moving into its view, uh, trigger the save for Sierra?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's only when the, when the effect explodes.

[Speaker 1]
We have a manifest blow claw attack. Uh, here's the attack roll. Full damage.

Second attack. What have I done? I've just rearranged my weapons.

[Speaker 2]
I think that will kill him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
Uh, bees are actually growing more agitated at the moment.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra will ask the bees, what's, what is, what's wrong?

[Speaker 2]
They start repeating over and over again. Finished, not finished, not finished.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra, bees say they're not... Something's not finished.

[Speaker 2]
Made her angry.

[Speaker 1]
What's the worst that could happen around this? I'm just glad those things are dead. Auto-gym has a new door to open.

Is this one locked at all?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, is this not the end of initiative? And what about the other characters? What are you not at?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they would have all had movement left, so they all could have got in here. Yep, yep, uh, we'll get in here and have my turn end. All right.

Oh, that was a surprise. Yeah, so now we have round one.

[Speaker 2]
And you're going to hear a woman, rather stupid voice, say, I'm going to do over. And bees should finish it and go ahead and have one of you guys roll.

[Speaker 1]
Let's go, Maya.

[Speaker 2]
Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 1]
How dare they make me waste my high level spell.

[Speaker 2]
This one is going to do... It wasn't a waste, because you didn't take any damage for the first one. It's going to release itself from invisibility now.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, what did it cost, Truesight, instead of harm? So that's not Maya. A hit.

Yep, that's all damage she takes now.

[Speaker 2]
So you're not restrained. And then he is going to use a frightful bite. He's going to squeeze in the air.

It's like this big gas bag that kind of floats up towards the ceiling. Very slightly bounces off.

[Speaker 1]
Does that trigger an attack of opportunity from Jim? Yes. Thunder Gauntlet, go!

And thunder damage.

[Speaker 2]
You'll have disadvantage on his attack, Truesight.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Thank god, that was a 15 otherwise on the dice. All right, that is its turn.

And we will have...

[Speaker 2]
This one will be a... Advantage to the attack versus... Jim.

[Speaker 1]
Yes! It got him! Jim, no!

I need to take magic adapt and get shield as well.

[Speaker 2]
Get shield. You're a perfect guide. That's psychic damage.

I don't know if he even takes psychic damage.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, he does.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, buddy.

[Speaker 1]
He is a thinking creature.

[Speaker 2]
What's the buff? And a frightful bite gives him his first attack.

[Speaker 1]
That is a miss. It is. I was not ready for this.

They're both towards the ceiling, but they're both still within five feet of runner, right? Sphere... word of radiance is a five foot sphere around runner.

Yeah. Yep, she'll do that then, targeting the two fuckers. Excellent.

Die by her hand. I robbed garbage damage though.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that sucks. All right, yep.

[Speaker 1]
Two ones and a four. She has a bonus action. She can cast...

I'm casting a lot of shield of faiths. You won't use a bonus action this turn. Runner's done now.

Jim's grappled, so I guess he's just gonna lay into the guy that's grappling him.

[Speaker 2]
He's not restrained, so he could do what he wants.

[Speaker 1]
He'll punch and he'll do it again. So I think that's one hit. Maya will do the same.

She'll use her... Um, she'll drop the crossbow and draw her kunai and give it the old stab. She is within...

it's within five feet of Jesse, so this one gets sneak attack. Second attack...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, so the original Thunderdome. I'll make sure I applied that.

[Speaker 1]
Um, second attack from Maya is a hit. Oh. 12 damage on this guy.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you rolled another hit instead of damage.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. 10 damage, my bad. Okay, now back to, uh, let's do Sierra.

She'll go for the one that has Jim. She'll do a manifest blow claw attack with a 26 to hit for full damage. Her second attack is a hit.

That time I nearly rolled the damage first. Uh, 21 to hit for seven damage. Third attack, she'll do one more claw attack with a bonus action.

Uh, a 25 to hit for six damage. Jesse is the last one left. He can not do much, honestly.

Uh, which, either of them look significantly more hurt.

[Speaker 2]
They're both at full health. The one on the right is slightly more damaged, I think.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, Jesse was just, um, he hasn't taken damage, so his hornet's nest isn't reloaded. He's just gonna shoot the beekeeper at this guy on the left twice with disadvantage because of close combat.

[Speaker 2]
Second one hits.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that should be one more damage. Sorry, I didn't add in the bee damage. Alrighty, that was a good round of attacks.

Not good enough, unfortunately. Uh, they went first, so yeah, we roll initiative again. Rana has rolled 11.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled a six. You guys go first.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's gonna be pretty similar to last round. Rana's gonna hit another word of radiance because it's really good damage output for uh, a cantrip.

[Speaker 2]
People who are 17th level are allowed to roll all cantrips, that's fine. At that point, it's basically a spell.

[Speaker 1]
Rana's level 12.

[Speaker 2]
That's right, she's not like super high. No, she seems super high level because she got that far back in the book.

[Speaker 1]
And the book gave her plus, um, four to her wisdom. Very good. Slightly better damage.

Yeah, and the clerics adding their wisdom modifier to damage just makes all cantrips good, especially once it hit two targets. Um, the bonus action she can not do much. Uh, Maya can continue stabbing the one next to her.

I forgot she has vampire bite. She's gonna bite the fucker. Uh, it's not a dex weapon, so it can't sneak attack.

Is this creature a construct or undead? Operation. Excellent.

I can empower my next attack roll or regain health equal to the piercing damage dealt. Let's regain health. Oh, beautiful.

My heal. And after biting it, she will then stab it. Uh, this is normal.

17 hits, I believe. Take, uh, sneak attack. 13.

Uh, and she's going to shadow step into a shadow over here. And I assume that breaks the grapple. Excellent.

Now, I've done Ryan, Hirona, I've done Maya, Mr. Jim can keep laying into his guy. That's the lightning launcher. That's an attack.

Uh, a 20 and a 22. First one will probably do it. I'm okay with him wasting an attack.

We can have Sierra move across. Manifest Blue Chlorotech, first one. 19 to hit.

Here's one I haven't done in a hot second. Stunning Strike. Excellent.

Let's head down to 5k. Uh, the damage from the first attack is maxed to 19. Second attack has advantage.

Excellent. Excellent. All right, does that break initiative?

That does break initiative. You are now further, it's like you're further north than your target.

[Speaker 2]
Sort of like directly south.

[Speaker 1]
Oh boy, um, how's everyone doing? Maya could take a Cure Wounds from Rana. 17 healing.

Very efficient for a first level spell. I wish I was a life cleric. Terra's very strong with healing.

I get to roll more dice though. Um, okay. Back to the plan.

Jim, get ungrappled. Open the damn door.

[Speaker 2]
So in this room, there's one, there's a special honey. That can significantly increase a creature of humanoid shape. Roughly insectoid body.

Only it's very, it's very anthro. Like has a, kind of like you stuck a borax and a stinger onto it. You could see if like, for instance, whether the joints are in a human, for instance, there are like segments.

So the arm looks mostly human, except it has like a, like hinge where the elbow is. Yeah, I see. It's noticeably colder in here than the rest of the area.

It's a pool, small, like there's an obelisk with six small pools of water to it. They are all just barely over, um, just barely not overflowing. Pooling at the top of the obelisk with a tub next to it.

[Speaker 1]
Jim is, uh, curious of the encased creature. Um, Rana would like to try and discern what sort of ritual, uh, or magical effect is being, uh, done here by the pool and the chalice in the obelisk. Sure, she is figuring something out.

So she will add two scholar dice to the roll. I rolled a natural one for 21. Sure.

[Speaker 2]
This is a weather control, only present if it follows. Very rarely you have, it is like, this is the only other place that there's a pin vehicle. I see.

Basically what you have to do is you have to, you have to pick a pool to add water to, as we pause, spill over, next to, essentially that you are taking, um, you are taking, I got ahead of myself, that's why I was confused. So you fill up one pool, it will overflow into the tub next to it, and you chew and wipe. It's the temperature of the weather to be more pleasant, less pleasant, etc.

And then the other pools, as they overflow, they take the local area in the opposite of it, or in the opposite direction.

[Speaker 3]
All right, okay.

[Speaker 2]
So there's temperature, pleasant, and unpleasant. The temperature getting hotter or colder, the getting more pleasant or unpleasant. And, um, and then finally there's just not precipitation, there's like, which is weird.

I think we'll know. I see. Which is also the weather giving.

[Speaker 1]
I don't really want to disturb the weird encased person, bee person, insect guy. Unless Rana can like, figure out, I don't know, that's weird. I think, I don't think she wants to figure out.

I think Jim's gonna open the next door.

[Speaker 2]
Is that all we've got?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I think we're still in combat, which is...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you guys are, uh, you guys are now getting further away from the...

[Speaker 1]
I need to quickly check this one, and then we'll keep adding Jim, or Judy, if there's another fucking pool.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not in a rush, I'm totally fine too. You guys are fine, I want to let you know. I want to keep you pretty safe where the compass is pointed.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Monster only.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, hello.

[Speaker 1]
The more doors I open, fighting monsters, the more XP I get. I think I saw once that Ballad XP gives player XP to all characters present. Is that going to apply here?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... It looks, uh, I think about that.

[Speaker 3]
You're not going to get all of my characters?

[Speaker 2]
You're already getting all of the, uh... You're already getting a player share of XP for crossing characters.

[Speaker 1]
Well yeah, then my players each get, like, 100k XP each.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, there are a... These. What are these?

There is a... There's a Frost Sylvan, Dryad, a Primorium, a... Oops, there we go.

And a Pixie are playing cards. They're currently using little shot glasses filled with honey as chips.

[Speaker 1]
How do they react to an autonome opening the door?

[Speaker 2]
Now the Primorium has a cigar, which is not like a true Bako cigar. It's like an incense, kind of. It's like a...

It's like a burning incense stick that... It really is like a ghoul log for fucking incense that's in his thing. And it's like, it doesn't quite fall out, but it just kind of like rolls around in his mouth.

You'll notice at this point that they're in various states of undress.

[Speaker 1]
My apologies. Jim's gonna shut the door. No.

Jim's... No. That way is blocked.

[Speaker 2]
They're playing strip poker.

[Speaker 1]
Jim had a thought of being stripped down for parts if he participated, and it scared him. There was a door on the other side of them that I want to get to, and I don't really want to kill them all while they're playing strip poker. Let's head towards our destination.

I'm gonna harass them after we kill the witch. We have... Here, southeast.

Um, I'm just gonna... I can't move through the walls. I miss being a game master.

Let's see. I've got Jim... There we go, got him through.

Um, I will head across.

[Speaker 2]
They're a little bit more east than they are south.

[Speaker 1]
What marching order do I want? Monks at the back. I'll move my group 30 feet.

Collide with a wall. Excellent. We get for being lazy.

A little bit further. All righty, he's moving to here again.

[Speaker 2]
More southeast. Uh, nothing in this room in particular. Well, actually...

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Uh, and the doors to the north are similar to every other door I've encountered so far. All right.

Stand back, Jesse. Stand back, Maya. The door opener approaches the door.

[Speaker 2]
There's a unit of sprites. Have a, uh, they have a small barricade of honeycomb set up. They are letting those across.

Those and coffee muskets, if you want to play with.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
And when you enter, they say, Halt! Whoops there. Not the right caps, are you?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Maya steps forward. No, we are here on, uh, business of the Sunflower King. We're here to check working conditions of all members or all people currently residing in the Sunflower Forest.

[Speaker 2]
But we used to be a lot better.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, please elaborate. What's, what's got you bogged down?

[Speaker 2]
Which one? A monk? And she's absolutely...

[Speaker 1]
Then it appears that we should deal with this witch as, uh, as we are sent by the Sunflower King. I assume the witch is nearby?

[Speaker 2]
She lands. She lands nearby. Every time we try to follow her, she puts us to sleep.

Depends if she wants to cast us. Can't see.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any other information about the witch you can tell us?

[Speaker 2]
She's more dangerous. She's more dangerous when you can't see her. And she's got the...

The reason we were following her is because we know that she could cast a death curse. And she is a, she's a bargain. Bargain with something being disabled.

She's probably a hack. If she dies, then a curse gets cast on whoever did it. Hmm.

Casts a curse, tricks up her sleeve. The thing that's really dangerous about her is the people that she's with.

[Speaker 1]
Very well. Thank you for your information. We will speak with the witch on behalf of the Sunflower King.

[Speaker 2]
Very good. We'll stay here.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, excellent. Shut the door. We can send supreme door opener to the last north door.

[Speaker 2]
Shots fired! And a single acorn falls to the ground. Immediately muskets.

[Speaker 1]
Jim opens the door.

[Speaker 2]
Do you see a bunch of bugs for the sprites in the aforementioned room?

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. I will leave them undisturbed. Do not wish to loot.

From idiots. All righty. Am I getting a good sense of the compass pointing?

All righty. People will be readying weapons. Order Jim will approach the door.

Maybe he shouldn't. Jesse and Maya at the back. Sierra off to the side.

All right. Jim's going to open the door. Wait.

Uh, Rana's going to heal him with a first level. What? First.

Uh, 1d8. Jim is a little bit hurt. Play healing.

There we go. Back to good. I'm impressed.

I haven't had to take a short rest this entire dungeon. All right. I'm going to open the door.

I see nothing. Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
Also, I have to disappear. Okay, so when Jim stands or opens the door up. Yeah, when Jim approaches the door, there's a little bit of foliage underneath it.

Which is not atypical. There's foliage everywhere. Steps on it.

And you notice that there are the people behind you and notice that it immediately tracks underneath the door. Additionally, the door behind Sierra at this point opens. Begins creaking.

See if it actually opens on their turn. 1d8.

[Speaker 1]
My heads are all denied. Incredible. The assassin mine.

[Speaker 2]
This is what. Oh, hey. Heal to everyone.

Oh. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Um, am I aware of the vines behind the door? Jim's going to step forward. Would Rana be able to fit in this square?

Is that a bit too small next to Jim? Let's do it. It's a bonus action around a razor shield and she'll step in and cast a word of radiance.

Hitting both of them. Damn. Well, no damage.

I don't have to roll. And auto-Jim will punch them both. With thunder damage.

I was about to say, I was like, oh, is this the one time it's going to come into play? Not using the lightning launcher, unfortunately. Uh, one on the left first.

Um, double damage and the one on the right second. A19 to hit. Uh, the, they now have disadvantage if they don't attack Jim.

[Speaker 2]
You hit each of them once, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, each of them. So the left was first and the right one was second. Okay, that brings us to.

Ah, I can shoot. Uh, she'll shoot the one on the right. She has a better view of it at the operator crossbow with five bolts.

Uh, she can shadow step before the attack on the spot pretty much to get advantage. 17 hit.

[Speaker 2]
Here it goes.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, she ally, so it's an extra 66 damage. 27 damage on the first attack. Uh, second attack being a flat roll, better.

Another five bolts for 23 damage. Jesse will, uh, shoot at the same one on the, uh, right beekeeper. First attack is a miss.

Second attack is a crit. Uh, you take one extra bee and critical damage. 14 offhand attack.

We'll take one shot at it with the hornet's nest. Same one. There we go, very good.

Uh, Sierra can't really get in there, so she will wait a bit closer. Done.

[Speaker 2]
That sounds good. Uh, I can't believe I have to go first. They have been, uh, distanced.

I feel for Jim.

[Speaker 1]
Come on, Jim.

[Speaker 2]
Missy. That's Missy. That's the one.

Miss. And miss again. All right, there's three.

Scrabble again, whatever. And we'll need to brush our weapon. And we're gonna have some constricting attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. I think Jesse's just out of... No, Jesse's in range.

There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Really, I should have done this before. That's okay. Sierra, upgrade strength saves.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra and upgrade, uh, Jim are restrained.

[Speaker 2]
Dude, I don't know about that. So this one's gonna go for Sierra. The one that's gonna go for Maya.

[Speaker 1]
You do the car special and just make all of this difficult terrain.

[Speaker 2]
That should tie good. They're chilling. I missed, of course, the non-advanced one.

[Speaker 1]
So, eight now. Twenty-two later.

[Speaker 2]
Why did I have to do this?

[Speaker 1]
I pressed a rule. I don't think Maya can break out of that because these ones are full. So I'm just going to apply all the damage now.

No, I should see if I go first and then apply the damage. Okay, um, let's go, Jesse. I do go first, so I can apply the damage.

All right, so Maya's grabbed and restrained. Sierra's restrained by the terrain. Jim's restrained by the terrain.

We can do the easy ones first. We can do Rana a Word of Radiance again for 20 damage. And she will cast, use a second level spell to cast Shield of Faith on auto-Jim, bringing his AC to 26.

Auto-Jim can then follow up with, um, whoops, I've just shut the door trying to click on auto-Jim. He can try and punch them each again, but I think he has disadvantage because he's restrained. So the one on the left first with a nine to hit.

We'll just try it again. It's another nine. Jesus, unlucky Jim.

He'll use a bonus action to He gets, uh, he gets temporary hit points to, uh, equal to levels in his class. That should be, yes, he gets eight temp hit points. Okay, that's those two done.

Sierra is restrained. She could, she'll use her action to try and break through, break, she'll use her bonus action to rage before she does that. However, um, is it a strength check?

[Speaker 2]
DC 13 athletics check, which you, you have advantage on those.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, I believe that enough. She'll, um, break out and, uh, go stand in front of these guys.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I think you accidentally re-flied it.

[Speaker 1]
There we are. Um, can these guys reach her if she leaves?

[Speaker 2]
Those guys cannot.

[Speaker 1]
So you're right in the front. Uh, she is raging. We still have Maya and Jessie.

Jessie is restrained. No, Maya is restrained. Jessie is not.

Uh, if Awaken was a single action, that'd be very funny. So he'll keep shooting the most hurt shambling mound, I think. He'll buy the beekeeper twice, putting it to two bolts left in the chamber.

Um, no benefits. Two hits, um. He'll do, oh, over 15 hits.

Damage roll, it now has two bees. Um, the first one, and on the second one it now has three bees. So that is, uh, 30.

Uh, he'll, um, he'll whip out, uh, Hornet's Nest and do one more. 24, kills it easy. Maya will shadow step and use her action to use the Cloak of Invisibility.

Uh, no, she'll do that around the other way. She'll use the cloak first, and then shadow step. Breaking the, uh, grapple and restrain, I guess.

Shadow step to like, uh, invisibly. There we are. That is my turn.

Nice, we just had... I went first this time, yep, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Sneak around. Comes in the upper screen. Upper screen.

Correct.

[Speaker 1]
That is 11 damage, she needs to make a con check of. And she is still concentrating on Shield of Faith. Take 11, bring her to 82.

[Speaker 2]
Scambling now, having to install a bottle gun. I'm gonna go for the more appealing guy.

[Speaker 1]
Still concentrating.

[Speaker 2]
It's written. Let's see guys, who's here? Miss.

Miss. Check on awesomenesses. All right, and this two, is that next round?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, I have rolled a 20. Very good. I will finish that.

Um, Rana's currently grabbed by an assassin vine. I would have to kill it before she acts. Rana will act last out of the group, and I'm gonna try and kill it before it gets her.

Ready? Maya will act first, she will shoot her operator's crossbow at it. Uh, do these guys have like, tremor sense or anything?

Is she hidden from it?

[Speaker 2]
You are not hidden.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, a normal attack roll, but it has sneak attack. Does a 14 hit?

[Speaker 2]
That's it, they have AC 13. They have blind sight.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, running low on bolts, but. I can keep sending him this attack. 30 damage for first attack.

All right, still got that. One more and we'll send the last, um, not the last, but the, just send five more bolts and that'll put it very close to empty. Uh, whoops, I had advantage.

What was the first one there? 10, so that's a 21 to hit.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um, damage, it's an extra 46 this time. 25 damage.

[Speaker 2]
It is dead, and finally, another grapple to illustrate.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra's gonna go for this vine assassin next to her, which will do her um, manifest blow attack first with the, no, even worse, that's a miss. Rolled advantage again accidentally.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that hits, it's a, well, which one?

[Speaker 1]
Um, it would have been a two. The first roll there's a two, so that's a, um, 11 to hit. Yeah, that would.

Um, she can do her manifest blow because the first one didn't hit. Uh, that is a hit. It's full damage of 19.

Uh, with her bonus action, she can do one more claw attack. 18 to hit. Or 11 damage.

Which of the, um, vine blights cost a D? Does that go away when they die, or? That's a good question.

[Speaker 2]
It probably does. If it died, and it goes away. So Jim is more constrained.

Right.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yes. All right, Jesse's going to target the, um, the, uh, shambling man on the left. The beekeeper, a miss, and a hit.

This is bee number four. Uh, so that's 20 damage. All right, yes, yes, it's got plus 11.

Nice. Okay, uh, now the beekeeper is empty. The hornet's nest is not, however, so he's going to fire that at it.

Or 11 more damage at the shambling man. We now have auto-jip, who is going to punch the shambling man. Um, normal attacks the same.

18 to hit for six damage. One more. The, no, that was a second damage roll.

A miss clicked. Fine, miss. Easy.

Now, Rana's turn. She's no longer grappled. She can cast her cantrip again.

12 damage to the shambling man. She'll step behind Jim. They have reach.

Wait, I don't know if these guys have reach, actually. She'll step back and see if it triggers an attack.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, go for it. It has a disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
That is a miss. Okay, that's my gang done.

[Speaker 4]
That's my gang.

[Speaker 1]
I won that, yes. Here you go.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, hello, good to see you. Thank you. That first two make it again.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Whoops, I shut the door. Um, Jim will go first.

Rana's fine this time, again. I'm just going back. Rana's level 12.

What feet? Keen, mate. Good feet.

Let's be good shit. All right, we're good. Hot dog.

Um, Rana will negate that one. She is running low on those. I think I have two left.

[Speaker 2]
It's hilarious that I'm actually getting somebody to, like, drop all of them in a session. Step up the rocks. All right, 13.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops.

[Speaker 2]
That one misses. That's all, uh, okay. As this shambly mound gets more and more degraded, you can see that there's a staff center.

[Speaker 1]
Huh. Um. There might be another, um, assassin vine attack there against.

I only see one construct.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, they used the entangled.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, entangled. Yep, my bad. Uh, I guess we roll again for initiative.

I have rolled another 20. Um. The shambling mounds don't have reach, do they?

Rana is not in range of anyone. She will cast. Maybe it's within five feet.

Maybe it's not even up. She's going to cast guiding bolt at the shambling mount. With a third level.

24 to hit. Extra d6 on top. 23 radiant damage.

Jim is going to follow that up with some hits. First one gets advantage.

[Speaker 2]
I remember he was still or something.

[Speaker 1]
Is he still? Oh, the first one's a flat roll. Uh, 26.

That's a hit. We reapply the, um, a 13's a miss. Jesse is going to shoot at the, uh, assassin vine next to Sierra.

No, he's going to spend his action reloading the beekeeper. He hasn't taken damage. Um.

Bonus action, he can shoot the hornet's nest at the one next to Sierra. 22 to hit. Or 12 damage.

[Speaker 2]
What was it?

[Speaker 1]
Um, Sierra can step forward and attack the next blight. I mean, the next assassin. Uh, the first is a manifest blow.

It's a normal attack roll. 12 misses, I think. Second attack is a hit.

19 damage. Whoops. Third attack is another claw attack.

Through a miss. I can move to here and shoot at this, uh, assassin once. Uh, with, sorry, with one bolt.

He can shadow step there to get advantage on it. 16, does that hit? Uh, we have an extra 2d6 for sneak attack.

21 damage. Alrighty, that is everyone on my team done. We have a shambling mound to go.

[Speaker 2]
The last thing he gets to do here. Let's see if he gets to do his move. And, oh, I guess we get to, to be.

[Speaker 1]
Jim hasn't, he's the only one that hasn't rolled yet. Tied.

[Speaker 2]
All right, you guys kill him.

[Speaker 1]
Jim beats him to death. Would you like me to roll anything, or? No, no, you're good.

Very good.

[Speaker 2]
All right, and there's a, what's that with a serpent's head on?

[Speaker 1]
Um, does it appear magical? Probably magical. Um, I'm just going to stick her head back in this, uh, pixie room.

Uh, do you mind if we take a short rest in here?

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Shut the door. Uh, my guys are going to go into their barracks and, um, try and take a short rest if that's. Um, I will grab the staff out of the mound.

Jesse is going to ritual cast identify on that one while the rest, um, while Rana and Maya take a short rest and auto Jim and Sierra will keep watch.

[Speaker 2]
It is a staff of the constrictor.

[Speaker 1]
What does it do? Is that a?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, it's a regular 5b item. Let's see, um, basically it turns into a snake.

[Speaker 4]
Neat.

[Speaker 1]
I will add that to Jesse's sheet. Staff of the constrictor. Is that it?

See if plutonium finds it. I am not able to find it. I'll add it to my sheet and remember what it does.

[Speaker 2]
It's staff of the serpent.

[Speaker 3]
Um, I, yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, um, and so the, how does the rest go? Uh, the, uh, before the rest happens, Rana uses, um, honest divine power to gain, uh, two, can be used, higher than half your proficiency bonus. So she can get two, uh, second level spells back.

She can use the pearl of power to get a third back as well. Okay. And then, uh, the two of them take a rest.

Are they able to do that? Is there any encounter? Okay.

Um.

[Speaker 2]
It's an auto Jim and standard watch.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Auto Jim and Sierra are keeping guard of the entrances. Uh, okay.

Hit dice, short rest. And three hit dice for Rana. And five for Maya.

Has the, um, compass position changed at all?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yes, it changes very slightly. Not bad Jim. You hear something.

[Speaker 1]
You see, well, after the rest, my party will gather themselves up and head towards where the shambling mounds were. Maya gets her key back.

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra. Uh, um, yeah, they're going to head down towards the room. If nothing's, uh, changed, Rana will be keeping an eye out for, uh, that sort of thing.

If anyone's hiding.

[Speaker 2]
So basically, once you go into these next rooms here, you'll find cave entrance into the first cave entrance. You know, so let's follow, and the witch has set up a shop there. There's a, um, an open door, an open secret door.

A note attached to it that says, uh, I know when to, when to quit while I'm ahead. Thanks for not ruthlessly hunting me down. It would have ended poorly for all of us.

Take the staff as a small token of appreciation.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, by the staff, they mean the Python staff, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Yes. Take me out to dinner if you're ever in Rana.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be something Sierra to do. All right. Very well.

Um, I guess we'll go back and, uh, talk to the gnomes and see how they're doing.

[Speaker 2]
Um, tell the gnomes I'm not sorry for turning them into redcaps, but it should probably fade.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, we'll go back and talk to the gnomes and wait until they snap out of their trance or whatever they're in.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, they're, they're not, they're not redcaps right now, I was timing things such like dusk that they were gonna, then they were gonna.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, so it would have actually been fucked if I took like three little short rests.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, there were, there were certain guys in this dungeon, which was a lot of fun.

[Speaker 1]
That's great. Um, well, I still haven't found the queen.

[Speaker 2]
Your sentient weapon replies, yes you did.

[Speaker 1]
I think. Well, I'm gonna ask the weapon, was it the thing in the weather room?

[Speaker 2]
Correct.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Affirmative.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I, um, how heavy is, is the queen stuck in place? Is it like fixed to the honey, like is the honeycomb movable that it's in?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, one second.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, is that, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, just calculating XP. So the XP for this is going to be 1,500 and...

[Speaker 1]
Um, that gets Jim leveled up. Not to get anyone else leveled up. Um, yeah, I'd like to try and bring the queen's stasis honeycomb to the pirate.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can. Once you remove it from the, that little tree there, and the band's warming up, the thing goes, yarr, my wife is...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, do you think you could do us a favor in exchange for seeing your wife? I was hoping to move this, uh, beehive area. I think there's a better location for it, uh, a hex over, if you'd be willing to ask your wife to move.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's about 2am here, so I'm getting ready to head on.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. I think that's everything, I think that's everything wrapped up.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah. The reward from the, the reward from this favor.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Awesome. I had a great time today.

[Speaker 2]
I enjoyed it.

[Speaker 1]
You powered it.

[Speaker 2]
Fucked down the staff.

[Speaker 1]
I, yeah, I powered through it. I wouldn't want to do this every time I play, but every now and then this is good. Not having to put up with people looking through their character sheet, like, oh, what does this do?

What does this do?

[Speaker 2]
I liked it. Because the witch wasn't going to put up a, basically was not going to put up a fight, like, the cool things that she could do was, like, casting spells through animals and fucking with the encounters that were in the area. If you meet her, she's a lady.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's very much like reaching Ethel at the bottom of her house in Act 1 of Baldur's Gate, where she'll just bargain her way out if she can.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, she's like, I don't really, right?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I assume you've put the XP in the, uh, yep. Awesome. Well, I'll write up a report of how this went.

And, uh, yeah, thank you again for running. That was great.

[Speaker 2]
Always. All right, man. So, fantastic evening, and I can't wait to play with you again.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. Alrighty, dude. I'll catch you later.

[Speaker 6]
...avoid too many of these? I should probably tell her. I don't think she realizes that I wanted to avoid some spoilers.

[Speaker 5]
I wish they would have had Upper City.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I also wish there was a different way to get, um, the drow lady. Is there not? Just knock her the fuck out.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, yes. The answer for everything.

[Speaker 5]
No, you could just knock her out.

[Speaker 2]
Just knock, just knock her out. Back to your cave!

[Speaker 5]
Yeah! Caveman style.

[Speaker 6]
Oh god, I got jumpscared by James.

[Speaker 1]
I'll just walk over. If there's a train track nearby, I'll just, uh, throw myself onto those. That's a great start to my day.

That's wild. I can only hear that from one of my ears right now, because I accidentally covered the other one and infected it with wax.

[Speaker 5]
I... ...am having difficulty hearing things. I do wish they had better difficulty scaling in Baldur's Gate.

[Speaker 6]
It seemed like it was pretty- well, I play on easy, turbo easy, and, uh, fucking god mode, so I guess I really can't say much, but it seemed like they had a lot of options, at least, for difficulty.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, well, I was playing- like, I think they added some more in later patches, and I haven't played on those. Or on a mode beside it later. Honor mode is go-to.

I was playing the hardest difficulty, and it was like, if you know the system and do any amount of, like, gear min-maxing, uh, it's, it's like, pretty trivial.

[Speaker 3]
I have a hard time with honor mode, because if any of the companions die, I break the fuck down. I can't. I just start over.

They're not allowed to die.

[Speaker 5]
Understandable. I feel like- I feel that way about everyone except Gale.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck Gale. Well, nobody has really mentioned, uh- Nobody's really thinking about Gale when they express concern or attachment for- For Gale.

[Speaker 6]
I always feel bad, because, like, he's, I think, the only companion you can straight up just miss. Like, everyone else kind of gets shoved at you pretty easily, whereas Gale, you could just, like, walk by him and not know anything- like, not even see him.

[Speaker 5]
Because I didn't know what those, like, things were at first, and I thought that thing was gonna explode, and I was gonna walk by.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna stay away from this one.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I think I had one of the bugs in the earlier patches, where, like, it's- he, like, immediately starts trying to fuck you. And, like, you want him to know you're an answer? I was like, no, this is not happening.

What is this? You're getting sex- No sex for you!

[Speaker 1]
There's a tingle in your step, it's like, what are you doing, bro?

[Speaker 3]
He's got those fucking puppy dog eyes, ugh, god. No, the person that I hate rejecting the most is Will, because he just backs away with sad eyes. And it just makes me sad.

[Speaker 5]
Rejecting Will is kinda like- It hurts my soul. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Does he look very pitiful when you do it?

[Speaker 2]
He looks so pitiful.

[Speaker 7]
I see.

[Speaker 2]
He turns into a kicked puppy. He does! Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, I just stick with Astarian.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, Astarian's pretty badass.

[Speaker 6]
I'm playing as Astarian in my most recent one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 6]
Because I wanted to romance Will.

[Speaker 3]
You couldn't do that in Astarian, was there?

[Speaker 6]
No, so I really want to see it because I saw one of Astarian's lines where he says that, like, when he was a child, Will was totally his type.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he said that when he was like 14.

[Speaker 6]
And I think that's adorable, so I'm going to force these together.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I mean, think about it. He wants to secure his safety in the party. What better to do that than to buddy up to the one person who is most likely to kill him, the monster hunter.

[Speaker 5]
Will's patron is an interesting character, too.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah. Fuck her. But she's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
When you say interesting, what do you mean?

[Speaker 5]
I like that they even put her in the game. You can, like, interact with her. I think you can try to, like, seduce her?

Although it's, like, not clear who's manipulating who.

[Speaker 4]
No, she tries to seduce you.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
It's a great...

[Speaker 5]
It's even funnier if you're romancing Will.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. No, that's not fun.

[Speaker 1]
No, but...

[Speaker 3]
He's like, how fucking could you? What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
He's like, what are you doing?

[Speaker 3]
Starian's over here like, what the fuck? You didn't invite me? Like, what is this?

[Speaker 1]
The funnier the romance gets, the better it is. That's the key. Yeah, Shadowheart taught you to climb Mount Halsandus.

[Speaker 5]
Wild. Halsand, I feel like, was drastically underwritten.

[Speaker 3]
So, a lot got cut out. Originally, I think he was the one that killed Isabelle?

[Speaker 8]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
And started the whole thing. Started the whole Shadow Curse, so he, like, fucking hates himself. They cut out so much of his backstory.

They cut out so much of it, and I don't understand why.

[Speaker 4]
Pressure to meet the deadline. Which is fucked up. If they had made everything in the game, every act, as detailed as Act 1, it would have taken them another four years to put out the game.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I know that they said in Act 2, Moonrise Towers was supposed to be, like, two different towers. And so they cut it down a lot. I'm glad.

Yeah, I'm kind of glad, because Act 3 is so overwhelming with the entire, every, you can go into almost every single building. Yeah, Act 3 was probably my least favorite.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like Halsand was last, wasn't he? And he replaced one of the other Romanceables that was going to be in there. Which I'm mad about, because it was supposed to be, like, a halfling, if I remember correctly.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
Being replaced with a giant fucking elf. It would have been... I love Halsand.

He's definitely one of my favorites.

[Speaker 5]
I think in every game, I would probably want to skip all of the stuff in Act 3 outside of the city. All the, like, refugee stuff. All of that is so boring.

[Speaker 1]
I did skip it. I went back to it later to do, like, the clown shit. But besides that, I was just like, okay.

[Speaker 5]
The clown stuff is fun, the circus stuff is fun, there's, like, a murder mystery thing that's fun.

[Speaker 1]
The problem I have with Act 3 is, firstly, it's supposed to be relieving, because you just got out of the Shadowcurse lands. Yeah, you're like, man, it's good to be back in civilization. And then you're just bombarded with a bunch of exposition and this massive fucking city.

And you're like, what the fuck do I do? Because everyone wants me to help them with something.

[Speaker 4]
Everybody wants me. Is the server up? It's Act 1.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it should be up now.

[Speaker 3]
Critical failure.

[Speaker 4]
I'm still getting administrator access.

[Speaker 3]
Still getting critical failure.

[Speaker 1]
Try this again, because every time I have to migrate the package... This is one of the problems I had to deal with earlier. Every time I have to migrate the server back to a different version, it causes these kinds of problems.

[Speaker 6]
Did something happen? I am getting in just fine.

[Speaker 1]
No, no. So I had to... What was it?

I had to play... I was playing Lancer last night. I ran a Lancer session.

Which is great fun, of course, but also meant that I had to run it in an earlier version of Foundry. Because right as Foundry... Right as Lancer got a Foundry 11 version, there was a...

Foundry came out with version 12. Which was very, very annoying. So that means I have to yet again start switching server versions and stuff like that if I want to...

If I want to play Lancer. A little annoying, but... How was the Lancer session, by the way?

Because I saw that go on for a while. It was actually a lot of fun. It was a little bit scuffed in the beginning.

I did boot two players, which did not even play. I didn't include them in the initial test game for that reason. Because I suspected they would cause these kinds of problems.

But it was actually a lot of fun. I enjoyed myself. Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 7]
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

[Speaker 3]
What the fuck happened last game?

[Speaker 1]
Who has 19 hit points?

[Speaker 2]
Charis.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Charis?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
We fought the demons. The space demons. We fought the space demons.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, right.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Space tentacle-y... I don't remember.

Space demon.

[Speaker 6]
We also fought one of those in the other game, too.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
But he did not have armor.

[Speaker 3]
I'm so tired of demons. Not really. Keep throwing them at us.

They're cool.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, keep throwing demons at us. I thought you did just fine. But it was hilarious.

Now the session that I've been hyped for. It's time to kill the fucking Baelor. Or die trying.

[Speaker 3]
Or get killed. Should have bought healing potions.

[Speaker 4]
What happens if we die out here?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. What happens to our souls?

[Speaker 1]
If you die out here? That's a good question. Oh dear.

You wanna find out?

[Speaker 2]
Not really. Well... We do have Pera here.

[Speaker 1]
They have Pera. So it's like, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I said Pera. We're doing space, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're in space.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so we have Pera. So if you die, she'll just bring you back. It's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I mean, don't worry too much, obviously.

[Speaker 3]
The protocol for death? I haven't seen it yet. Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
Do you guys wanna figure one out? Briefly?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. Just... Don't let the healer go down.

That's the best.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

[Speaker 3]
Because they depend on them.

[Speaker 1]
I have a plan. I'm gonna tank. And punch things.

[Speaker 7]
Fantastic idea.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna try and kill this thing before it kills us.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, don't use your...

[Speaker 8]
That's a great idea.

[Speaker 3]
Don't use the Divine Intervention until we are in dire need of escape. Or it's like... It's a last call.

Like a last-ditch-effort thing.

[Speaker 5]
Last line of defense.

[Speaker 2]
Does Pera have her teleport back?

[Speaker 6]
Um... Oh god, it's been so long. And I have not been keeping...

It happens once a week. I feel like... I don't think we've used it?

[Speaker 1]
Teleport does not go across planes. It takes you to a different spot on the same plane.

[Speaker 2]
No, that's fine. I'm just thinking like... If we're all about to die, we can teleport away so that we don't die.

[Speaker 6]
What teleportation circles do you know on this plane of existence?

[Speaker 2]
The one by the shrine, right?

[Speaker 6]
Teleport doesn't have to go to a circle, does it?

[Speaker 7]
No, that's just teleport. Oh no, you're right, it's just teleport. But like, one of their locations.

[Speaker 1]
I guess you could try to teleport to one. The shrine's not on this plane of existence. That's a different one.

[Speaker 6]
The ship.

[Speaker 5]
There's a chance, at least. So you're telling me there's a chance. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
The point is not directly next to this guy.

[Speaker 6]
Did I ever buy an expensive fork? I need to go buy an expensive fork.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I do have I do have planeshift without the expensive fork so that could help.

[Speaker 6]
I don't have planeshift in my preparations yet. So tragically I would not be able to planeshift. But if you can planeshift, we still need a fork.

[Speaker 7]
The cool staff thing makes it so I don't have to. Alright. But we could teleport to the moon.

We did collect rocks from that.

[Speaker 2]
We're going to the moon!

[Speaker 1]
Also, technically it's a separate plane of existence. But getting closer to existence.

[Speaker 7]
So not the moon. But fortunately not the moon. Oh.

C'est la vie.

[Speaker 6]
How does that even work with like ships?

[Speaker 1]
I'm assuming you say teleport. You're referring to teleport, right?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Like even in just a regular game if there's a ship and it's traveling around it's kind of a location but it moves.

[Speaker 1]
Right. I'm going to make that I would, I think decide that that made it slightly less familiar. I think it would be reasonable to deign it less familiar on account of like all the ways in which you could all the ways in which a ship could be less familiar to you.

You know?

[Speaker 7]
That's fair. Probably should have stolen like, I don't know, a plank from it. That's fine.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, even then it's like you go to maybe where you took the plank. Yeah, no no no. So there would be a chance there would be a chance of a mishap.

You could however make it to the vessel itself. Alright, so for this I would like you guys actually to make me, so I don't have to like resolve in simulationist terms you guys getting to the ship. I would love a skill check involving you guys get to the ship and evading you know evading ship-based artillery.

Evading pacemake fire.

[Speaker 3]
Is it Is there a one person rule?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I was asking if it's one person makes the rule or if everyone does.

[Speaker 1]
With skill checks you guys different people make the checks. A skill challenge is where you guys make a bunch of checks in an attempt to progress yourselves through a scene and get incremental progress for each successful check.

[Speaker 7]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, what are we rolling?

[Speaker 1]
Well, to start off I would love somebody to attempt to pilot I think we all know who's gonna pilot this bad boy.

[Speaker 6]
We're not letting him.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody else take the wheel.

[Speaker 2]
He does have land vehicle I don't know if that's applicable here.

[Speaker 1]
No, I don't think so.

[Speaker 6]
I don't think corpuses was space vehicles either though.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, no, I just rolled really fucking poorly, okay? I have like a plus seven. It might be a plus eight.

You just rolled really poorly.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but you always roll really poorly. It's like me trying to roll a stealth check.

[Speaker 1]
Doing it on purpose.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not doing it on purpose.

[Speaker 1]
Put your faith in the monk.

[Speaker 4]
No. How would a sleight of hand check be for piloting? Applicable or not applicable?

[Speaker 1]
Generally it's going to be if you don't have proficiency, it's going to be just the modifier. Or your ability score modifier. If you do have proficiency, it would be something like either based on your strength, based on your dexterity, or sorry, based on your strength, your wisdom, or your intelligence.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have great any of those.

[Speaker 2]
I have a plus seven wisdom. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Do that.

[Speaker 6]
You have a flat plus seven to wisdom? What? Oh, that's a saving throw.

That's not a check.

[Speaker 2]
That's a saving throw. My bad.

[Speaker 1]
The only person who has proficiency is Corpus. If somebody would like to do something to make you roll better... We all put your faith in the monk.

[Speaker 2]
It's going to put your faith in you.

[Speaker 1]
Just let them give you advice. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
I can give you a bardic inspiration.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Of course you can.

[Speaker 6]
I think Karas's would be higher.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, do Karas's. Yeah, I'm a bard nine. Of nine.

[Speaker 3]
I think mine is just a D8.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, a D8 and a space vehicle.

[Speaker 2]
How do you have space vehicle?

[Speaker 1]
From a background.

[Speaker 3]
What the hell is your background?

[Speaker 1]
My background is Wildspacer. I was born as a dwarf. That would do it.

[Speaker 6]
A fucking dwarf? What? Since when did that happen?

[Speaker 1]
I was born as a dwarf. Basically Deep Rock Galactic. Yeah, I think that was the assumption.

He's one of those.

[Speaker 3]
One of those.

[Speaker 1]
Rock and stone. Alright, so that's going to succeed. That's a check to basically keep the ship steady while you guys are moving along.

I'm going to need another check to avoid incoming artillery fire.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so what will that be?

[Speaker 1]
This would be something like quickly moving the wheel over. It could be sleight of hand in this case. It could be...

[Speaker 2]
I have a 17 in sleight of hand. Yeah, you go for it. I have an 11.

Good job.

[Speaker 1]
The spell cast on the incoming shells is what I meant to say. The 27, you're just going to as Hiscorpus is piloting this, you just quickly bump into the wheel and throw it off so that one of the incoming shells does not hit the cutter. There are a few demons aboard the ship on the decks.

We're coming over to the side of the decks. We're getting ready to just hurl motes of fire overboard. It's a little bit of a long arc.

It's a high arc that's going to rain down on you guys. I'll put a check to either evade that or to counter them in some way.

[Speaker 7]
Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
Would that be a sleight of hand?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think I'm going to let you guys use the same check twice.

[Speaker 3]
Let me look at my spells. I have mage hand. Bitch slap them to the side.

Does charm monster do anything?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. If nobody has anything, the alternative option is to just check for putting out the fires. It will get started on the boat itself.

[Speaker 6]
If they're non-magical, I would just delete them. Though if they're casting them, it's probably a magical fire.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I could use mage hand to get us out of the way. Steer us out of the way.

[Speaker 7]
Then would actual telekinesis work the spell that instead?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that mage hand would work. Telekinesis? I think telekinesis has a weight limit that would be beyond All right.

[Speaker 3]
Let's start figuring out how to put out fire. All right. This is how Charis dies.

I'm going to be so mad. Death by fire.

[Speaker 1]
Just a little bit of fire. It still will be.

[Speaker 3]
It's how her smuggler's crew died. She's not going out the same way. Come on.

[Speaker 2]
That's poetic irony, though.

[Speaker 3]
Right.

[Speaker 4]
Rain is a 30-foot cube. Amazing.

[Speaker 1]
30-foot cube. Destroy water.

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that will quickly wipe out most of your problems there.

[Speaker 7]
Huzzah.

[Speaker 1]
All right, next up, they're going to send down a few deities with not methods. What are the little imps? I believe imps?

No, no. Quasits are the ones from the abyss that are going to be in these little dinghies, trying to come up along the side of you guys and start clawing away at the cutter itself.

[Speaker 4]
Can we just open fire on them?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. If you'd like to use an attack roll as it. That's your check there.

[Speaker 4]
How many are there?

[Speaker 1]
It would be one check to represent the success of your attacks. But as far as how many there are, there are probably a dozen per dinghy, and there's about four going out, so around 50.

[Speaker 2]
Could I cast Cloud of Daggers in one of those ships?

[Speaker 1]
You could mow down one of them.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and between that, you guys have plenty of artillery fire of your own, so then you wouldn't have to worry about that. Yeah, that'd be totally fine.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, my follower's down completely. What the hell happened?

[Speaker 1]
He got smacked by a war.

[Speaker 6]
Is he down?

[Speaker 3]
He's down. He's death-safe.

[Speaker 6]
I can't see his healing. Would I be allowed to heal? Yes.

It's not really, really okay. I will mask your wounds.

[Speaker 2]
Show your tokens. Show what your health is.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you just have to hover over him. Hold on, let me fix that.

[Speaker 6]
I think it's hover only for owner.

[Speaker 3]
Ah. Always for everyone. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Um, six people. Uh, myself, Orion, Paris, um, Christopher, I can't see Lirion, I can't see whoever Heart has.

Um...

[Speaker 7]
I must have messed up their token thing.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I can't see this guy's either. There we go. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
You should be able to see it. It's hovered by anyone.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know why hover isn't working right now then. It's working for your companion but not you. Oh.

[Speaker 7]
I'll reset it again I guess. Can you see the bar now? No.

Well, how's your health doing? Oh, it's 75 out of 137. I should be okay.

How's the wolfy doing?

[Speaker 6]
It's basically halfway. Oh, halfway? Okay, then you can take it.

So, Hera, this guy, this guy, Heras, Phineas, and you. There we go, everyone get 37. Thank you.

I was like, why'd he only take 31?

[Speaker 2]
I realized he probably capped. I had that thought too, and then I was like, I exactly thought with my brain.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so last up is boarding. I need you guys to choose a means of getting onto the ship, like literally on top of the ship. If anybody has any to do with ropes, or with hoisting their fellow man upwards.

Other means of just like throwing a boat over. In a manner that's safe.

[Speaker 3]
Say that again?

[Speaker 1]
In a manner that's safe. Hoisting over, the goal now is to actually get on top of the ship. In a manner that's safe without getting smacked.

[Speaker 3]
If we should have some trailblazers, don't we have a ranger? Ranger?

[Speaker 6]
Ranger doesn't necessarily mean they picked the trailblazer.

[Speaker 2]
It's more likely though. Mimosa has a magic carpet we could just like... I could fly, so that would be fun.

[Speaker 4]
We have a bunch of flying companions. Oh!

[Speaker 3]
My wyvern!

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah. It can take at least two of us. I think the Mozamor can take three.

Oh, and Kyrona can misty step.

[Speaker 3]
Paris can fly.

[Speaker 5]
Kyron's got a griffon.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I think we can all make it. Good to go. Christopher has a dimension door so he'll take Monk with him.

Para can hang out with Mimosa.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's funny. It just moved all the way. What the fuck?

I just need to redo those wall objects. Alright, folks. I will be ready in about...

I'll be ready in about two minutes here. In the meantime, I will have you guys add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 3]
I'm scared to do anything.

[Speaker 4]
It's loading. Where do we put our token down?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I need to get alert or something for Kyrona. Her initiative is always so bad. Where do we put ourselves?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and put yourselves near the front of the ship.

[Speaker 3]
Very descriptive.

[Speaker 1]
Towards the bottom of the map.

[Speaker 2]
Imagine we're looking at a black screen.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what we're doing. I can't see anything still.

[Speaker 7]
We'll go here. Might take a second.

[Speaker 1]
All the light objects were deleted.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Oh, okay. Oops, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
I don't want to be here.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna die.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry, it's not actually a monster that's right there. There will be a... one.

Momentarily.

[Speaker 3]
Is this our ship?

[Speaker 1]
No, no. This is the enemy ship. It's the Yogi Mind Spider.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yippee.

[Speaker 5]
Redone by. I've redone most of my doors. Is there a...

Is there an item currently in Foundry for the Sword of Brilliance?

[Speaker 1]
I don't believe so.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. It's got... I think the only features we have identified is that, like, if you wield it, someone's gonna come attack you and it does force fire and radiant damage.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that you can actually attune to it just yet. You only identified it. Okay.

The castmates are going to be...

[Speaker 3]
I need to roll fuckin' initiative.

[Speaker 1]
My mouse is having an issue or had this issue where people double-clicking any time I try to use right-click. But it has gotten precipitously worse the past two nights, meaning I can... Any time I try to do anything on Foundry, I have, like, a...

I want to say an 80% chance of just bringing up a completely different menu that I did not want.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, dear.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. That brings us to Charis.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, boy. Um... Uh...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's my last third spell slot. Um... You know what?

Fuck it. Uh, this... This guy.

[Speaker 1]
He's found, but this particular dragonloth fails.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Awesome. Uh, was that enchantment?

It was enchantment. I'm gonna shoot... I'm gonna shoot this guy.

Okay. 17 hit?

[Speaker 1]
17 would hit, yes.

[Speaker 3]
33 damage. Ooh! Eat my glitter.

[Speaker 1]
Eat my glitter. And you were targeting the second fellow with that. Alright, good hits.

[Speaker 3]
Um... And she will... Oh, wait, is the ship moving?

[Speaker 1]
It's not moving in any... It's moving maybe in a relative sense, but you can still...

[Speaker 3]
Like, can I fly without being left behind?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I'll fly up in the air. Um... These things can fly.

Never mind. Fuck that. I'll stay right where I'm at.

No, come on up. I'll stay right where I'm at.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wow. That's interesting. These have a bunch of mind spiders.

Oh, I know why they have mind spiders. Okay. That's fine.

One of them is going to come down. Just gotta get rid of that. And this is invulnerable.

It's going to fly over this way. And it's going to attack the ranger.

[Speaker 4]
Dick move.

[Speaker 1]
And he misses. That would be his turn. Corpus, beginning of your turn, make me a dc12 saving throw.

Constitution, please. Constitution. You are safe and you do not fall unconscious.

Okay! I'm still raging from last session, right? No, you guys have to move along.

Okay, I... Let me do that real quick. I'm angry.

Move forward. 15 feet. No, this one.

I'll use one charge. Reckless. Hits.

Also hits. And that will be my turn. Sounds good.

The babal is going to move forward and attack this other person. Nessie! Okay.

Mimosa.

[Speaker 3]
I really picked the worst one to enchant. What the fuck? Oh, you couldn't have known.

I don't know about that. I could've. No, I should've done the one that's going now.

Um... Or... Or this one, the one that I shot, because it goes first.

Before the one... The one that I enchanted is the very second to last in the combat initiative.

[Speaker 1]
Corpus, make me a concert. Okay. Alright.

Alright, you make it. Take... 2d8 fire damage, which force you...

I'm not resistant to, so I take the full thing. At least that is his turn. That brings us to Christopher Pineus.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. And... Um...

Does anybody want to be large? Do we have a barbarian?

[Speaker 4]
Um...

[Speaker 5]
Purpose is...

[Speaker 2]
Kind of. You're quiet, Bar.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Bar, I'm supposed to remind you that you tilted your mic away.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, thank you. Uh... What about Meryl?

[Speaker 4]
Um, she's a paladin. Her being big would be interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Let's do it. Let's do it.

Oh, is the con... No. Is the concentration still broken?

Should I take it off?

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry about it. I would try taking it off.

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't really show that I'm allowed to. I don't see it anywhere to take it off. So, fine.

Alright, she's big.

[Speaker 1]
And anything for Christopher's bonus action?

[Speaker 2]
Um... Oh... That's a...

[Speaker 6]
Bardic inspo?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I guess I will Bardic inspo... Zakira?

Is there an X? It's a D8.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
And that's his...

[Speaker 1]
You can't move him anywhere. You still can.

[Speaker 2]
I would move him, but there's this fly right next to him. This fly creature.

[Speaker 1]
That's right.

[Speaker 2]
And I don't know if I want him to have an opportunity of attack.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me a constitution saving throw. TC12.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, to like, not throw up?

[Speaker 1]
But not go unconscious.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Sorry, what was the throw? Constitution, okay.

Oh, I don't think he's getting it.

[Speaker 1]
He would fail. Hold up. Hold up.

Can I use one of these bearer of remedy dice? Purpose, yes. D12.

[Speaker 2]
I, he... I, oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And I rolled a 12.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah! He's fine. He goes to fate and then is like, no, I'm stronger than this.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, pretty well. Gonna have a pretty simple turn, just gonna make a bunch of attacks versus... Wow, okay.

Only one hit. That's frustrating. Actually, never mind.

You would fall unconscious because 10 meters. So somebody else has to use their herbalist dice on.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I can.

[Speaker 1]
The babau is going to move this way. It is, doesn't have a choice. It will have to move out of the dreaded lost reach, which means it gets a free attack of opportunity.

Which one hit? No. Only applied half the damage.

No, the demons are not resistant to each other's attacks.

[Speaker 7]
Are they fighting each other?

[Speaker 1]
One of them has enemies of their own cast on it. Oh, here we go. Fear.

[Speaker 3]
One of them has to attack its own guys.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I see. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
I need wisdom saving throws from everybody that's in this cone here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy. Alright, Orion, you got this. Orion doesn't got this.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Orion did not, in fact.

[Speaker 3]
He did not got this. Goddammit.

[Speaker 2]
Poor Orion. He needs to stay in the city where he belongs. I mean, Pineus rolled a four, so they're...

[Speaker 1]
I thought you meant Monk and Mimosa as well.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it didn't show up that they were in it.

[Speaker 1]
They're like right in front of this thing. You're getting it.

[Speaker 2]
Can they both uncanny? Can they both dodge?

[Speaker 1]
It's not uncanny dodge, you just have to make a wisdom save. Alright, so Monk, Orion, and Christopher Pineus, I figure they're the only ones who failed that saving throw. Oh, we're scared?

Yes, those characters will have to use their action to run away. I'm going to use my movement five feet over here. I'll take an opportunity attack of opportunity from this thing.

What? I'll take an attack of opportunity from this thing so I can move here. So you moved away from...

I also need you to make me a saving throw at the start of your turn. Constitution, I'm assuming? Just made it.

And it misses. Okay. I'm going to be shooting this thing with a second level Hail of Thorns.

Let me make my normal attack roll real quick. And then the damage... Oh wow, I fucking hate this spell.

I need these three to make me Dex save. You need Mosa and Monk to also make those saving throws.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Dex save. Oh, we got this.

[Speaker 1]
You will likely take no damage from it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh wow.

[Speaker 3]
Thirty.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck this spell. It's fucking worthless. It's not impressive.

[Speaker 2]
Don't forget Zakira has Spartic Inspiration.

[Speaker 1]
Can I use that for my damage rolls?

[Speaker 6]
I think so. I know you can use it for spell damage rolls.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck, I'll keep that in mind. Can I just make a... Why did they change this?

[Speaker 4]
Let me pack an attack roll or saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
He makes his concentration check. Okay. I think for your second attack.

Yes, for my second attack I rolled a 20 on my attack and 15 on my damage roll. And it's towards the one casting the spell. I don't know which one's casting the spell.

It's the one that has the concentration thing. Okay, so this one. You also have a regular damage roll that I did not have earlier.

Yeah, my damage rolls were 16 and 15. This one was supposed to be down to 11 then, and then this one. Good.

Alright. And then Mimosa. You are not frightened, correct?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, correct? Yes, I think she passed.

[Speaker 1]
She passed. It's monk and it's just monk Orion.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, which monk has the stillness of mind, so he's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Um... Would you please make me a constitution saving throw at the beginning of your turn?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay. Is that good?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're fine. DC's 12.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, your cloud of dead.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, give me your damage. Why are you targeting Meryl?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, because, my bad.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus, it's 10d4 now?

[Speaker 2]
I have a lot of daggers.

[Speaker 1]
You do have a lot of daggers. Alright, those two are dead. The frightened are no longer frightened.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh! Okay. Um, and then I guess for my bonus action...

I will... Let's see, is Black Razor still full? Is his tummy still full?

[Speaker 3]
I mean, he did just, like, kill something really big, and you had to make Yeah, he's still feeling pretty full.

[Speaker 1]
The chasm right next to you is 25 feet in the air.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Okay, can I throw it at him? Yeah.

Um, and then that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that was... Oh, sorry, nope. Damage!

I have a migraine. Oh, and, um, bards get...

[Speaker 3]
Awesome. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
And all bards will cast spells at one level higher. Bringing us to Para.

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Um, I will roll at Constitution, because I think that's what everyone's been doing.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
Because that guy's just, like, right there.

[Speaker 1]
He's just kind of buzzing.

[Speaker 6]
Buzz off. Um... Let's see.

What do I feel like doing? What chaos am I going to ring? Oh, wait, this one is 30 feet.

Is that better? How big is 30 feet? My other one is 60, and I really want to do it, but...

It's a little obnoxious. Um... Yeah.

Okay, is there a difference that I can move this one?

[Speaker 3]
If he gets hit, does enemies abound end?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's right. Enemies abound end.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, let me put it in the charge. Let me just look.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Okay. Can I...

Can I blast between these two? Um... Phineas and Karina?

With the Sunbeam?

[Speaker 1]
Between Phineas and Karina?

[Speaker 6]
I'm not sure.

[Speaker 3]
Also, it wouldn't end. It would just have to make the save again.

[Speaker 1]
You get a second chance to make the save. Alrighty.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay. There we go. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Blizzard. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Five damage. Cool.

Takes out a hefty chunk of its health.

[Speaker 6]
And... it is blinded.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it's blinded.

[Speaker 2]
What can it suck to be a fly and be blind if you're used to seeing, like, everything all the time?

[Speaker 6]
And for the bonus action... I'm gonna harness some divine power.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that means we have Lirian up next.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, um... Bonus action to begin Blade Singing. Um...

I'm trying to do a living enemy count. It's like one... two...

three... four, and that's it? Okay.

I'm gonna cast... um... Steel Wind Strike!

Alrighty. Wait, why is it saying it's gonna take two slots? Does it take two slots to cast?

Oh, that's just how many I have available. Alright, nevermind. Alright.

So that's against that guy. This is against... this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So, no hit against the Dregloth that's... charmed.

But hits against the Casmay, both Casmays. Okay. I also need you to make me a concept at the start of your turn, I'm sorry.

I hope there's an easier way to, like, pop this out. Okay, good.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, um... Do I roll damage once, or roll damage per target?

[Speaker 1]
Your choice. Whichever one is faster for you.

[Speaker 5]
I will do... once. That's an attack roll.

No, that's a Steel Wind Strike damage roll.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Okay. Oh, it's just a pop-up for me.

Very good. I don't think that applied to all of them. Because it didn't.

There we go. Okay. None of those guys are looking particularly healthy.

Great.

[Speaker 5]
That's the end of the turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the Casmay is... the second Casmay is going to go up. It's going to fly downwards.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, bring my dagger back to me, please.

[Speaker 1]
Weedle, it's going to attempt to do this by attacking you.

[Speaker 2]
Yay! I get my dagger back. I was going to get backed by you.

[Speaker 8]
Aha!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, man. I think that does hit. Oh, man.

I'm going to dodge that.

[Speaker 1]
So that would halve the damage.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
The Necrotic was 28, so your hit point maximum is going to be reduced by 14.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That is the end of its turn. Bring us to Merrill.

[Speaker 4]
Do I need to do the Constitution save? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
You're good to go.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to move this way a little bit. If Monk doesn't mind, I'll stand up over here. And also, I'm going to have to stay up large.

[Speaker 1]
Don't tilt it back towards your face! Sorry! Also, this Kasmei has Blindsight, so it's going to attempt to attack you.

[Speaker 4]
There it is. There you go. Okay.

So, nobody can hear those damn bugs anymore.

[Speaker 1]
Man, fuck those bugs. Anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
That's a great question. I don't think I have any bonus action. Actually, yes, I do.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to have this Dragoloth tear apart the other Dragoloth while you're doing that.

[Speaker 4]
Anybody looking bad, health-wise?

[Speaker 8]
I'm chilling.

[Speaker 4]
I'll give... Oh no, I can't cast two spells in one round, can I?

[Speaker 1]
And you're in the silence. Your own silence.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well. Alright, then, no. Because I don't think I can attack as a bonus action.

Are we all silenced?

[Speaker 1]
If you're within the sphere.

[Speaker 4]
If you're in the sphere, you're silenced, but you can't hear the bugs. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So if you go outside the thing, then you can still cast your spell and go absolutely silent.

[Speaker 6]
How does that work for something like my Sunbeam, where I've already cast it?

[Speaker 1]
You've already cast it, so there's no negative interaction with it. Alright, the Dragoloth went over and attacked the other Dragoloth, hitting once and nearly knocking it down, bringing us to Kyrona. Okay.

This chimes me already. Use their attack of opportunity. Or use their reaction.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going through my spells real quick to see what I can do without both of them.

[Speaker 1]
You can move on to the Prowl, the ship, if I'm fired.

[Speaker 4]
I'll do that.

[Speaker 1]
Then you won't have any restrictions.

[Speaker 4]
Why do I hear... Oh, that might be in the music that I'm listening to. Yeah.

I was hearing Edith Piaf. What? I'm listening to music and apparently in the background of the music is Edith Piaf.

[Speaker 1]
No, that was a... That was a what of a... surprise.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know. I'll attack the same guy twice. Oh, and I cast bonus action.

Wow.

[Speaker 1]
X or Hunter's Mark.

[Speaker 4]
Hunter's Mark. Mark, who are you firing at? There you go.

One or both?

[Speaker 1]
The first one will kill him.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Then transfer the other one over to this guy.

[Speaker 1]
We'll take the hit so he will get another save versus enemies bound. It was an intelligence save and it was a DC... What's your save DC, Charis?

[Speaker 3]
18.

[Speaker 1]
18. Alright, he will succeed that one.

[Speaker 7]
Just a quick question. Did I get removed from initiative? I pulled a 13 and we're down to Corona.

[Speaker 1]
You didn't get removed from initiative.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I don't see that.

[Speaker 1]
You added yourself to initiative. Alright, Dr. Bacio.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a way to add... Dr. Bacio?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to have Dr. Bacio go now and I'm going to manually update the initiative to 13.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Oh, right, I'm silenced. Hold on, let me get out of that for a second and then...

Hi! Bug's blinded, bug's blinded. I can move it away from people so it doesn't stab folk.

That. If I retch away and tug the one right by me, can it... oh.

Okay, the thing isn't popping up, but can you make it do a strength saving throw?

[Speaker 1]
Can.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, it fails. So I'm just gonna It is now restrained, correct? It's restrained.

And I will...

[Speaker 3]
Is it flying? Not anymore, because it's restrained.

[Speaker 7]
And I'll just pull it a little bit away so it stops stabbing people with its proboscis.

[Speaker 1]
Back here.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. There we go. And that will be my turn for now.

Oh wait, no, getting back down so I don't fall off. And then back to the ground. Then that's my turn.

Here's the bug.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Oh, he's under a big lady. I'm sure he likes it.

Don't be surprised. Nope. Well, okay, here's the thing.

I can't get to Monk. Oh, sorry, I'll move. I got it.

He's moving here. Wait, what is happening with this thing? He's restrained.

Oh, he's restrained. Okay, so I can just kill him. Yes.

Easy prey. Awesome!

[Speaker 7]
I believe you have advantage against him, too. Because, you know. He is restrained.

[Speaker 1]
You do have advantage. That definitely hits.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he's dead. Cool. And since he's no longer frightened, I guess that'll just be his turn.

[Speaker 1]
He wasn't frightened to begin with because the guy concentrating on fear was dead.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's what I meant.

[Speaker 1]
Anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 2]
Eh, no.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. All right.

[Speaker 2]
Who's left? Just that other bug guy.

[Speaker 1]
And the droid up top.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, all right.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna target this guy. And... Doesn't it whispers?

[Speaker 1]
I don't really care. It has verbal components. You're gonna have to move out of the sphere first.

[Speaker 3]
I'll fly out. I can fly all the way up. As far up as I can out of the bubble.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You'll have to poke your little mouth through. Yeah.

Well, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
My instrument. Anyway, I'm gonna go back down some so that if I fall I don't die. And shoot.

[Speaker 1]
You already made your save against the things here. For 24 hours, I believe.

[Speaker 3]
Amazing. I can still... I still have a fear of falling.

28. That hits. 18 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Looking pretty bad.

[Speaker 3]
Good. And then I have... No, that was my bonus action.

All right, we're good.

[Speaker 1]
Bring this to Corpus. It's time to smack things. No charges.

We're just gonna reckless and finish this the old-fashioned way. Miss. Just barely.

All right. Bonus action. Flurry of Blues.

And that's my turn. Is it dead? No, it's not about...

Bring us to Christopher. Christopher Pineas.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Huh.

[Speaker 3]
If anybody wants to use my follower here he can shoot.

[Speaker 2]
All right. I'm going to...

[Speaker 8]
Camp.

[Speaker 2]
It's just this here snoggery.

[Speaker 1]
It's not naked. Fair. Good?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Sigura. If you have any bonus actions.

[Speaker 2]
Nah, it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
All right. I'm gonna use my bonus action to second wind. Just heal up a little bit.

And then, we shoot things. And that's my turn. Just really simple.

Very good. He's nearly dead. That brings us to...

Mimosa.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. Go... The 20 hit.

[Speaker 1]
It will hit.

[Speaker 2]
Sneak attack damage. And then I'll put the sneak attack damage also on this guy.

[Speaker 1]
I believe... That almost kills the Trigoboth. It does kill the Jasmine.

[Speaker 2]
Gotcha. Okay. Um...

[Speaker 1]
And your second attack.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I guess I will throw my dagger at it. Wow.

That's 15 hit.

[Speaker 1]
15 just hits.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
And 8 hit points left.

[Speaker 2]
I collected my daggers. Yippee.

[Speaker 1]
That's a lot of daggers.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah. How many knives are you up to now?

[Speaker 2]
A lot. I hit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

[Speaker 7]
Nice. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
It's amazing.

[Speaker 8]
Honestly love that for you. I know, same.

[Speaker 1]
What is the party doing now?

[Speaker 3]
Is everything dead?

[Speaker 5]
I feel like we're going to have to check out. We still need to kill the drones, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we need to move up the ship.

[Speaker 5]
Are we still in initiative? I thought everything else was dead.

[Speaker 3]
So no, we're good. We can move freely.

[Speaker 1]
You're still on a timer, if you will.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, yeah, I guess we're just moving through clearing it. I think Meryl is going to kick the door down. Oh boy, how long does Ennard's reduce last?

10 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, nobody else. Everybody who's behind, I shall destroy.

[Speaker 3]
Harrison's up in the air. So if this is a ground level thing, Paris probably won't be affected.

[Speaker 1]
It is. I need everybody in this cone to make me a dexterity saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
You got this, bud. Yeesh. Paris is fine, though.

Damn it, Orion. You're fucking useless.

[Speaker 1]
Create DC 12.

[Speaker 6]
So frustrating. Whoa, whoa.

[Speaker 1]
Those of you who succeeded will, or those of you who failed will take 38 damage. Those of you who succeeded will take half.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy, okay. Who dropped?

[Speaker 6]
Heart.

[Speaker 5]
There we go.

[Speaker 3]
Orion's down again.

[Speaker 5]
What kind of damage is there? Is it bludgeoning? This will be, I think this will be cursing us.

[Speaker 1]
It's a great shot.

[Speaker 6]
Orion gets a reaction healing word.

[Speaker 1]
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to have you guys add yourselves to the initiative. We're going to do group initiative for this one.

As you guys recall, group initiative is where one of you will roll initiative and one of the enemies is going to roll initiative. We'll have to group it out. This is the path of the bowels.

[Speaker 4]
Not me. I have a terrible luck.

[Speaker 5]
I've got okay attacks.

[Speaker 2]
Malos has a plus five and advantage.

[Speaker 5]
Do it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. And once one of your teammates rolls initiative, the next round they cannot roll initiative for you again. Ditto for the monsters.

Those of you who had duration effects, they will be decreased by one round, but you will still be able to. They're still ongoing.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
We're rolling initiative again? A group initiative.

[Speaker 1]
It's group initiative, so add yourself to the initiative. Only whichever side rolls highest and we're going to roll each round is going to go. And once one person rolls for your side, they can't roll again.

[Speaker 5]
It's a round robin.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. And your side is going to go first because most have rolled higher.

[Speaker 6]
Let me squeak in here and blast them before anyone gets in there.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I want a fireball as well.

[Speaker 7]
Let me rotate this.

[Speaker 2]
All the spellcasters can go first, it seems. That would be a good idea.

[Speaker 7]
I'll move a bit forward so I can see this nerd.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Are these Mariliths? They are.

Do we know if Mariliths are resistant to fire? Is there a damage type that we want to be preferring against these guys? Roll recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, basically go ahead and make me an Arcana check.

[Speaker 6]
Can you pop out the thing or can you redo the my sunbeam? Yeah, I'm going to redo my sunbeam. I also lost it.

[Speaker 7]
Can I try for the Marilith I'm targeting can you make her do a strength save? I'm going to silvery barbs that to see if she fails it.

[Speaker 6]
Actually, instead of silvery barbsing, I'm going to use some dice. Oh, it's con save. Oh, okay.

Yeah. Wait, am I close enough? I'm not close enough.

Am I?

[Speaker 1]
It's a...

[Speaker 7]
Did I say con save? No, I was going.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. He's doing the Paris thing.

[Speaker 7]
Ah, first. Sorry.

[Speaker 6]
I don't have the range. If you want to silvery barbs it.

[Speaker 7]
Or if you want to save that for your thing, you can do that as well. You know what? Yeah, I'll save it for now then.

[Speaker 1]
Two of my battles are dead. And the Dreguloth is blinded.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to move away.

[Speaker 1]
The bludgeoning for D6. The initial bludgeoning damage. Okay.

How are my Mariliths? One of them AP. AP saved.

Try that again. But the Mariliths failed. And you said one of the Mariliths needs to make a strike save versus restrained.

[Speaker 7]
Is that correct? Yeah. It's versus...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. That sounds like a question. Do you know what it means?

[Speaker 7]
Yes. It's against... I guess it's against restrained because of how telekinesis works.

Yeah. Does 21 make it? Nope.

Can I pick her up and shove her off the boat? Is that enough distance? Are you asking me?

Yes, yes. Let me do the measuring tool. Yeah, she can come off the boat.

What's the distance? I can move her up to 30 feet. So...

Let me ping it in chat.

[Speaker 3]
Are these snake ladies? Are they considered monsters or are they people? Can we befriend them?

[Speaker 8]
They're fiends.

[Speaker 1]
You can bind them.

[Speaker 2]
Nah. It's better if they're befriended. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
There are always deals to be made as well. Alright, so that was Lirian and Hera and Octobashio.

[Speaker 6]
Can I actually use my bonus action as well?

[Speaker 7]
I can't physically move the token so if you don't mind could you shift her off the... That's not the... That's not the one I targeted though.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Ah, yeah, no. It was this one. The one that hadn't been damaged yet.

Okay, so that's 20 feet and that's 30 feet. Oh, well, I'll do one more. It's okay.

I can shove her off still. You got her closer to me. Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about that. That's where I need the silvery barbs. One second.

Ha ha ha. There. I'll get my intern to do it.

Oh, Jesus. Well, it's fine. She has disadvantage on everything.

I apologize.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And anything else do we have in the party? Meryl hasn't gone yet.

Yeah. Meryl and Kyrona have not gone yet. None of mine have gone yet.

Yes, and none of Netsie's have gone yet. I don't think Froggertha has gone yet either.

[Speaker 3]
I have not gone yet. Um, I can though, unless that was somebody rolling initiative.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's side-based initiative, so everyone on our team goes, then everyone on their team goes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, do you want me to go next? Go for it. 21.

[Speaker 1]
No, you don't. No, no, no. Go ahead and take your actions.

And then...

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I will shoot then. Oh, no, I'm gonna heroism and then shoot. Uh, who is over here?

Where's... Um, I will give... Oh, Orion's...

Oh, did he not get the healing? Um... When?

[Speaker 6]
Right now? Right when he went down.

[Speaker 3]
I don't recall.

[Speaker 1]
It was a reaction, so Orion is healed. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, he got 17.

[Speaker 3]
17, thank you. I did not catch that at all. Um, okay.

You know what? I'm gonna give him heroism. He gets...

Huh?

[Speaker 1]
And then go ahead and do your gunfire.

[Speaker 3]
And then my gunfire, okay.

[Speaker 1]
He gets his 510.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, my dinner got delivered. Did I miss anything important?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, you get to go. Let's see. Let's see.

I think it's gonna be disadvantage if it's close. Like 5 feet.

[Speaker 3]
I'm up in the sky.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and indicate yourself as being higher up.

[Speaker 3]
Um, how do I? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Click and then it's at the top left of token. There you go. Alright, still need...

And now we just need Nessie, Bar, and... We need Nessie, Bar, and Rez. Should I go now?

Go! Go! Anybody should.

[Speaker 2]
Monk can't see anything on this ship. What is happening?

[Speaker 5]
Um, is it possible to take copper? Oh yeah, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, this might help Nessie. I think I am lit up anyway.

[Speaker 2]
His disarranged, for some reason, is 0.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
On his token.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know why. I am lit up, so.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, thank you. It's an 18 hit.

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage versus the... If... yeah.

It's not going to hit because she's going to use parry. I'm applying them as they go.

[Speaker 2]
I keep losing the button because... Yeah, that's why I'm waiting.

[Speaker 1]
And then... Time to find out... Buck around and find out Stunning Strike.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. Well, you see. Herbalist dice.

I will use 3d8s.

[Speaker 1]
And does it pass? A dc26.

[Speaker 7]
Well done. I think it is stunned.

[Speaker 4]
Are you done with your turn, Corpus?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, that's Corpus. Zecura will go after you. Monk has to finish their attacks and then...

And then Bolet Marrow goes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so the parry didn't... Or he didn't hit?

[Speaker 1]
The parry would make that one not hit, but Monk still has the rest of their attacks left. And they're at advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, at advantage. He's not rolling advantage.

[Speaker 4]
That's blurry and low.

[Speaker 1]
Misses!

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Now he's done. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, that was damage.

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage. Second type of hit.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Two hits. And let's see.

I am getting a 1d4 bonus from being picked. Okay. And Corona.

What's going on in the cloud back here?

[Speaker 1]
That is an ice storm.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, can I fire into it?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. There's nothing keeping you from doing that.

[Speaker 4]
How much damage is that ice storm doing?

[Speaker 1]
It's not... It's not continuous, I don't think. It's everybody in the area.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I think it does one more burst of damage at the end of the next round. Pop it out. Where does it second turn?

[Speaker 4]
I chose to do that and then I didn't pick what kind of elemental I wanted before I picked.

[Speaker 1]
Contra Elemental takes an hour to cast.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Okay, never mind that. No, it says it takes a minute to cast.

It lasts for an hour, but it does take a minute, so I will not do that.

[Speaker 1]
It also hits.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that's it.

[Speaker 1]
I will mark this one. Did you want to move your Hunter's Mark to this one as well, right? Yep.

Alright. We have Zakura and Mimosa still. Yes, Zakura will go.

I'm going to shoot at this thing in the back. I don't know what it's called. Those Babels are dead.

Oh, they're dead. Okay. I will shoot at this Marilith here.

I don't know what status effect that is, but... Hunter's Mark, okay. That's somebody else's Hunter's Mark.

Suffer Strike. Advantage. Roll your damage.

There you go. I'm going to use my movement to get into a little safer position. I'm going behind.

There we go. And Mimosa. Mimosa's a shield.

[Speaker 2]
What is the effect in here?

[Speaker 1]
It's just difficult terrain.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
A bunch of Hailstones in there.

[Speaker 3]
What effect does this snake lady have? Hunter's Mark. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Does that get both of them?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I don't know. She's a little bit far outside of it. I don't know.

She's like half in.

[Speaker 2]
I can change it.

[Speaker 1]
She's like between half of the space. Alright, yeah. There she'd be in.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Do that, and then we use a bonus action to hit. Do that.

And then...

[Speaker 1]
I think it's trying to apply your strength modifier instead of your dexterity modifier. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Weird. Why?

[Speaker 1]
I do not know, but I will add 6 to that damage.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And then I'm going to... No, I think I'll stay there, because I used all my movement.

[Speaker 1]
It's their turn! The remaining baboons are going to load and aim the cannon, but do not have enough people to fire it. The Marilith is going to attack Nessie here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Six attacks with its long sword and one with its tail. It's going to be fun.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Two hits out of those and then one hit for the tail.

[Speaker 2]
Ouchies. I'm going to uncanny dodge the one that takes the most damage.

[Speaker 1]
You gotta choose them one at a time.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, fine. The second one.

[Speaker 1]
Good choice. And I'll also grapple and restrain. I should have done that first.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Is that all the damage?

[Speaker 1]
That's all the damage. So the dragoloth is going to go over and he's blinded.

[Speaker 8]
Why?

[Speaker 1]
So he's going to have... He's going to bump in and I guess I make these as normal. Miss.

[Speaker 2]
Ouchies.

[Speaker 1]
Lolz. And then a critical fail on that last one. Eighteen damage.

That's really good.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, I could have done that. Ugh.

[Speaker 1]
It is all the enemies, sir. Because the remaining... What's the remaining merolith is stunned.

So I'm going to need... Which one of these here has the highest dexterity score? I need one person...

I need a new person to roll their initiative. This might be best.

[Speaker 3]
Can I have a plus six to initiative?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, she's best.

[Speaker 3]
I guess I'll roll. Let's hope this works.

[Speaker 1]
You got this.

[Speaker 7]
Yay!

[Speaker 1]
I rolled a thirteen. Alright, so that party goes first. And I don't think...

I'll let you guys confer. Okay, so I want the people who are doing ranged attacks to go first, the people who are doing melee attacks to go second, and the people who are doing spells to go third.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I'll start with Sekiro targeting this merolith over here. She's still stunned.

Oh, so it'd be with advantage. Nah, that first roll's meant to be with advantage, so... That is...

twenty-nine in total. She takes it. Anybody else doing ranged attacks?

If you do elixir splice, I suppose you're technically using a bow for it still.

[Speaker 4]
Are we in a new round? Yep. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And you will find that in...

[Speaker 4]
Same target as before, unless she's down.

[Speaker 1]
That kills her.

[Speaker 4]
The first one does. Then I will target her. Which then kills her.

[Speaker 3]
I can shoot, but first I should do a spell. I haven't done a second level. Is it alright if I go?

[Speaker 1]
If you're doing a spell, you're gonna go third.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm doing a spell and a gun. So I can shoot, though.

[Speaker 1]
Let's do third. Keep that process simple. Alright, melee people.

[Speaker 6]
Would Mimosa still be restrained if that one died?

[Speaker 7]
Nope. Haha!

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Orion does shooting. I'll just go after. With him.

Keep forgetting about him. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Paralith is dead. Oh. Well then, I'll...

I should be able to make this. Should. So, uh...

[Speaker 3]
An eleven probably doesn't hurt, but we'll be...

[Speaker 1]
Not an eleven hits. It's a cannon. Doesn't really have a lot of patience.

Oh. We'll take an additional eleven. Okay.

A Scorpus. I see. Monk.

Meryl.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Meryl's gonna move in. He's gonna have a hard time getting to anybody there, I guess.

Let's go get that guy.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I should have done last turn. Let's just do melee and then... He's perished.

He's very perished.

[Speaker 4]
Any leftover damage goes into kicking the cannon.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. It is loaded. Careful.

I'll tank it. Ninosa. And Lirion, are you planning on casting a spell, or are you planning on splicing and dicing?

Phineas is remitted.

[Speaker 2]
Does a seventeen hit this guy?

[Speaker 1]
It does. He has an AC50. He's also blinded.

[Speaker 2]
Does that give me advantage?

[Speaker 1]
Mhm.

[Speaker 8]
He gives you sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll do the sneak attack damage first. For the last one.

[Speaker 1]
Ouch.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Um...

[Speaker 1]
Everybody on the...

[Speaker 2]
Is the cannon still alive? Do we need to deactivate it?

[Speaker 1]
It's a cannon.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Could we use the cannon? Yeah. Neat.

[Speaker 1]
We need somebody to move it and fire it.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, somebody strong.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl. Yep, Meryl can single-handedly move it, probably. You want me to roll for it?

[Speaker 1]
So, we're going to take a short break, and then hopefully Phineas gets back, and then I... Actually bring some water.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Hey, I am back.

[Speaker 4]
Too bad, we're taking a break anyway.

[Speaker 7]
I'll be right back. I unfortunately have to leave a little early. Are you sure?

Unfortunately, yes. No, I cannot escape this. Alas, I would most definitely want to stay, because we're in the middle of a fight and it's awesome, but yeah, I might have to leave really soon.

I guess they'll just be there for now. If I do manage to come back, that would be neat, but I doubt it. Catch you guys another time.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks for hanging out with us while you could. Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
I hope you guys have a great fight. We will try not to die. Do your best!

It would be most devastating if I came back and all of you were just wiped out.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, buh-bye. Bye. Oh, I'm so tired.

[Speaker 2]
Me too. Hey! No, thank you.

Yeah, I'm watching you. Good punk. Man, they learned how to open the double doors for the washing machine and they get out my little dryer balls and throw them around the house.

Ugh! So annoying. Got like six little sheep wool balls and then two puffer fish thingies.

I wonder if they make little froggy ones.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm? I said I wonder if they make little froggy ones. Oh, I'm sure they do.

My mom's cat has been playing with some ping pong balls that she got for a craft project recently.

[Speaker 3]
Mine liked bottle caps and the tops of plastic bottles.

[Speaker 2]
Anytime I got a cat toy, my kids played with it. Anytime they had little baby shoes or something like that, my cat played with it. My cat loved little baby shoes.

Can you blame them? They're adorable. I mean, she'd bunny kick them like a ball of yarn.

Cuteness aggressions. Yeah. For whatever reason, they were her favorite texture and size to play with, but any other cat-specific toy was not her thing.

Yeah, you stuck.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, god. Back up, back up.

[Speaker 3]
I shall be right back.

[Speaker 2]
I made a cobbler. I'm gonna go eat some. Oh, yum!

I was thinking of making a new one for my birthday. Either a cobbler or like a crumb. Crisp, excuse me.

Strawberry crisp or something. Oh, my gosh. The first one is my favorite.

The first frog. The second one looks unsettling.

[Speaker 8]
I am back.

[Speaker 4]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 8]
I was there.

[Speaker 3]
I have returned. And I have, I think it's blackberry cobbler. Maybe it's blueberry.

It might be blackberry. I don't know. I don't remember.

[Speaker 4]
It's cobbler with a berry of some color. Yeah, it's delicious.

[Speaker 1]
Something tasty.

[Speaker 3]
I cannot tell what. I do not remember. It's purple, that's all I know.

We will see in a minute when I bite into it. I made this like a couple of hours ago. How do I not remember?

[Speaker 2]
Did you have some assistance when you did it?

[Speaker 3]
The only assistance I had was my mother. Okay. I think it's blackberry.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Everybody back here.

[Speaker 6]
Heart had to leave.

[Speaker 8]
Damn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so Bar is continuing with the...

[Speaker 4]
I'm continuing with the what?

[Speaker 1]
Continuing with the cannon in hand.

[Speaker 4]
Yes. Well, I was just going to point it at the next door. Right, okay.

I like that idea. Fire it when I open it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to move forward a little bit.

[Speaker 1]
Because we ended on spellcasters last round, if you guys would like, you can... If the spellcasters win the initiative, I will allow that to take first, and then we'll follow up with range and then melee.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, when that door gets blasted open, I will sling a spell and shoot. Well, no, because the hit...

Yeah. I was trying to figure out if I was going to be doing ranged or... I've never used booming blade.

[Speaker 1]
Booming blade? It's actually a lot of fun. If you only have one attack, it's a lot of fun.

It's a lot of fun.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have to... Is it an attack, or is it an enhancement to an attack?

[Speaker 1]
It's a spell that you cast as an action, and as part of that spell, you make an attack.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If folks would like to open the door, they may do so.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, if I open the door, somebody's going to fire the cannon?

[Speaker 3]
Can we fire the cannon through the door?

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I thought we would open it first to make sure there's somebody there.

[Speaker 1]
Well, then it's an issue.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, go ahead and fire it. Why?

[Speaker 1]
It's going to destroy a chest with a magic item inside. Go ahead and make me an attack roll. Add six.

[Speaker 2]
Who's manning the cannon?

[Speaker 6]
Meryl.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Ability check?

[Speaker 1]
Ability check? Oh, sure. I mean, technically it's an attack roll.

It's just adding six for the cannon itself, but that will... These guys are going to succeed.

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and roll 8d10.

[Speaker 4]
And I have advantage because I'm a bigot. That's not better. Alright, so you said 8d10?

[Speaker 8]
Mhm.

[Speaker 4]
Seriously?

[Speaker 5]
That's pretty rough.

[Speaker 4]
I got five ones.

[Speaker 5]
That's really rough.

[Speaker 8]
That is some fucking RNG if I've ever seen it. Holy shit.

[Speaker 5]
You didn't roll anything above an 8, so it might as well have been 8d8.

[Speaker 1]
And my boys do what they should do. There was a misfire, you know? Alright, somebody go ahead and, who has not gone to SBX, go ahead and make an initiative roll for your party.

Who hasn't gone, aside from...

[Speaker 6]
I think Mimosa and Charis are the only ones who have gone.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that makes sense. I have a plus four. I think that's higher than me.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'll go 17. Exit by a little bit. Alright, so spellcasters, then people making ranged attacks, then melee attacks.

[Speaker 5]
Is that the bailer?

[Speaker 1]
That's the bailer. Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, who's going right now?

[Speaker 1]
Spellcasters.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, spellcasters. I put it in voiceover flow. Alright.

Who can I see move forward? No, I'm not moving forward, fuck that. Alright, I'm gonna attack this guy.

Um... No, I don't want to hideous laughter him.

[Speaker 1]
Um... Remember, all bards get the cast at a level higher, thanks to being used the dagger earlier.

[Speaker 3]
I'll dissonant whispers him. What is that, like a... Hold on, could I...

No.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, dissonant whispers I believe does like an extra... I think it does an extra B6 damage for each level above first. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I will hideous laughter him. So if I'm casting hideous laughter at a level 1, I can cast it at a level 2 for free?

[Speaker 1]
Mmhmm.

[Speaker 3]
At the cost of a level 1 slot.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So I'll just give myself a... He needs to make a...

Okay, well. I'm also gonna shoot him.

[Speaker 1]
Boom.

[Speaker 5]
Take my glitter.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Any other spellcasters?

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Yeah, I'm gonna cast... Um...

Hold monster.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we're inside right now. I should probably not be 20 feet high.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, I don't have the spell slot for it. I'm gonna roll... I'm actually gonna use my staff of command.

I'm gonna use the 10 charges to dominate monster. So I need to roll a D20 since I expended the last charge. Does not...

Does not spontaneously explode. And that's gonna be... My spell safety C is...

19. We'll succeed. Barely made it.

[Speaker 1]
Just barely.

[Speaker 5]
And then, let's see, I think I've got 7 more rounds when my blade's on. Yeah, that's it. Alright, Para.

[Speaker 1]
And... And a lion. No, Christopher Pineus.

Ha ha ha!

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'm gonna... I don't know what Para wants to do, but I want to try to antagonize.

[Speaker 6]
What does antagonize do?

[Speaker 2]
It might help me. Make one monster attack another of my choice.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. I'm gonna Guiding Bolt the Balor.

[Speaker 1]
You do still have your spell.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, my Sunbeam. But there's like 5 billion friends in the way. And I don't want to get that close.

[Speaker 1]
So... You're a little closer. Come on.

[Speaker 2]
My plan is to try to get this guy to attack the bigger one.

[Speaker 1]
Easily done. Did anybody have... Did anybody cast Silvered Barbs?

[Speaker 6]
Heart cast it like twice, but didn't say who got the advantage.

[Speaker 1]
You got the advantage for that?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
You get the advantage. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I don't have to worry about that.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so now anyone who hits him gets advantage.

[Speaker 1]
The next attack against him has advantage.

[Speaker 6]
The next advantage, yes.

[Speaker 1]
I need to go against... Which? I can succeed.

[Speaker 3]
Lame. I keep forgetting to shoot him with Orion. When can I do that?

[Speaker 1]
Well, somebody did just hit, so you can do that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Is it the Heavy Rifle or the Smoothbore that does more damage?

[Speaker 1]
Smoothbore does more damage, but it needs to be reloaded. Well, it needs to be... You can fire it once before needing to reloading.

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Does a 16 hit?

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to roll to attack. It's when anybody hits.

[Speaker 3]
Then... Boom.

[Speaker 2]
He gets 18 damage. The ugly pig guy only gets half damage.

[Speaker 1]
Only half. That's an interesting story.

[Speaker 2]
Damn. Didn't really look like...

[Speaker 1]
A wee bit of damage. Alright, range detectors are up next.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to have Monk shoot.

[Speaker 1]
That's right. That barely hits. Stop for a second so I can apply the damage.

[Speaker 2]
Nope.

[Speaker 3]
It's Blueberry Cobbler. Alright. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Are you firing at any other creatures as well?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see. Yeah. This guy.

This guy. This guy. Do I roll?

Go ahead and roll. Can I attack?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Damn.

[Speaker 4]
Just kidding! Okay. Has everyone else ranged gone?

[Speaker 1]
Sekiro is about to finish up his turn and then it'll be a good turn for Kyrona.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Boom. And who's that against? The Balor.

Misses. Just misses. And bonus action.

Let's get a bit of resistance and teleport there. Not a bad idea. Kyrona.

Don't worry.

[Speaker 4]
My spell slots don't make sense. I already know that.

[Speaker 1]
I think that's all of them.

[Speaker 4]
And unfortunately also Kyrona. Taris, move back. But yep.

Deck saves. Oh boy. Wait, can I move?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you certainly should. There's nobody preventing you from doing so.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. And I'll move. I'm five feet up.

I think I can get on top of this guy and still be safe.

[Speaker 4]
Holy shit. Oh my god. You sure about that, buddy?

[Speaker 1]
I got three successes. I'm pretty sure I got everybody selected.

[Speaker 4]
And that is a three trigger loss.

[Speaker 1]
And the shadow demon succeeded. So... Sorry.

Two out of three trigger loss succeeded.

[Speaker 4]
I rolled three twos and two threes. I might be cursed.

[Speaker 1]
You might be.

[Speaker 4]
Bro, why are you sitting in the dark?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. I think it just got darker out. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's called sunset.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. What's the big deal? I'm sorry.

Did you want me to stop the sun?

[Speaker 4]
No. I want you to turn on a light. No.

[Speaker 3]
What, you're telling me you're not sitting in the dark, too? I'm not.

[Speaker 4]
I have lamps turned on. I have ever since the sun started going down.

[Speaker 6]
It's nice when he has it dark, though, because I don't see him and think he's a spider for a split second.

[Speaker 1]
How did you think I was a spider for a split second? You're getting worse. You're getting worse.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I have three monitors and you are just in the upper corner of the one that's like, I'm not paying attention to. So it's just like this slight movement that goes across my screen. So I move my hands like this.

Ha ha. It wasn't a while.

[Speaker 8]
At least expecting it.

[Speaker 6]
Except he's in the dark now, so I actually can't see.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 6]
And he's worried.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good incentive. That's right, I am still on.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's having a hard time focusing on your face because you're in the dark.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, no, that exploits it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, who's going?

[Speaker 1]
I believe that was all of our ranged attackers. Now it's time for the melee. And then it will be the demon's turn.

[Speaker 4]
What is this big aura that I missed? What's the giant circle? That's just time for Bally.

It was a one and done.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Can a melee person decide who wants to go first if she can have an opportunity attack? Not an opportunity attack.

[Speaker 6]
Advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, my head hurts.

[Speaker 6]
Sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Hell yeah, that counts.

[Speaker 4]
Do I get advantage?

[Speaker 1]
For what?

[Speaker 4]
For Mimosa being next to me?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. Mimosa was doing that so that she would get a sneak attack. Sneak attack requires either advantage or an ally.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
You go ahead and do your thing.

[Speaker 2]
You want me to go first? Okay. We're all so quiet again, just so you know.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry. You got a little Midwestern there, just so you know.

[Speaker 4]
I know. I lived in Minnesota for a year, and my cat is named Toast. But while I was living in Minnesota, I started pronouncing my cat Toast's name as Toast.

[Speaker 5]
Toast.

[Speaker 2]
Does a 16 hit?

[Speaker 1]
16 misses.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. My sister was stationed in North Dakota, and when I visited her for like a month, he made me practice my O's and sounding like that, so I don't know why. Yeah, see, it's stuck.

It's just gonna... It's just a thing.

[Speaker 5]
Hey there, friendly neighbor-o.

[Speaker 2]
I know. And then... Oh, let's see.

And then this guy can get that sneak attack damage, too.

[Speaker 6]
I think that vibe does just fit Mimosa, though.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, jeez. What damage? There you go.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And then, for my last attack, my bonus action attack... I'll do this guy again.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna replay. You just miss! And also you take 14 damage.

[Speaker 2]
Can he dodge?

[Speaker 1]
There we go. It's not an attack. Simply take it.

[Speaker 2]
I intimidate it away.

[Speaker 1]
You do not intimidate the fire.

[Speaker 2]
I do! Anyway.

[Speaker 1]
You're misbehaving.

[Speaker 2]
I always misbehave. What is that? It's blurry because it's dark and up close.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm gonna attack the bailer now. I don't have advantage from anything.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Miss!

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that one hit.

[Speaker 1]
You also take 14 fire damage.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's fine. My highest spell spot is 3, I think? No, I have some 4th level, so that will be 6.

The maximum... Okay, so I can do 48 from the spell slot level and then another 48 because it's doubled from being a fiend.

[Speaker 1]
So it's 2d8 for a 1st level spell slot plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st blah blah blah. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a fiend or undead, so that does it once.

[Speaker 4]
But it says to a maximum of...

[Speaker 1]
Right. So the maximum that you can do with a divine smite is 6d8.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I see. Okay, then I will do...

[Speaker 1]
Unless it crits, because that overrides the... It's not looking so great.

[Speaker 4]
Fucker.

[Speaker 1]
Plus you took 14 fire damage.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, I applied that. Alright, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 5]
Very good. Anybody else? Yeah, you should know better than to come around these here parts, eh?

[Speaker 4]
No. We've started something terrible.

[Speaker 1]
Corpus. Move forward. Move even more forward.

Alright, so I saw that when people hit the baler, they take fire damage. That's correct. Fuck.

Isn't that just melee? It's probably just melee.

[Speaker 5]
It is melee.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wait. I'm resistant to fire. I'm immune?

I know I'm resistant to fire.

[Speaker 5]
You're just making stuff up now? No, I'm resistant to fire. Oh, yeah.

And I remembered that I'm actually 7 feet tall. It's pretty cool.

[Speaker 2]
Bleh.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, Corpus, take a turn.

[Speaker 4]
I used two charges.

[Speaker 1]
Advantage. Hits. Who are you targeting?

The baler. Why do you have advantage? Reckless.

Oh. Alright, that hits. You're going to...

Stop! First of all, he's dead. Second of all, you're taking fire damage.

He's dead? Yes. He has one first.

Well, shit. He's dead, guys. Alright, this person takes my next attack.

Oh, wait, no. This is going to be... Hold on.

Oh. I'm 30 feet. Oh, shit.

[Speaker 8]
Dammit.

[Speaker 5]
When keeping it real goes wrong. I'm going to keep it real with you, Chief. I think I'm getting hit.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, Merrill made it!

[Speaker 5]
Going to keep it. Keep it 100.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, damn. Wait. What is this?

[Speaker 4]
This is only... With my nat 20, can I cover Mimosa with my giant body?

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I'm resistant to fire.

[Speaker 8]
It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
Ferris makes it. Alright, here's the damage.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so take half.

[Speaker 1]
Take half if you succeed. And then the monk and the monk and the rogue take half. Oh, thank god.

I was... Fuck. Bonus action.

Save me bonus action. Thank you. I want to heal.

Roll a hit dice. Melee people. I think it's just monk at this...

Wait, no. Monk used a ranged attack earlier. We haven't caught up.

It's their turn.

[Speaker 3]
Are you going to be fighting any spellcasters?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty sure all these guys are going to do spellcastery things. I'm not going to bother splitting them up. Okay.

Get everybody within... Let's see. Everybody within 15 feet of the Nalfeshnee.

[Speaker 3]
Where's this guy on the map?

[Speaker 1]
The pig dude.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I can't even see him. He can see you. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Have I missed anything?

[Speaker 1]
No. No, I don't think so. I don't think that you were in the explosion radius.

You're good.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Leaves Corpus and Mimosa. My turn's over. That is Corpus and Mimosa.

Make a saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
I know. I thought I had something that gave me advantage on wisdom. That's what I was looking for.

[Speaker 1]
You do get a bonus from being close to Meryl. Meryl's paladin.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's like a rogue feature that gave me it. But I can't find it quickly. It's fine.

Doesn't matter.

[Speaker 1]
Corpus is now frightened. Corpus is a bitch. Unbelievable.

That's his thing. The shadow demon is... Eh, we'll have him follow up later.

He actually doesn't have any spells. Here we go. Mimosa!

Go ahead and... Two things are gonna happen. One, you're gonna take 2d8 damage.

[Speaker 2]
Rude. I have resistance to fire damage.

[Speaker 7]
That sucks for him.

[Speaker 1]
You do need to make a con save or drop the item. Do not drop the item.

[Speaker 2]
I just pictured her dropping all of her daggers and it's just this loud, continuous clanging.

[Speaker 1]
Oh god! Here we go. This'll be nice.

I need Meryl, Corpus, Mimosa, and Karis to make me some wisdom saving throws. He has such a low DC.

[Speaker 4]
I'm scared.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, is this a spell?

[Speaker 1]
It is a spell.

[Speaker 3]
Can I use my this? Hold on.

[Speaker 1]
No, this.

[Speaker 3]
Can I capture it?

[Speaker 1]
You can copy the spell.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, nevermind. Fuck that then.

[Speaker 1]
You can still do it. It just doesn't get rid of the spell. It's just you now have a confusion spell, obviously.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'll take it. You knocked over my transform! Is this a charm effect?

[Speaker 1]
It is not.

[Speaker 3]
Let me do the wisdom saving throw first.

[Speaker 2]
It does have counter charm, but it's not a reaction, so.

[Speaker 5]
I can counterspell what spell slot do I have?

[Speaker 2]
Stop getting in there! Sorry.

[Speaker 5]
Fourth level. I have silvery barbs. Yeah, I'll counterspell it fourth level.

[Speaker 1]
I don't need to worry about that one. I will say that the other one casted so that we do not as well, so we don't have to worry about that. Everybody rolled already.

Everybody succeeded, so we don't have to worry about that.

[Speaker 3]
How does this work? Me stealing it? Copy the spell?

I don't exactly know what I'm doing. How many minstrel dice should I roll for this?

[Speaker 1]
You need to roll above a 14 total with your minstrel dice.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so roll like three of them. Four of them. Four of them.

What are they?

[Speaker 1]
D8s. You just rolled over. That's rough.

[Speaker 4]
Just barely failed.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I'll try again. And it's going to attack.

[Speaker 4]
Come at me, bro.

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna do it.

[Speaker 4]
Miss. What?

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a shield?

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Aha! That one hits.

[Speaker 1]
19 damage. We're gonna have this one go over and...

[Speaker 4]
Some healing would be nice. I'm at 25 of 130. I'm on it.

[Speaker 1]
Another confusion spell.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, Dex, please don't press my buttons.

[Speaker 4]
Same people. I'll have Tyrone counterspell it.

[Speaker 1]
Is he in line of sight to you? I don't think so. No, you can see him.

He just can't see you.

[Speaker 4]
Uh-huh. It says third level, but I have fourth level. It's mine.

[Speaker 1]
You're Warlock, I think it's like.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. My weirdness.

[Speaker 1]
No, I gotcha. Alright, so... I have to worry about that, and I think that's...

Oh, a shadow demon. Just gonna flip on over. Corpus, go ahead and make me a...

A what? Go ahead and make me a perception check. Wow, Corpus.

There's a five. What do I sense with a five? You sense nothing.

You don't even notice the attack that misses you. Alright, that's the end of that. I need folks to do a new initiative check.

Ha! I feel pretty good about this one.

[Speaker 3]
Somebody please get a 24.

[Speaker 2]
Can I silvery barbs that?

[Speaker 1]
Can who silvery barbs that?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's a question.

[Speaker 2]
It's an initiative. It's a check, right?

[Speaker 6]
I mean, Christopher Pinius is... I think he should have silvery barbs.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If he's in line of sight, then he can go for it.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Who's rolling the initiative?

[Speaker 1]
It's the shadow demon. I don't think he's like... Secure has a plus four.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he can see it. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
So my actual was a 15 then. I'll take that. Um...

Zekira can go.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
Somebody...

[Speaker 2]
Meryl. Me?

[Speaker 1]
Zekirals. Alright, I'll ready roll the 20. Range characters first, then melee, then spells.

[Speaker 2]
Meryl, you get advantage on the next attack.

[Speaker 6]
I am planning on healing.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I was going to say, can I lay on hands for myself? In public and everything!

[Speaker 5]
You need to pound melee first. Uh... I'm going to do some ranged attacks.

Uh... One of them is going to be a, uh... Booming Blade?

Oh, it has to be a melee weapon. I can't use that. Uh...

In that case, I'm just going to make two ranged attacks with my Heruidim pistol. Uh... Big guy's dead.

This cannon is still up right here?

[Speaker 1]
It's like... It's not a person.

[Speaker 5]
I see. Is this an ally? That's a friendly wolf.

Okay. In that case, I'm going to move over here. I'm going to target this guy with two attacks.

Hits.

[Speaker 1]
Also hits.

[Speaker 5]
And that's the turn. Alright, this is looking pretty bad.

[Speaker 1]
For other ranged people, Kyrona and Sekiro. What are these big things right here? They're big demons.

You can attack them to deal damage to their hit points. If you reduce their hit points to zero, they will die.

[Speaker 2]
I appreciate that. Um, we just started our next round, so...

[Speaker 4]
How long does it... No, let's not do that.

[Speaker 1]
Paris, you didn't cast anything on your last turn. If you would like to... Oh wait, did you?

I think I did. Yeah, so the Baelor.

[Speaker 3]
Um, do I... God, I don't know why my brain is mush, but do I go on Spellcaster or Ranged?

[Speaker 1]
If you're doing both, then you'll go on Spellcaster. Whichever one takes longer, basically.

[Speaker 5]
I'm never casting this fucking spell again.

[Speaker 4]
Let me know when I do. There we go, I'm targeting that guy.

[Speaker 1]
You'll be on the Spellcaster thing. Alright, the first... There's damage.

First hit will kill that trigger wall.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, have the second one hit the guy next to him then.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Am I missing... Am I missing anybody else for Ranged?

Okay, melee people.

[Speaker 4]
Hang on.

[Speaker 1]
May Rok attack. Rok is a companion. He may deal damage to somebody who has been hit with a melee attack within his range.

Or hit with an attack within his range. Actually, Corpus is frightened so he's going to use... Second attack hits.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, and I'm going to do another Divine Smite.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl's having a great time. She's like, usually I fight zombies, but demons are turning out to be fun too.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Meryl. Since you hit, I will hurt. And then...

I'm going to use all ten of these to deal 54 additional to this thing. With my wolf. Does the wolf have anything that gives it magical damage?

Um... No. Okay, so it will be half.

But it is still at least a chunk of its hit points. It's looking bloody. Nice.

And Corpus is going to use Patient Defense to heal up once more. Nothing to be said about that. Mimosa, you are a melee person.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Unless you were casting a spell at this ramp.

[Speaker 2]
Nope. Um...

[Speaker 6]
You see?

[Speaker 8]
I'm going to...

[Speaker 2]
Does the 20 hit?

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 2]
And then the sneak attack damage. And we'll have the sneak attack go to this guy. As well.

[Speaker 1]
There.

[Speaker 2]
And then... She's going to... I'm going to use that one for her bonus action.

Does the 19 hit?

[Speaker 1]
It's 18 AC.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I want to say she can get away without...

[Speaker 1]
If you use your bonus action you can disengage as a bonus action.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I already used my bonus action, so she's good. She stays.

[Speaker 1]
We have two attacks, plus your bonus action.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I... Uh... I did.

I attacked twice with... No? Did I not?

I thought I attacked... Yeah, I did. I attacked twice.

No, I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, you only attacked once. If you hit it a second time with, I think... Malbanon.

You can force him to run away. With the snake dagger. If you hit him with the snake dagger again, he...

[Speaker 5]
Does he have to slither away on his belly?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. But we'd be a bear.

[Speaker 5]
He has to do the worm.

[Speaker 2]
Unless he's dead.

[Speaker 1]
He's not dead, but he does have to provoke an attack of opportunity.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Hits. And you have your sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
It is dead.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, now she's dead. And then Monk, wherever he is. I guess...

Can he squeeze through people? Can he go, like, over here?

[Speaker 1]
He can go through the... Yeah, he can squeeze through a friendly creature, sure.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll attack that one.

[Speaker 1]
Hits.

[Speaker 2]
And he's dead. Cool. Um, that'll be his turn.

[Speaker 1]
Any other melee people? I don't believe so. Okay, that brings us to our spellcasters.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Speaker 4]
Someone please heal Meryl.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, give me a second.

[Speaker 4]
It's loading.

[Speaker 3]
Which of these enemies looks worse?

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Um, let me really quickly go through everyone's healing. So, can everyone see who I've got tar...

Oh my god, Audrey, please stop coughing. Can everyone see who I've got targeted or do I need to go through?

[Speaker 3]
I think you might need to go through.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Uh, Meryl. Corpus.

Mimosa. Charis. This guy, Orion.

And then myself.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my gosh, buddy, are you okay?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Ooh, topped us off. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, um... Everybody also gets Counter Charms. This one is?

So, until... I'm guessing my next turn you've got advantage on saving throws against Frightened or Charmed. I'm gonna need a long rest after this.

[Speaker 3]
It's so weird.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 3]
Let me do spells.

[Speaker 8]
It's a bit funky in here.

[Speaker 7]
I don't know what I was thinking about.

[Speaker 1]
I have not. I'm back.

[Speaker 3]
Welcome back. Uh... This dude needs to make a Wisdom save.

[Speaker 8]
Pretty good.

[Speaker 3]
I can't see him currently. But I'm gonna shoot him. Um...

[Speaker 1]
I'm just gonna move you up here for a moment. Oh, you still can't see him. What the fuck?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. He's blind or something. Somebody moved.

Somebody moved, and I didn't... I could see them, and then they moved. I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I wonder if it's... Can you see him now? Okay, it's me.

I have light.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So he's not looking so great. Also, you do still deal half damage, I think. Right?

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's bullshit. Why half damage?

[Speaker 2]
Does he succeed in...

[Speaker 1]
No, Dissonant Whispers. You still get to damage him.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You still get half damage.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. Looking pretty bad.

[Speaker 8]
Good.

[Speaker 1]
Any other spellcasters? I don't think so. I think all the spellcasters have gone.

So now we get to choose a new person to roll.

[Speaker 3]
Actually, hold on. Um... Orion never went.

[Speaker 1]
He did not.

[Speaker 3]
He's been a stupid guy. Can I just hit?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Was it Smoothbore? No, that needs to be reloaded. Hold on.

I'll do the other one. Why is the Heavy Rifle one charge? I'm confused.

Okay. Why does it have charge?

[Speaker 1]
Because I think we copied it off of... Iceberg.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. 16. Very good.

So just ignore the whole charge thing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's... No, it's not a resistant.

[Speaker 3]
It's got a... It's got a silencer? It's got a scope?

Wow. What is this damage resistance? What does that mean?

No idea.

[Speaker 1]
He also has a free casting of... It's not slate. It's a ritual casting of...

What does he have? I think the charges thing was for ammunition. In V11, ammunition was all fucked up.

Okay. He could do Rope Trick, and he could do Conjure Woodland Beings as a ritual.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Let's forget about it for now. For this next round, I need somebody to make me an initiative check. Somebody who hasn't gone yet.

[Speaker 4]
Do we want it to be terrible? Sure.

[Speaker 1]
It's my remaining Babel that will bring these guys up first. What's he going to use? He's going to use a Weakening Gaze on...

He can't save.

[Speaker 4]
Suck my dick.

[Speaker 1]
That's unfortunate. He's going to run up and he's going to attempt to attack. I'm going to attack him.

I missed.

[Speaker 8]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Being now fashioning, Kyle is also going to... I guess have spells. Wait, no, that went back to the Babel.

I do not want the Babel. Claw, claw, bite. Bite, claw, claw.

Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
36 damage.

[Speaker 2]
That's fucked up, man. Is it too late to Silver Rebar?

[Speaker 1]
No brave clerics to ruin my day. Can Dandelion... I don't believe that Christopher Pineas can see him.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
He's right here. Oh, was that not here?

[Speaker 1]
That was getting attacked. He was attacking Meryl.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Who's attacking?

[Speaker 2]
This big guy or the small guy?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you can't see him. It's the cannon that can't see him. No, you can Silver Rebar.

[Speaker 2]
Yay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that misses. It's dead.

[Speaker 2]
Purpose can have the advantage on the next attack.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
You have one hit. I'll take it. Dragoloth, meanwhile, is going to cast darkness.

Other Dragoloth is going to go away. Let's carve up the barbarian. Get a beef.

I rolled two ones. That's crazy. Okay.

Okay, alright. I got 18 damage. Wait, did you roll with advantage or disadvantage?

With advantage. I didn't reckless, and I used the dodge action. It doesn't matter because he can see you.

I used the dodge action. It was patient defense. Okay.

So it misses, I think. Yeah, that would miss. Okay.

Well, no, because the first roll was a natural 20. Oh, never mind. Okay, fuck you.

Take that damage. Oh. That's so mean.

I take half damage. Alright. I didn't use the...

Okay, I actually just have them both. It's so hot. If any of you have true sight, you may make attacks of opportunity.

[Speaker 3]
How high is the ceiling here?

[Speaker 1]
Not very high. Probably about 15 feet up. You have an easier time than most, being that you have...

You are tiny. Alright, that brings us to ranged people first.

[Speaker 2]
I'll have monk shoot. Because cloud of darkness.

[Speaker 6]
Can I make the argument for having a spell first? Go. I have a daylight.

[Speaker 1]
You do have a daylight.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, daylight versus darkness? That's amazing.

[Speaker 2]
I'm fine with that.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my good god.

[Speaker 8]
Wow.

[Speaker 2]
I see why you said that.

[Speaker 6]
Well, no, because it dispels the darkness.

[Speaker 4]
I didn't think it was going to be that big. What happened?

[Speaker 3]
That's daylight. Vampires allowed in here. Vampires.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, the funniest option is to cast that on Meryl. So that Meryl is a walking typewriter.

[Speaker 4]
Entirely valid. Go ahead and do it. That sounds awesome.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like she'd end up being a disco ball. Because of the armor. Blinding everyone.

Mhm.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so with that, you guys would be able to just call it this turn. I don't think I have anything else to really escape here. There is booty and treasure inside the back, the hole here.

It is also filled with several aether charges. Which are like little mines.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy, we're in a minefield.

[Speaker 1]
That are currently getting ready to detonate.

[Speaker 2]
Can I like rogue them to stop?

[Speaker 6]
Can I banish them?

[Speaker 2]
Or banish. That's fine. Can you spool or banish?

Or sleight of hand.

[Speaker 1]
There's going to be a skill challenge. There are 21 aether charges here.

[Speaker 3]
What happens if we just leave?

[Speaker 1]
That they blow up and the ship goes down. You guys will probably be okay.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I don't see a bad... I don't see anything bad coming out of that.

[Speaker 1]
You just miss out on the loot that's inside the...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we don't get the loot. And we don't get the ship if we want it.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, it's a creepy ship, but let's try and save the loot. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You have time.

[Speaker 4]
How long?

[Speaker 1]
That's a good question. Oh no. I'd give you guys...

It'll be three rounds max, but each time somebody fails, it's going to decrease the timer.

[Speaker 4]
How big are they?

[Speaker 1]
It's like a larger cannonball.

[Speaker 4]
Can I disarm them?

[Speaker 1]
You can disarm. That will disarm one.

[Speaker 4]
One?

[Speaker 1]
They have three rounds, and you have a lot of... Are they magical?

[Speaker 4]
I have an idea.

[Speaker 1]
They are magical.

[Speaker 4]
Can I dispel the magic?

[Speaker 1]
You can dispel magic for one. For one?

[Speaker 2]
Can she banish more than one? How many are there?

[Speaker 1]
Now there are twenty. One has been disarmed.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I gotta do a quick search. Okay.

I am going to summon giant owls with Conjure Animal. They are one quarter. Really?

Yeah, so I can summon eight of them. And I want these giant owls to swallow the bombs and fly away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so you got rid of how many bombs?

[Speaker 4]
I mean, there's eight of them. I figure between eight giant owls they can swallow all of the twenty bombs. They are not going to swallow them.

They can carry them. Okay. So we got...

That's going to be at least sixteen.

[Speaker 1]
No, they can carry one apiece.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Basketball bombing. Mimosa disabled one, and the owls are taking out one apiece.

[Speaker 3]
Can my Mage hand do it?

[Speaker 1]
Headbounds? No.

[Speaker 2]
I have Unseen Servant.

[Speaker 3]
Can I carry one by myself and have Orion do it as well?

[Speaker 2]
Unseen Servant will also help.

[Speaker 6]
I can cast a spell.

[Speaker 1]
You will not be able to carry it.

[Speaker 4]
How many are left?

[Speaker 1]
A lot. So you've gotten rid of nine. So now you are looking at...

It was twenty-one to start, so now you've got twelve.

[Speaker 3]
I have two hands. Can I grab two?

[Speaker 1]
No, they're heavy.

[Speaker 3]
Dammit. All right, fine. Charis will grab one, and Orion will grab one, and we will run.

[Speaker 1]
And Charis and Orion can together grab one.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. Wonderful. All right.

I'm going to disarm another one.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl is still giant. Can she start chucking them out of window?

[Speaker 1]
Make me an attack roll.

[Speaker 8]
Don't fail.

[Speaker 1]
Why am I still blurry? Get me off the blurry.

[Speaker 4]
Twenty-one.

[Speaker 1]
I will let you get rid of two of those, then. And Meryl casts it on one, so it gets rid of another one.

[Speaker 2]
And you said we have... Another one?

[Speaker 1]
I'm letting everybody cycle through before I go to the second action.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Because if one starts getting... If somebody messes up and one starts getting ready to explode, the most is probably going to be the go-to.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Why, Christopher Pineus, do you not have the ability to spell magic as well?

[Speaker 2]
No. Whoever built Christopher Pineus's magics didn't give him anything... I was going to say something useful, but didn't give him the spell magic.

[Speaker 6]
No, I did not. I thought I did.

[Speaker 2]
No, you didn't. He does have a feather fall. That's creatures.

Never mind. I thought about reduce. I can reduce one.

[Speaker 6]
Does anyone else want to give a shot at picking them up and chucking them?

[Speaker 1]
Corpus and Zekir could do it. Together, probably. The two of them could carry one out.

They'll do that. One more down.

[Speaker 5]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

[Speaker 1]
That's a count. There are seven left.

[Speaker 5]
We need to get them off because they're going to explode.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 5]
Can I summon cast Summon Elemental? And then...

[Speaker 2]
They're really heavy, so it's got to be strong.

[Speaker 1]
Elementals are strong. How long does it take to cast that spell? One action.

Okay. Conjure Elemental is the one that's... Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Elemental Spirit. And I guess I'll take water. Not a bad idea.

And I'll command it to dump these things off the boat. Now, probably.

[Speaker 1]
Strength is plus four. It could definitely carry one out. Okay.

Just another one down. I'm going to move on to round two. Six remaining.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Can Meryl toss another two?

[Speaker 1]
I need two attack rolls.

[Speaker 4]
I only have to make one attack roll.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but if I'm letting you get rid of two, I should have you make two attack rolls. Two opportunities for something to go wrong. What?

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, one of them kind of smacks into a harder part of the hull. It falls down with a noticeably shorter fuse. It does not feel so good.

[Speaker 2]
Can Monk take care of it? Can he pick it up and run away with it and toss it out?

[Speaker 5]
Two people can carry it out.

[Speaker 1]
Corpus Insecure will do it if they can. It's pretty unstable. Go ahead and make me some check to do this carefully.

[Speaker 4]
I have a question.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
If a spell takes a bonus action, can I cast it as an action and a bonus action in the same round?

[Speaker 1]
No. Spoke it, takes a bonus action, you can only cast it as a bonus action. Yeah, that makes sense.

Well, that did not go well.

[Speaker 6]
Can that be the one that I dispel magic on?

[Speaker 1]
Would you like to cast it again? I already did. I already marked off one for the dispel magic.

If you want to do another dispel magic, then it could be this one.

[Speaker 2]
Did you already mark down Mimis' Abuse tool check?

[Speaker 1]
Not her second one.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, can that be the one for the tricky one?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can rush over. Do you see Corpus and Zekira about to detonate?

[Speaker 2]
Oh goodness, okay, hang on, hang on. Just give me one moment. Alright.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, how many dispel magics have you counted me as casting?

[Speaker 4]
Just one.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I have done two.

[Speaker 4]
I will cast Teleport and send one, ideally one with a short fuse, to that crappy Living Island that we were on. I got rid of the one with the short fuse.

[Speaker 1]
So the Cloud Island is a different plane of existence from the Astral Tides?

[Speaker 4]
No, the Living Island.

[Speaker 1]
The Living Island was also in the Cloud Realms. That was not in the Astral Tides.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, how about the place where we met the Astral Devourer?

[Speaker 1]
You met him in the same plane of existence as Braccus.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god, I just teleported outside! I can look at it right now!

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make your roll.

[Speaker 3]
Can Charis and Orion get one again?

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
If I'm teleporting it somewhere that I can currently see...

[Speaker 1]
Do your familiarity with the... Very Familiar is a place that you can see when you cast the spell.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
They have a really good chance of not... 24. What is 24?

Off-target? Okay. That's alright.

Off-target it's still going to be...

[Speaker 4]
Instead of 120 feet, it's 100 feet away.

[Speaker 1]
It will rock the... You teleport it, and it rocks the boat! It's not supposed to do any damage.

But two of the mines are now rolling off to the side of the ship.

[Speaker 3]
And I... Once I get out there, fly down... How many turns do we have until these things explode?

[Speaker 1]
It explodes next round.

[Speaker 5]
Has anybody not acted this round? Uh... Lyrian and his...

Water Buddy haven't. Okay. So we'll each take one.

Water Buddy can get one.

[Speaker 1]
You can get one with another person.

[Speaker 6]
Has Monk done one since the round?

[Speaker 2]
Monk hasn't done one. Christopher can also cast Dimension Door.

[Speaker 6]
Monk and Lyrian can get one. There's only... Two?

How many are left?

[Speaker 1]
Two, yeah. So that's... You guys are good to go.

[Speaker 5]
I could also cast Dimension Door if I really needed to. Although these might not count as creatures, so that might not be kosher. But we got it figured out anyway, so it's academic.

Good job, guys!

[Speaker 1]
We should name this ship, if we got it.

[Speaker 5]
Call it the Indefatigable.

[Speaker 4]
Yes! The Unsinkable? No!

[Speaker 6]
The Ineffable.

[Speaker 2]
Indefatigable is good, because no one's going to be able to pronounce that.

[Speaker 5]
The Inamitable. That's from the Horatio Hornblower. Yes!

Oh my god, I can't believe anyone else knows that. I think we should call it Roop Hagonsword? We call it the Indy.

They call the ship the Indy. Hehehehe. Hehehehe.

[Speaker 1]
Hagonsword has already made an appearance in the Lancer game. Damn.

[Speaker 2]
We call it the... spaceship? Demon's Bane.

Demon's Bane, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Nethercutter.

[Speaker 3]
The Unexploded.

[Speaker 5]
P-U-X-B. The Wayfinder.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, in any case, I'm going to ditch the combat tracker.

[Speaker 5]
Woo! Good shit! Is that it for today?

I think I have to go soon. I do have to go. Yeah, you guys can head out.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to roll up the loot. You can also make it to Osrim Hub if you wish.

[Speaker 8]
Loot, loot, loot, loot.

[Speaker 1]
Loot, loot. Is it safe in Obrin Hub? Yeah, it is now.

That's the safe place you guys are going to. Alright, yeah, let's do it.

[Speaker 3]
We can long rest there?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and long rest just so I know, because I won't remember.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to cost money. 100 gold a night. So go ahead and...

It's not 100 gold a night, it's 100 gold a week.

[Speaker 5]
I'll pay for this.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. What are we... What's 100 gold?

[Speaker 5]
It's like... Accommodations.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we're not going to sleep on our bright new shiny ship?

[Speaker 5]
On the deck? Are you crazy? That will have a separate cost.

[Speaker 2]
Possibly a psychic one.

[Speaker 1]
No, it has a... It is not built for human accommodation, so you can still sleep on the deck and stuff like that.

[Speaker 4]
Would this thing fly in the atmosphere?

[Speaker 1]
So, Spelljammers, I think two of you have the rules from Astral, or have my copy of Astral Tides, and I might have also posted it inside... Westmarches? Where's Brilliant?

You're supposed to copy this link here. Also, you guys acquired a shield and sword from last Master Brilliant session.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, you wouldn't let us identify it, so I don't think anybody attuned to it.

[Speaker 1]
You have to meditate in order to attune to it. If you'd like to do some downtime in this place...

[Speaker 4]
You said that we have to attune to it in order to identify it, correct?

[Speaker 1]
No, you have to meditate with it to attune to it. Bar is asking... Bar is worried about it being cursed, and has correctly surmised that if you'd like to figure out if it is cursed, you'll only be able to do so by way of attuning to it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll link that for some other idiot.

[Speaker 3]
How much would a fancy room a week in one of the more fancier rooms be?

[Speaker 1]
That would be like 100 gold a night, but you would be living pretty high.

[Speaker 3]
Second fancy room?

[Speaker 1]
Second fancy? Sure, like 50 gold a night.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so how much is that for a week?

[Speaker 5]
50 times 7.

[Speaker 3]
I flunked out of school. I don't do math.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I can also... I can cast Layman's Tiny Hut if we really don't want to pay.

[Speaker 1]
You'll also be paying for birthing costs, but that's fine. Birthing isn't like docking the ship.

[Speaker 8]
It has nothing to do with me!

[Speaker 5]
E-R-D-H. E-R-D-H.

[Speaker 3]
Paris is gonna hang out in the fancier rooms, because um, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'ma throw a Hail Mary here. I would like to attune to the shield.

[Speaker 5]
Sure. Other than identify, are there other ways to learn the properties of items? Do you have to attune to them?

[Speaker 1]
Off the top of my head, I guess you could talk to a sage, and if it was within their realm of expertise, then they could give you more information.

[Speaker 5]
Because the sort of brilliance that says like, I identified it, but it has three unknown properties remaining. So by guessing, those were not, uh, were not revealed by the identify spell.

[Speaker 1]
Kinda nervous. What's this shield gonna do to me? And, let's see here.

Conveyance variety, conveyance, conveyance is another magical vehicle.

[Speaker 5]
I'll cast identify on both of the items. I think you already did. The sword and the shield that we got from this session, I haven't.

Oh. Did we get a sword and shield from this session? I thought that's what he said.

[Speaker 1]
Technically not, this, uh, it was from the astral devourer that you guys killed.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we got a shield and a sword. It was with the bag of holding.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. I might not have identified that. Corpus is gonna be cursed with a never ending need to eat.

[Speaker 1]
He's just gonna need to eat all the time. There's something about, so conveyances generally can't operate in material worlds by default, but like a bunch of them have a tag that indicates that they can be used in material worlds. This one does not have such a tag.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm gonna head off.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you have a good one. That was fun playing with you. I'll put down the fences and hostile environments.

Maybe that's it. Especially those with the realm.

[Speaker 3]
I think I'll head out too. Let me know when the loot and stuff has been posted. I will drop that in.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you guys for playing. Yep, thanks for running it. See you next time.

Bye bye. I just don't like this part. Oh.

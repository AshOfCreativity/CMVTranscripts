[Speaker 5]
Pretty isolated, I guess, is the way to say it. Well, there's the equine academy that's the closest. Would you like to walk...

I don't want to have my airship go missing for weeks, basically. Did you drop us off? Could we have someone drop us off?

I think Jesse, if you pay him like 300 gold or something, he'll teleport everyone to the equine academy, and hopefully we don't get roped into horse shenanigans and we can just fly and he'll drop you off and probably just go home and come back in a couple weeks.

[Speaker 3]
I suppose 300 I could do. That'd be half my money, but I could do it.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a reliable way of getting contact for a return trip?

[Speaker 5]
If you walk back... Oh, sending works, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Do we have sending?

[Speaker 5]
I do.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 4]
It's part of Aberrant Mind, like bonus spells.

[Speaker 2]
And that's the range and everything? I'm not familiar with the spell, but you're sure that works?

[Speaker 4]
It's got enough range.

[Speaker 5]
The range is interplanar. Okay, we'll make sure.

[Speaker 1]
If there are different planes of existence, there's a 5% chance of it failing.

[Speaker 2]
Otherwise... So you have to catch you while you're not high.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
So the travel plan is teleport to equine place, pile into the aircraft, travel in to within a certain distance that we haven't figured on yet, and then walk the rest of the way.

[Speaker 3]
At that point, do we need the...

[Speaker 1]
I was going to cut everybody off for a moment. Jesse, you're going to receive a reply from the diplomacy pouch thing. Sorry, but we don't recognize you as a current student.

If you're looking to take some winter semesters, we hear the season is fast approaching.

[Speaker 5]
Pull the hose from those fuckers!

[Speaker 2]
Did you lose your student ID card? Oh no!

[Speaker 5]
Fine, Jesse will just fly you the whole goddamn way and he looks pissed off the entire time. How much does it cost to pay a wizard to cast teleportation circle every day for like, three weeks?

[Speaker 2]
Isn't it a year to get a teleportation circle? It is a year, but he's been doing it.

[Speaker 1]
I will figure out someone.

[Speaker 6]
For now, we just have to get there.

[Speaker 2]
And we still want, um... We still want to go in on foot, incognito if possible.

[Speaker 3]
We want to just look like hired help, um, and uh...

[Speaker 2]
Okay, no, no flashy, flashy airship entrance.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm gonna have to dress in rags. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There is a, there's a road that stretches from the... Yeah, from the west here to the east. Basically, there is a small town beside one of these lakes here.

Yeah, in between the Aquan Academy and this spot, there's a river that runs down all the way down through some aid, basically the Mississippi of this region. And there's a road that stretches from this area to, you know, all the way over to the end of the world routes where the excavation site is going on.

[Speaker 2]
Oh okay, so we could go like straight south and then take the road east, potentially, because this lake here, the water tiles here are like pretty much due south.

[Speaker 1]
So there's a few, yeah, there's basically a few different like villages and such, hunting parties between the, uh, you know, planesmen, homesteaders, whatever have you, and the hexes between.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, how far away do we want to go from this place? Because if we want to be not in eyeshot, I don't know how...

[Speaker 3]
Well, we have the mountains to our advantage. We have the mountains to our advantage. We could park maybe behind the mountains and then walk the rest of the way.

That'd be easy.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Because I think these are planes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they are planes. Normally it's like six miles. No, no, I think it's like three miles to the horizon.

Is it that what you can see? I'd say it's about three miles to the horizon is what you can actually see. And on the ground, yeah, something is raised up, and that's going to give you a little bit more.

But if you approach from behind the hills here, then you'll be able to land and travel south.

[Speaker 2]
So maybe like as close as this hex we could do safely under the cover of the terrain?

[Speaker 1]
I would draw out a measurement going down to that hex. I might see which one you're looking at.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
This reminds me of there's some people here who are exploring.

[Speaker 6]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's about 70 miles to the west.

[Speaker 1]
Do you hear that in the background? Yeah. It's entertaining.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you can hear that in the background?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. It's entertaining. It's a good thing I'm bringing a tent along.

[Speaker 3]
Who is Slade, and why do I have control over them? I'm not complaining, but who are they? That's a great question.

[Speaker 1]
I think Slade actually, I thought, belonged to a different person. I can't remember.

[Speaker 6]
God, I thought you said Slave.

[Speaker 3]
I ain't got one of those.

[Speaker 2]
Not yet. There's still time. There's still time.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to switch to Axe 2.

[Speaker 6]
You did not hear that, but I did.

[Speaker 2]
I was not expecting that. Denying slavery.

[Speaker 1]
Because I was waiting to give XP until I kicked Reset, was the idea. So where did I put that? Oh, I didn't put that there.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
We have... So if I'm looking directly at the Gate of the World Roots, and I'm just looking at the hexes that are perfectly aligned with it to the west, so he's sort of like skipping over a row. The second row to the left, that kind of top swamp marshy tile, is that a good place to land?

[Speaker 3]
Right here, because we will have at least a little bit more cover from this mountain here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we want to keep at least a fraction of a mountain square between us and that. Okay. All right.

So this will be our target hex.

[Speaker 3]
What kind of terrain is that? It's just a little rocky area?

[Speaker 2]
It looks like mushrooms, I'm going to say. Or like those pills from Dr. Mario?

[Speaker 4]
I can't think of enough to name that. It's kind of like gravelly. Looks kind of gravelly.

[Speaker 3]
Does look gravelly.

[Speaker 2]
It's a big rock candy mountain.

[Speaker 3]
Candy mountain!

[Speaker 4]
It's probably some rough terrain.

[Speaker 3]
Luckily I fly.

[Speaker 2]
Luckily I'm a wood elf. Ciao! Difficult terrain?

More like, not difficult terrain. It didn't land, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Celestial revelation intensifies.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so we have our target hex. We need to figure out our days of travel. Because we're probably not going to be able to forage in the sky.

These are 20 mile hexes.

[Speaker 1]
24.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, a huge benefit of this was I was looking forward to, you know, harvesting some herbs. Oh, I see what you're saying.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there's one clarification that needs to be made here. So the Dreaming Vessel can only be flown at night, or between the hours of dusk and then dawn. Meaning it can't land.

Unless it's being flown in the woad. So chances are you would basically be making camp each night. You would just be progressing faster throughout the day.

Or wait, no, you would make camp during the day, Andy would.

[Speaker 3]
Which means you can collect supplies during the day.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you for clarifying. That all came in handy.

[Speaker 3]
You can collect supplies during the day and fly during the night.

[Speaker 1]
I was about to say, I guess technically you could. I don't know. The way you guys want to handle your sleep cycles and stuff like that is up to you.

[Speaker 2]
And then in terms of rest, how do we get HP back?

[Speaker 5]
Hit die per day.

[Speaker 2]
Hit die per day of rest. And how often do we regenerate our hit die?

[Speaker 1]
You could spend as many hit dies as you like on a short or long rest. You regenerate one hit die per day. Unless you're staying in town or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, can we... I'm assuming we've been sleeping in the keep. So I'm assuming we're back to full hit points?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, at this point.

[Speaker 2]
It's been a couple weeks by now.

[Speaker 4]
Just kind of grabbing that from the exploration document. Mood. My single calendar.

[Speaker 2]
On these sheets, is there an easy way to add or subtract to your current hit points? Because when I click on the hit point bar, it wants me to directly edit the number.

[Speaker 1]
At this point I would just click long rest.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Take long rest. Which in 5th edition doesn't have...

[Speaker 2]
It gets the effect.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it gets the effect.

[Speaker 2]
At this point you're good. Because it's designed for weaklings. They don't have the strong man variance.

[Speaker 4]
D&D 5e long rest. I nearly got completely murdered by a lich. I have had my arm be grazing against the most sharpest greatswords in all the land.

I take a little sleep, and I am perfectly fine.

[Speaker 2]
I took 13 points of con damage, but I slept for 8 hours.

[Speaker 1]
You will find it more difficult to recover hit points while napping tomorrow. But besides that...

[Speaker 6]
I got my arm cut off, but I slept for 8 hours.

[Speaker 2]
And I grew back.

[Speaker 1]
I am not losing limb. You lose whatever the dice tell you to lose.

[Speaker 2]
So how should we calculate our expected rations? Because we're going to be there for weeks. We're probably not going to bring enough rations to survive on rations the whole time.

[Speaker 3]
Because we're probably going to pull out and camp. If we go in as hired help, they probably have food. Because it's not wise to let your men starve.

Yeah, that's kind of the point.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So they probably have a holiday inn there. Or a company store.

If you really need food, I can bring a fuckton. Well, I just want to not starve. The goal here is just to bring enough to not starve.

I'm bringing 40 additional rations. Oh my god. Well, I can pay for my own food, sir.

Speaking of rations, I have an entire bag of holding to help carry all that. 249 gold. I can buy rations for days.

Weeks, months even. And do we have to worry... I'm not sure about wilderness traveling.

Do we need to worry about getting lost? Okay. Because I have a cartographer's tools proficiency.

So I can map well.

[Speaker 5]
The encounters that you get while traveling is represented by the traveling checks that you'll make as part of the exploration. So you might get lost or you might encounter something if you fail those. You can see in the Chillmist Valley PDFs in the journal entry section is the...

I think it's exploration? Hmm. That has how to go about that.

[Speaker 1]
Goddammit, I was muted. Okay, the biggest thing waiting for you guys to confirm right now is basically just how many days it's going to take you to get over there. So it would be about...

You would be traveling about 4 miles per hour over the... Yeah, with the airship. And you would have 11 hours per day.

The hours of dawn and dusk.

[Speaker 2]
So if we drove in shifts we could drive the whole time?

[Speaker 1]
Couldn't because remember it doesn't actually...

[Speaker 2]
The full 11 hours, I mean. We wouldn't have to stop and have everyone rest at the same time.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it's basically controlled by a set of... It's not quite unseen servant, it's more like unseen sailor, but it's mostly self-piloting.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, cool, cool, cool. Okay, so we don't have to worry about shifts then. But maybe to avoid getting surprised for encounters.

So that's 4 miles an hour, 11 hours a day, 44 miles a day.

[Speaker 1]
And then you guys are planning on dropping off where? Just draw a thing to that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we're going to divert. We're not going to go straight towards there. We want to avoid them being able to see us or parking.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure if you can see the thing I'm drawing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm measuring distance to that.

[Speaker 3]
But you have to draw from Wolfclaw keeps on it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see. Whenever I try to do that, it shoots me to the south very, very quickly.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I have to zoom. That's why I use the measurement controls one instead of the ruler. What's my zoom?

Oh, god damn it.

[Speaker 3]
What happened?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
All right, I'm giving up.

[Speaker 1]
I'll figure out how long that is. Distance in miles is 691.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So. 691 divided by 44 is 15.7 days. So 16 days. All right.

[Speaker 4]
I can very easily pretend to just be hired.

[Speaker 3]
I think I'll have to hide my wings. And does anyone have a cloak I could borrow?

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm sure the quarter. I'm sure you could buy one for like five gold.

[Speaker 4]
I just realized I also have photographer's tools.

[Speaker 3]
I think I have disguise kit and whatnot.

[Speaker 2]
I. I can disguise myself. Yeah, I have alter self, but I don't think I can use that.

[Speaker 3]
And I have clothes and costume. So I have a couple of costumes. So, yeah, I think I'll be good.

[Speaker 6]
I think we're ready.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, indeed. Well, on to the breach.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So. You guys have locked in your decision here.

We're going to be going. We're going to spend 15 days flying 44 miles a day. I might get a little fucked up.

Nah, you could make it. You would spend a little bit of time in Bronloch, flying down from Wolfclaw Keep, or just make a small detour there so you did not get stranded in the water. And that would be.

Yeah, that would be difficult.

[Speaker 2]
I've got 10 days of rations. We're going to be traveling for 16. Although I guess we can still, we're going to be stopping to forage along the way.

So hopefully. We don't run out. I think I've double that, actually.

There's the rations cost.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I have about 10 days worth of rations as well.

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and start making me some. There we go. Skill checks here.

[Speaker 3]
What kind?

[Speaker 1]
The kind used.

[Speaker 6]
Exploration.

[Speaker 1]
Exploration.

[Speaker 6]
All right. I will be a camper.

[Speaker 3]
Let me look at my. I think I'm pretty much only good as the entertainer. And then Kibi can be a tracker or survivalist of some kind.

[Speaker 2]
I have my assistant is a tracker.

[Speaker 3]
OK, so.

[Speaker 5]
Jesse, you'll help if you need it, but it sounds like you have enough people to cover it all.

[Speaker 1]
Traveling for 15 days.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Entertainer then.

[Speaker 3]
We have. I don't see why we couldn't have more than one entertainer. More the merrier, you know?

[Speaker 6]
Nat 20 is crazy. First role. They know the character.

[Speaker 3]
Class effect. Bard. All right.

On a hearty rest, each creature gains one use of bardic inspiration. If I can succeed at this role.

[Speaker 4]
Where is that check?

[Speaker 2]
So with our hirelings, do we make a single check? Like our hireling is always like part of us, like it's part of our PC for your guy.

[Speaker 1]
I think you're specifically as a tracker, so he would just be based in the DC would be able to succeed on this. It's relative. OK, 16.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I think he succeeds on anything that's less than 20. I can be the survivalist.

I'm proficient in it. Although I only have a plus five.

[Speaker 4]
That'd be my performance check.

[Speaker 6]
And then we would also roll maybe foraging.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's the survivalist or the hunter. Oh, it's split across. There's like a cook, a fisher, a hunter.

[Speaker 8]
I don't think there's like a forager.

[Speaker 6]
No, I mean like for secondary class features foraging. Like rolling a D10, a D8, like to get an herb.

[Speaker 8]
What about it?

[Speaker 6]
Since we are traveling. Oh, no, I've just explained it.

[Speaker 1]
Is there anybody else who isn't a blister?

[Speaker 4]
Scholar, unfortunately.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm a crafter. That'll be six days.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. Charismatic display. Is anyone doing Vanguard?

Because we do need someone keeping out. Watch. Charis and or Kibi can do both of those.

Although, yeah, both of them have good perception. A plus five is, you know, OK, perception. It's not bad perception, but.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, I did roll on that 20 on my camping skill, so maybe.

[Speaker 3]
All right. So I will be. Let's see.

I think Charis will do. What is.

[Speaker 2]
Here's my survival check.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi is going to do. Kibi is going to do Vanguard, which will be. What is that check?

Is that just a. Perception, I suppose.

[Speaker 1]
So it's whatever you can justify to me, but usually it's going to be. Oh, all right. I wish I had my old tables for the.

I don't have my tables from the old West marches. I wish I still did, which I think only Landy has experienced and the many times that have resulted in women getting rescued from barrels up in the sky.

[Speaker 3]
Damsels in distress.

[Speaker 4]
Literally, I just now remembered about the fact that I have the bottle of boundless coffee.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Landley, Landy, you miss the best possible fucking.

[Speaker 5]
I'm so sad.

[Speaker 1]
I was just talking about how I like I can't find my old. I had two of a very specific journal from Wyvern Games or Wyvern Journals or something like that. And I had in one of those journals was my aerial encounter tables for the old West marches because we were playing and doing so many airships back then.

I don't have it anymore. I was just telling them about how many. I think you're the only person here who got to experience it.

And the many, many, many times that we encountered women in barrels.

[Speaker 5]
How you find a wife.

[Speaker 1]
How you find a wife. Random encounter table.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you, James, for the blue alien wife.

[Speaker 1]
Always.

[Speaker 6]
We actually rolled pretty well.

[Speaker 1]
We did. Good, good, good. Okay, so the first, how many days is that?

One, two, three, four, five. And then the tracker would make it six.

[Speaker 6]
I roll for an herb.

[Speaker 1]
I guess it would make six days for six days. Nothing goes. Nothing happens.

[Speaker 2]
Good. We just have a 10 day left. All right.

And we're marking off our rations for this. Right.

[Speaker 6]
I'm dividing my rations among the party. It will be fine. All right.

So you're covering the rations.

[Speaker 1]
Which is how many people?

[Speaker 2]
Well, second Hall F is two. I mean, how many PCs do we have? One, two, three, four, five PCs, each with a hireling.

So 10.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I have a hireling.

[Speaker 2]
In a day. In a day. I don't think I ever bothered.

[Speaker 4]
Nine.

[Speaker 2]
Nine, since one of the PCs doesn't have a hireling. Right.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to pull up the forest encounter chart and pull off the closest. Now, I guess. I have silver.

[Speaker 2]
So 10 would be five gold. All right.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Where do I find the herbs?

[Speaker 1]
Why is this so fucking huge?

[Speaker 3]
That's what she said.

[Speaker 2]
It's terrible. Terrible.

[Speaker 3]
It's low-hanging fruit. But, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Very low-hanging, apparently.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So, well, this one's going to be easiest, I guess, to work with. Because the weather becomes magical.

The first part is I'm going to have somebody make a navigation, some check to navigate. If you succeed, you're going to be. If you succeed, you're going to be blown faster along your destination here.

If you fail, you'll be blown off course and likely lost.

[Speaker 3]
Well, who's got the best perception?

[Speaker 1]
I said check to navigate.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We do have a navigator.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
I just have cryptographer's tools.

[Speaker 2]
That would absolutely.

[Speaker 4]
That would absolutely apply to this. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Can I assist?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, because you both have proficiency.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
All right. I'll use a little bit of my scholar dice for this as well. 2d6 of it.

Okay. All right. So advantage.

Yep. We're fine.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 4]
We are perfectly fine.

[Speaker 1]
You guys get an extra two days of that one day. Guys get an additional three days of progress.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
You get additional. In that one day, you get an additional day of progress. But for as long as that weather lasts, you will be able to continue taking advantage.

Good. So those two run seven days. We did six.

That was day seven. And you got two days worth of travel in that one. Seven.

[Speaker 6]
Nice. Seven days left. And I would roll again.

[Speaker 3]
We rolling exploration again? Nope. Okay.

Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
All right. So for this one, you guys are just going to come across a flower growing in the clouds here. It's not that strange of an aggravation for those of you who have ever been on their ship before.

But that's probably. So it is odd when somebody leans over the, you know, kind of leans over the railing of the ship and they see something leaning and they get this little metallic flower.

[Speaker 3]
What's it smell like?

[Speaker 1]
It smells like aluminum. And bananas.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm not touching it. I'm not getting stung by any bees. Sky bees.

[Speaker 1]
Up here, the insect of choice that likes to infest clouds is termites.

[Speaker 3]
It's awful.

[Speaker 1]
How do you think they get so porous?

[Speaker 3]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Water vapor. In eight days, you made ten days of progress. Natural terrain.

What would a patch of impassable natural terrain be in the clouds? It would be a change of weather and a storm. So somebody go ahead and make a check to navigate here.

[Speaker 4]
Looks like I'll do it again.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on. I have a lyre that can change the weather. Yes, you do.

Actually, it's a harp. No, it's the lute that I have attuned. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you would just be able to use that to basically forge a path under your current weather conditions. Perfect. Twelve days of progress.

In nine days.

[Speaker 3]
We're on track.

[Speaker 4]
Making good time.

[Speaker 3]
Karis gets increasingly more nervous as the days pass. I'm not touching these flowers.

[Speaker 6]
Could I identify it? I want to figure out what it is.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, how?

[Speaker 6]
Maybe a nature check?

[Speaker 4]
Or arcana.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, nature or arcana would work. Well, it's alakazam, it looks like.

Kind of reminds you of... Shoot, what are those plants that everybody has around Christmas time? They have red petals, but they're not actually petals.

[Speaker 2]
Poinsettias?

[Speaker 1]
Christmas cactus? Poinsettias. It's reminiscent of a poinsettia.

[Speaker 2]
There must be grandmas nearby. If possible, I'd like to potentially harvest it.

[Speaker 6]
Put it in my pocket.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's presumably... I assume that you guys did that with both of these.

[Speaker 4]
I'll take one, you take the other? Yep.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not in debt with the alchemist anymore, so I think I'm good. You guys can keep them.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is the same for pretty much every single table.

[Speaker 2]
How are we doing on rations?

[Speaker 6]
I'm pretty much out, so we should probably... I mean, I think that it lasted.

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean you think?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it was like a hundred rations. It was nine rations a day, yeah. So that was enough for nine days.

No, ten days.

[Speaker 1]
Right, and this is day ten.

[Speaker 2]
So we're through your rations. Can we forage?

[Speaker 3]
Heavey wants to go hunting. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
However... I don't know if anybody saw the result that I just got here. Go ahead and chill out for a few minutes here.

Or look through your inventories, your character sheets.

[Speaker 2]
I've got 20 rations, so if need be... I can carry us another two days on my rations.

[Speaker 3]
If we make it another two days. CR 15?

[Speaker 1]
15+. Phineas, do you know where the fucking... Is there an aerial encounter chart in AD&D?

Or is there just water and all that other shit? I could have sworn that there was an aerial encounter chart.

[Speaker 2]
I thought there was an aerial encounter chart with all the weird aerial encounter rules. Like all the weird movement rules. I thought there was.

I'll see if I can pull out my DMG.

[Speaker 1]
If you can do that, that would be perfect. I'm going to grab the... And I really appreciate it.

I'm going to grab the map that I used last time for the Dreaming Vessel. Allow everybody to get on top of it. It's been way too long since we've had an airship combat.

Does anybody... Oh, Jesse, what kind of flying mount... Lady, what kind of flying mount did Jesse have?

He has a Pegasus. A Pegasus. You are free to have that on board with you, if you so please.

[Speaker 5]
How smart are Pegasus? They're smart enough that I don't need to cast Awaken on it. Or is it...

Is it unintelligent? Do I need to... Do I need to have cast...

[Speaker 1]
You would be able to have it go in the same turn as you, but like not... You would not have to use your action to command it.

[Speaker 5]
I was just thinking Jesse had cast Awaken on it, so he has a friend. Oh, I see. He's just a lonely guy that casts Teleportation Circle every day at the Keep.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not in the Aerial Encounter... There's no tables in the Aerial Encounter rules. But there are a bunch of creature-based things about maneuverability and stuff like that.

[Speaker 3]
You could just Google one.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll see if Google Foo brings up a good, useful table.

[Speaker 3]
I saw some tables. I did Google it. But I wasn't sure if you were looking for something specific.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there's a Dragon's Foot.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just looking through Plutonium to see if I can grab the Apparent Spirit. Because Summon Apparition is a very useful thing.

[Speaker 2]
Monstrous Compendium Annual 2.

[Speaker 1]
If it was in connection to the server here, that's really...

[Speaker 5]
Man, if Jesse dies doing an Asgore, I'm gonna be actually sad about this.

[Speaker 3]
I'm terrified that because I initiated this quest, everyone is going to die. I'm terrified. I'm sorry in advance.

[Speaker 5]
He's not even the character I wanted to play this session with.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no. Though you did make a pretty smart choice, putting somebody by the...

[Speaker 5]
Well, you'll die here the rest of the session. It's just my character who started there.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and place yourselves on the center of the map there. And then you can move yourselves around.

[Speaker 5]
What can my Pegasus do? Challenge Rating 2 Creature. I don't think the Pegasus is going to fight.

[Speaker 2]
I link you to the... How do I... To an archive PDF of the Monstrous Compendium.

There's a table on page 121.

[Speaker 1]
I'm really surprised that there's not one inside of the AD&D Dunmer Masters Guide. That is genuinely shocking to me.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I don't know...

[Speaker 8]
Why do I feel like I'm big?

[Speaker 5]
Ah fuck, I never made up Jesse's Guns and Foundry.

[Speaker 4]
Something tells me that the Apparent Spirit, the flying plus can be very useful here.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, anybody with the capacity to fly here is probably going to have a little bit of an easier time.

[Speaker 3]
Yes! Except for I'm not a martial... Not a martial type.

[Speaker 1]
You have a gun and you have a bunch of...

[Speaker 3]
I do have a gun. And I have Dexterity. We're good.

[Speaker 2]
I have Misty Step. So I've got that coming for me. I can try and jump.

[Speaker 1]
You don't even have to wait for the encounter to start.

[Speaker 2]
I jump real good. I got some strong legs.

[Speaker 1]
Page 121. And... Hey, there it is.

Okay. Where do we just plop ourselves down? Excuse me.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. I don't think it's cross-referenced by CR. No, it's fine.

Or by Hittite.

[Speaker 1]
I just had to roll it a bunch of times to then see what would... You know, if anything decent would come up.

[Speaker 8]
Filter through, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Hmm. I could be a real fuck-ass here.

Okay, so I'm going to start off by... I don't know why Edmund is so big. So fix it.

[Speaker 3]
If you, like, right-click your character and hit the settings button, you can go to Appearances and scale down your character to, like, one. Which I need to do.

[Speaker 2]
Should we drag our token on?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and drag your token on here. Oh, wrong character.

Hold on. Gooby's big.

[Speaker 2]
Can we get some Final Fantasy boss music? That'd be really good.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Specifically, you can get...

[Speaker 1]
Nope, that one's not it. Excellent. Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to start off with a few checks for everybody here. Currently, the ship is getting battered from all sides by this tailwind that's been a huge boon to you folks so far. Has just started changing direction randomly and throwing you from side to side.

Basically, you've never seen a boat fishtail, but that's what it feels like.

[Speaker 3]
Are there any poles anywhere? Like, holding up things? You know, that I can latch onto with my claws?

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! I've got rope, so can I use my mage hand to tie one end around myself and mage hand to tie one end around a mast or something like that as a lifeline?

[Speaker 3]
That'll work. Charis is just going to try to balance it in the air.

[Speaker 2]
I can land. Aim for the bushes.

[Speaker 1]
Terrible. Terrible. Alright, first check is going to be for somebody to control the vessel and try to steady it.

Which would be? Otherwise, it's going to roll.

[Speaker 2]
I think we had a cartographer nerd, right?

[Speaker 1]
We did have a cartographer nerd. This would either be a tool, arcana, because it is technically magical, or a strength check.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'll do that.

[Speaker 6]
I will handle the strength.

[Speaker 4]
I'll handle the arcana.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I think it's an ore, so...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Never mind then.

[Speaker 6]
By strength, do you mean athletics or strength? Just strength?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, every single time that I tell you this, it is the exact same.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
You have a proficiency that's relevant to a strength check.

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Repeat that?

[Speaker 1]
Would you like to suggest one?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, yes, because athletics would be a...

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
A skillful appliance of strength.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be fine. I need something.

[Speaker 2]
We have a new Montoya with us. That's incredible. I always wondered what happened there.

What he got to after he, uh... After he got revenge for his father.

[Speaker 5]
He became a sky pirate. This is what he does now. He's not actually in a go.

He's just a big fan of the Princess Bride.

[Speaker 2]
He's like, surgically altered. He's just cosplaying. Pretty much, yeah.

He's like an obsessed Mandy Patinkin fan. Does Mandy Patinkin exist in this world?

[Speaker 1]
You're a playwright somewhere. Gonna have to be this one? Okay.

I never heard the results of that skill check, by the way.

[Speaker 6]
Seventeen.

[Speaker 1]
Seventeen? You have a partial success here. You have succeeded in preventing the boat from kind of rolling over.

Literally. But it's still listing heavily to one side. Everybody has been knocked prone.

Who is the vanguard?

[Speaker 3]
Kibi.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi. Alright. You had a successful check.

So what is the effect that takes place when you see an encounter?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Barbarian...

[Speaker 1]
It is...

[Speaker 3]
If the Barbarian successfully detects a hazard or threat before it harms the party, the party gains resistance to the first damage dealt by it. If the hazard is a combat encounter, they gain resistance to damage the first round instead.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Meanwhile, I did an earlier check.

[Speaker 1]
I can't... You're cutting in and out right now. Oh, okay.

Is it kind of like... Robot? No, it sounds like your sensitivity is going up and down, and your sentences aren't surpassing the sensitivity threshold.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Okay, try again, though? Yeah.

I'll just put the... This is my thing as an entertainer, as a sorcerer.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Earlier, I got a... 16, I believe? Just fucking work.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Check. Okay, Kibi, you see a dark shape passing the clouds.

It is... roughly... I'm going to do a size comparison.

End-to-end, it's probably about a tenth or maybe a fifth of the length of the... ...of the vessel.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what that means, but...

[Speaker 1]
Stretching all the way out. It has a vaguely serpentine form and clearly has wings. I see a little bit of lightning flash in the clouds.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should just go down with the ship. Just, like, point it towards the ground. Just not let it deal with this thing.

Just die quicker.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead. Everybody add yourselves to the initiative counter here. I will give you one round to prepare yourselves.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
This could be either buffing yourself, doing something else. It could be diplomacy, taking potions.

[Speaker 4]
Whatever you choose is not that much of a concern to me. Alright. I'll, uh...

I'll use... You cut out again. I'll use four sorcery points to cast Summon Aberration without the material components.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to cast Heroism. Well, let me read it first.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm just going to... I'm going to fix the sensitivity real quick. That's fine.

[Speaker 6]
There is no combat encounter in your current view scene.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to do third level Heroism because I think that makes it so I can cast it on three people.

[Speaker 5]
How far away is the Serpentarii?

[Speaker 1]
Is this better now? Yep, this is better now. Yeah, it's fine.

Currently it's flying around the ship. I'm going to say about passes somewhere between 50 to 100 feet. It's kind of hard to tell with the ship listing as it is.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Is there enough visibility that we can... Maybe it's behind the clouds sometimes and not others, but how clear visibility do we have?

If I wanted to take a shot at this thing, do I think I'd be able to hit it?

[Speaker 1]
If you made an attack right now, it would be disadvantaged because you don't have a clear shot on it. And it keeps going either behind the clouds or here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so there is concealment.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, some degree of concealment. Got it.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just giving you guys a turn to do whatever you'd like to change the ship or do something else.

[Speaker 3]
What's everybody's HP max?

[Speaker 2]
59.

[Speaker 3]
59?

[Speaker 2]
55.

[Speaker 3]
55. Okay, I have three heroism. I'm going to do myself and two others.

I'm going to leave Kibi out of it because she's got rage.

[Speaker 5]
Seems like Edmund also has rage.

[Speaker 2]
I have an action for Silk to take. Which is to draw icebite and gaze through the scope and scan around for any invisible creatures in the sky.

[Speaker 3]
Jesse, Silk, you guys get heroism.

[Speaker 2]
What is that effect and do I note it?

[Speaker 3]
Jesse and Silk?

[Speaker 1]
It's Jesse and Silk and then I thought it targeted three people. And then Charis as well.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, where's my rage?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, heroism, cool. There you go.

[Speaker 3]
You gain temporary hit points equal to my spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each turn. Which is...

[Speaker 5]
how do I check that on this thing?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, right here.

[Speaker 5]
I'll top you the spell entry. So that's a plus five.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, always ping that in chat.

[Speaker 3]
So that means I get five extra HP?

[Speaker 1]
Five temporary hit points at the start of each turn. Or you could only have temp HP from one source, but if that gets diminished in any way, then that's going to...

[Speaker 4]
That's weird. This spirit is the same initiative as me, just goes right after. Alright, that's fine.

So is it not as... the input's better now? For everybody?

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
And if you guys could go through and turn names on your tokens, it would help me. Because it's kind of hard to see the... match up the players to the colors to the tokens.

[Speaker 4]
There we go, I just turned mine on.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Charis. At the start of your turn, you hear... go ahead and make me a perception check.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, perception... How'd I do?

[Speaker 1]
You hear the beating of wings from the side that is listing. So basically, right now the ship is on an angle. The right side of the ship is lower than the left side is.

[Speaker 3]
And you hear the sound of wings coming from the left. I'm going to shoot it.

[Speaker 8]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it's set up correctly, so it's... I'll do it manually. I guess that's just a d20.

Plus my dex.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. 20 plus dex plus your proficiency. Just roll a d20 and then we can add your...

[Speaker 3]
Did I do that right?

[Speaker 8]
Nope, okay.

[Speaker 3]
What is it? Slash R? Yeah, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's definitely gonna hit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. And then it's a 3d10 radiant damage. 3d10.

Nice.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
We'll apply that damage. Anything with your bonus action or other parts of your turn here?

[Speaker 3]
No. I think I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
By the way, so I rolled a reaction roll a moment ago, which was a 67. Reaction rolls are for... there we go.

Reaction rolls are for people to basically check to see whether or not they like you and such. Would you like to force... Your gun gives you the capacity to force a re-roll of this check.

[Speaker 8]
Then absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
Initial one is 67.

[Speaker 2]
Which end is more friendly, higher or lower?

[Speaker 1]
Higher. It's using the AD&D chart.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
67 I believe is uncertain but friendly.

[Speaker 3]
And 56 is...

[Speaker 1]
I believe just uncertain.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well.

[Speaker 1]
Which do you prefer?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, 67. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
I will keep that in mind then. And what would you like to use your bonus action?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I have. This is weird to get used to, the new thing.

[Speaker 5]
You can change it back.

[Speaker 3]
So that's a little wrench up in the top corner?

[Speaker 5]
A little cog, you can go up the top right. You can go from default sheet to legacy 5e character sheet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I got it. Yeah, no, I can't do anything.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you do have bardic... Bardic inspiration, but Edmund! I'm gonna have you jump in here.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. There's not really much we can do as of now. You got a kiwi!

[Speaker 3]
Boy, thanks. I could throw a javelin. Sure.

But I should probably rage first. That'd be a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
I think she is raging, it's not a strategy.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm gonna just do that again, just so it uses the ability. Alrighty. And, um...

Throw my javelin.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the AC of this creature is 19.

[Speaker 6]
Got it.

[Speaker 3]
Oop, okay, well I missed.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, well now it probably doesn't view us as friendly.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi's just gonna dig her claws deeper into the vessel. You do have a second attack. I do have a second attack, ugh, okay.

Alright, you know, I've lost two javelins.

[Speaker 1]
You're probably gonna lose them either way.

[Speaker 2]
It's pronounced gav-lin, heck.

[Speaker 3]
Gav-lin. Let's kill this guy.

[Speaker 6]
Jesse. I'm gonna fucking kill you.

[Speaker 1]
Landy, are you there?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah? Oh. Um.

I'll... ...static. Uh... They're not close enough for me to use a spell.

I guess I'll hold compulsion if they come close enough within 30 feet. I'll cause compulsion on them.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Sounds good to me.

[Speaker 6]
It won't possibly, you know...

[Speaker 5]
Breath attack and kill us all?

[Speaker 6]
Wrong, kill you, not me.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should spread out a little bit.

[Speaker 1]
And have it do a legendary action to fly over.

[Speaker 5]
And how far does it get to?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, boy. Lightning bolt formation! Alright!

[Speaker 5]
Does it travel through the square?

[Speaker 1]
It does go through the square. It's, uh, cause the outside edge... It's a huge creature, so it's outside edge would go through that.

[Speaker 5]
Could it make a wisdom save, I think?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if it can make a wisdom save, but... Oh, it can.

[Speaker 5]
It can make a wisdom save!

[Speaker 1]
Oh! Well, what do you know?

[Speaker 6]
Alright, guys. I think... This is an actual fight.

[Speaker 5]
That looks sick.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that does look sick. Now recall, this is the first round of combat, so you do have resistance damage taken here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, thank god. No, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I still need... let's see here. Who did not do it yet?

Silk, Edmund.

[Speaker 6]
I did make my dex save.

[Speaker 1]
You... did make... no, you're correct.

Alright, and then Lucent did it, and then Jesse, is that everybody? Also Spirit. Ah, I see.

Okay, time for damage.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna use this.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you for half damage. Yes. That would've knocked me out.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I had to step away. Are we rolling a save against this?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so go ahead and make a save. Keep in mind, if you succeed, you take half. If you...

and then regardless of whether or not you succeed, you are resistant. Which was...

[Speaker 2]
Okay, how do you roll saves?

[Speaker 1]
The easiest part is to click on your character, and then scroll back up to where it says Lightning Breath and Rolls, and you'll be able to save.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
So that would either be... I forget. Does resistance round down or up?

[Speaker 1]
If you click on your character and then click Apply Half, it will do it automatically for you. Oh, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, dexterity saving throw, I see.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. What's the DC?

[Speaker 1]
DC is 19.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to burn a charge of my Ring of Evasion to automatically succeed.

[Speaker 1]
That's probably a good idea. Alright, so you will quarter the damage, instead of just halving it. Meanwhile, quarter.

It's a thing to loosen... yeah, so loosen and... what was it?

Because I passed, so that was... Silk are the only ones who made it there.

[Speaker 2]
So 62 div 4...

[Speaker 1]
So 15 damage.

[Speaker 2]
61 div 4. 15, are we rounding up or down?

[Speaker 1]
Down. I figured, based on the damage it dealt to Lucent there, it rounds down.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so that's 15 damage to Silk. Putting me at 44 hit points. Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody else took like 30.

[Speaker 7]
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is his turn. Bringing us to Silk.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy. Okay, stand by ground, shoot with advantage. The question is, which gun?

He's within 50. I'm going to use this one. It's a smoothbore musket.

Smoothbore musket. Oh my gosh, why? I'm getting item information, but not attack information.

[Speaker 1]
So it... don't click it again, it's in rolls. Remember, once you click it once, it'll go down to rolls.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Attack... with advantage.

Hits. 21, okay. For 22, oh, and an additional...

13 for a total of... 35.

[Speaker 1]
For a total of 33. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
35. Oh, 35. 35, yeah.

Bonus action... I want to use my... mage hand to also...

I hope there's enough slack in it because it's 60 feet. I want to tie a lifeline around... a Haleth as well.

I don't know, how much care do we need to take for our... minions in combat? Are they, like, non-combat?

[Speaker 1]
You need to take a little bit of care. So if that had gone... If you hadn't succeeded on your roll, and...

Kibi wasn't providing resistance, he would have been incapacitated.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. I don't want him to die, so I'm going to tie... the other half of my rope around him, you know, through a gunwale, or I assume there's...

nautical stuff like that, and that'll be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
It's easy to command him to, you know, command actions. Avoid suicide.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, avoid killing yourself, please.

[Speaker 1]
Very reasonable.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that brings us to Lucent.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Well, can't go wrong with dissonant whispers.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, that's right! Okay, I got an eight. Who does on this one?

[Speaker 2]
Ho ho ho ho ho! Apparently.

[Speaker 4]
That's a shame. And I think he takes...

[Speaker 7]
Half damage?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Or does he just take the full damage? Half.

[Speaker 7]
My half. Ho ho ho.

[Speaker 4]
Shame, because if it failed that wisdom save, then I'd be forced to either run away or burn a resistance.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, that's going to bring us to the top of the round.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, spirit. Oh, that's right, sorry, go ahead. So, gotta make sure to...

Yep, targeting's still good. Eye ray. That didn't fail.

But because it has multiattack... Yep, that hits, yeah. Absolutely hits, yes.

That'll be eleven... Second damage.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, looks, um...

[Speaker 1]
Paris, go ahead and make me either an insight... Go ahead and make me an insight check. You could use either wisdom or charisma for this.

[Speaker 3]
Obviously I'm using charisma. Insight, insight, insight. Can I do it again?

No!

[Speaker 1]
You rolled a one. I rolled a one. Well, it's got a very toothy face to it right now.

And it looks very, you know...

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna... First of all, can... A request, if you will.

Can you put a little health bar below the dragon?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
No, okay.

[Speaker 1]
You won't just tell us it's hit points?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna try to... Before I shoot it again... I'm gonna ask very nicely...

In hopes that this is an intelligent creature. Oh, I don't think we're gonna... Go on.

We don't have to fight. I said fight. Please?

We're just trying to get across... The way? She's not doing very well.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me a persuasion check.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Persuasion... Give me another one.

Oh, it's 22.

[Speaker 1]
Bring it from 67 to...

[Speaker 3]
We don't have to fight, big toothy dragon. Your scales are beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
Please don't! That looks kind of pleasantly surprised. It's going to...

Yeah, it's going to use a legendary action to swoop back. You just hear a voice call out from the clouds, I'll see if... My trophies are ready to...

Kneel or mount my wall next. In a few hours. Sorry.

I'll see if my trophies are ready to... Kneel or mount the wall... In a few hours.

It's going to use a legendary action to fly backwards.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we have a few more hours to live. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that's good. I didn't think that would work.

[Speaker 1]
It's sort of the pretty high reaction roll. It mostly just, according to the description, it mostly just wants to see submissiveness.

[Speaker 3]
Or submission. You're not going to get that from half the party. Karis, maybe.

Kibi, and likely our other barbarian, no.

[Speaker 1]
Bless you! Oh, it was a cough! Curse you!

What? Some of them are doing what you...

[Speaker 3]
Doing what you...

[Speaker 2]
Well, you saved our lives, so thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you!

[Speaker 2]
We could have slain the beast.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to go take a nap. Not Kibi. Karis is going to take a nap.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So you guys are going to land on Day 10 here. Now, please keep a careful attention to your hit dice and such.

And those of you who have expended any secondary class dice.

[Speaker 2]
So on this day of travel, we'll get back a... Tonight's rest will give us back one hit die, right? So we could kind of heal for free?

Heal one hit die for free?

[Speaker 1]
Is that right? On a short or long rest, you could heal any number of hit dice. Problem is, your recovery of those hit dice is delayed.

[Speaker 2]
So do we recover one tonight? You recover one tonight. Okay, so I'll spend one to heal that.

[Speaker 3]
Regardless of how many you spend right now.

[Speaker 2]
Right, only ever just the one. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I can cure wounds. I'm assuming I get my spell back on the second... On the morrow.

[Speaker 2]
There's... It's different for exploration. You get your level divided by two...

Many levels of spell slots back. However you want to break that down.

[Speaker 4]
You get some of them back. So I would get back my... My third...

Alright.

[Speaker 2]
So I get nine back. Oh, and it already healed me.

[Speaker 4]
So I get back my...

[Speaker 3]
Let me know if anyone does need cure wounds. Does that... Does sorcery points get...

Get regenerated on long rest under these altered conditions?

[Speaker 1]
So I think what gets regenerated is... Exploration... I think you just spend hit dice for them.

I don't know, but I'm about to check now. So if I look at points... That's hit points...

Spies, rations... Spell slots...

[Speaker 4]
Because it doesn't mention sorcery points. No, I think you're right. Neat.

So I get back my four expanded points, I guess. Yeah, I guess it's just... We were talking about that ages ago.

That should be fine.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. How do we... How do we get our hit dice back without getting hit points back?

[Speaker 5]
Sorry?

[Speaker 2]
I'm wondering, just on Foundry... To get back a hit die from resting without getting my hit points back... I could just long rest and then edit my hit points back down?

[Speaker 4]
And then you would edit your hit dice... I'm not sure how to edit it. You can use the icon at the top left.

You can use that, and then you can go under hit dice.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, edit mode. Okay, yeah, cool. That's it.

Perfect. Thanks. Yeah, that's great.

[Speaker 4]
All righty.

[Speaker 1]
You folks would land in a small kind of quarry that's been set up here. There's a lot of evidence of past mining expeditions that have occurred in this area. And as you guys travel over the fields here, there's much less that grows.

But... There's quite a few ruins and citadels, towers, that have just been scattered across the land. And then additional mines and fortifications have been set up here.

[Speaker 3]
What are they mining for, exactly?

[Speaker 1]
Well, quarries cut just literally rock out of the ground. In this case, it would be marble and granite. There's a small, very small village here.

It's kind of set up for itinerant miners and stoneworkers, I guess you could say. And then other people involved in transportation. It's mostly just a couple of hotels, taverns.

[Speaker 3]
Do we want to rest there?

[Speaker 1]
There's not many permanent residents.

[Speaker 2]
What time of day is it?

[Speaker 1]
At this point, it would be nearly dawn.

[Speaker 2]
Nearly dawn. Yeah, so I don't think we want to stay here. I think we should just go in and get rations and then start traveling.

Because we could travel all day today.

[Speaker 3]
You guys, can you get stuff for me? And I do some performing for the locals to maybe get some money.

[Speaker 2]
I have 11... Oh yeah, because I only have 11 rations. So we need 9 rations a day.

And is it 1 day per hex? Approximately? Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So we need 54 rations if we want no padding whatsoever. But we can also probably forage on the way. Is it possible to forage while traveling, or do you have to stop and spend the day to forage?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can forage while traveling. Okay, cool. So it's going to be another...

Oh, speaking of which, go ahead and start up a new exploration series. Go ahead and select your...

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'm going to do the same thing I did.

[Speaker 2]
So Haleth is a tracker, but his second level, because he's high enough level to get a second class, is the trailblazer. So he can't do both, right? You have to pick a lane?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think he's... I don't remember what it was. No, he's high enough to do...

So trailblazer isn't like a... Ping the thing that you're trying to do, or tell me what you're trying to do. I'm going to be gone for a second, but I do have my Bluetooth in.

And then the rest of you can choose an exploration role.

[Speaker 2]
I'm wondering if we can have... ...for monsters, but also the survivalist role to keep us on track.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to be vanguard, which is looking out and protecting against monsters, so you can half whatever damage you get. So that's perception.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so Edmund's going to turn to the party. He's going to exclaim that he wants to slay a dragon. Seems like a worthy opponent.

Well... And that we should maybe set a trap for it.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should avoid the trap. It's not the mission.

[Speaker 6]
It may not be the mission, but it would be one hell of a story to tell.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, he got me there. That would be true, yeah. Oh, I'm a sucker for a good story.

[Speaker 6]
We slay the beast! And we take home its hide as our trophy.

[Speaker 2]
We'd rather take home the horde as our trophy. Maybe we can figure out where it lives.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's down to fight the dragon.

[Speaker 4]
Paris is not.

[Speaker 3]
Think about it like this.

[Speaker 6]
We let it live. It harasses us another day.

[Speaker 3]
Or others, you know. Or it kills us today and eats us tomorrow.

[Speaker 6]
In that case, we just have to be stronger.

[Speaker 3]
I think we need more potions and magic.

[Speaker 6]
Then let us stock up. This is a town, is it not?

[Speaker 3]
Well, yes.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if magic's really within the purview of this little rink-a-dink operation.

[Speaker 6]
But we could stock up on maybe some explosives, potions, supplies.

[Speaker 2]
I think we could probably stock up on, like, hammers. And, like, rope. I think that's more of the...

[Speaker 6]
Edmund kind of pulls out his pack. And he displays a ton of iron spikes in his bag.

[Speaker 3]
What are those for?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Never ask a man what his iron spikes are for.

[Speaker 6]
Let me tell you something.

[Speaker 2]
Here it comes.

[Speaker 6]
Even the biggest beast... ...cannot handle... ...getting nails shoved into itself.

[Speaker 3]
Karis is just gonna, like, kind of rub her forehead. Like, you know, like she's got a headache now.

[Speaker 2]
I wrestled a bear once! And I used these.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's listening intently. So what you do...

[Speaker 6]
...is you pretend to bow to this dragon. And it lands on this huge... Yes.

And it lands on this huge pile of spikes. Hidden.

[Speaker 3]
Ouch. Ouch indeed. Tempting.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Silk failed the survivalist roll. Oh no. The survivalist roll roll.

[Speaker 6]
And if the dragon attacks this town... ...and we don't kill it... ...we'll have more blood on our hands than...

...if we just went straight to where we need to go.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I don't mind having blood on my hands. But it wouldn't be ideal.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the... Let's see here. Okay, the survival skill check was a fail.

Your tracker's automatically gonna succeed the tracking check.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but he's also a trailblazer. Does he get a benefit... Does he basically have to pick...

Like, is he gonna be a tracker or a survival thing?

[Speaker 1]
Well, he would do anything. But he gets...

[Speaker 2]
Only one, right?

[Speaker 1]
Just one when you're...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay. Okay. I gotcha.

And he did tracking, so that's it. And Silk will do survival.

[Speaker 1]
I think literally the only exception is rangers.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Right, right.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... I guess it could be the cook, maybe. What check would that be?

Check with cook's utensils. I do not have proficiency in that. As far as things you can buy in this town...

[Speaker 1]
As... It's correctly noted that no, there are no magic items for purchase... ...in a glorified hotel or...

I guess... This is the stone equivalent of an Amazon distribution center. With some additional living quarters outside.

But, as far as explosives go... You could try to purchase some surplus explosives. There would be a markup on them.

[Speaker 3]
Potions? What? Potions.

I would like some healing potions.

[Speaker 1]
Healing potions? You could try to purchase them. I think that you might be able to purchase some off some miners...

...and prospectors nearby.

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
And there are an abundance of prospectors nearby.

[Speaker 3]
Because I'm a minstrel, there's a... Hold on, where can I find the... ...features? I can...

...play some songs and whatnot. Perform for, like... For some kind of...

If you want to...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you want to stay here an additional day, you could do that.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I don't think my companions here would like to stay an entire day.

[Speaker 2]
I just want to buy rations and get out of here, basically. I don't know how much we can, like... They'd actually be willing to sell us, or how many they actually have.

But we'd want about 54... ...which would be 27 gold.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'll use some of my...

[Speaker 2]
I'd like to inquire about the explosives. Do you have any sticks of dynamite?

[Speaker 4]
Yep. So, wait, 27 gold for 50 rations?

[Speaker 2]
54, yeah. It's half a gold per.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'll just... I'll do that. I'll be...

491.

[Speaker 2]
Unless I want to try to negotiate for a bulk discount or something.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you could get a stick of dynamite for about... The market would be... You could get one about 75...

Yeah, it's about 75 bucks per stick. Gold per stick. And for the rations?

For the rations, that would be normal. There's a caravan coming through that's looking to... ...just sell some goods, but also to travel. They're traveling along most of the... ...those tiny little shipping towns that exist along this loop.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so 54...

[Speaker 2]
Do we get, like, the bad rations? Like, the Lunchables without the little pizza one? We get the little, like, crappy Oreo one?

[Speaker 1]
Without the pizza one? No. So the, um...

You know, they're all, like, MREs, basically. They're... They get the job done.

Mostly steel and resin. Yeah. Some of them are past their inspection date, but not past their expiration date.

[Speaker 6]
I throw down 300 gold pieces, and I say, I'll have four sticks.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, thank you. Remember to blast in this area. You do need a permit, but...

I get the sense you're not actually staying here, so...

[Speaker 2]
You'd be correct. What would you say is the safe distance to be away if a stick of dynamite were to explode?

[Speaker 3]
Away.

[Speaker 2]
Side note, that's exactly how far away I'm sleeping from the rest of the party.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the biggest blast is about... I'd stay at least 30 feet away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. That's not bad. Um, this question is maybe just academic.

The crafting secondary class can kind of do, like, a mix-in of other ingredients? So that could maybe do explosive rounds if we have explosive stuff?

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I have alchemist's fire.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. All right. That's more of a question for downtime.

If I can get the... I mean, we're getting a markup here, so this isn't the place to buy it. But silk will probably be...

[Speaker 1]
Then you'd have to find the materials. And that's any class. I mean, you could use pretty much any materials or any material cost.

Material value, for the most part. Yeah, for something like an explosive, you would want something that is somewhat explosive in nature. Or you would want an alchemist with you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, not an alchemist. But because I'm a crafter, I have the traveling tradesman. Is it possible for me to try to make, like, business connections here?

So that the next time I come, I maybe get a discount? As, like, a fellow crafter tradesman? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and just make me a generic either persuasion check or something like that. And probably... You could use your proficiency with, like...

Yeah, go ahead and make your persuasion check. Tinker's tools would be appropriate. And then if you wanted to add your craftsman dice to this, then you would be able to do so.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay. And how generic difficulty? Are we, like...

Is this probably going to be challenging? Or not very challenging?

[Speaker 1]
Or do I not get to know?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll do one... I'll do one crafting die then.

And that's just your hit die, right?

[Speaker 1]
So you could roll. And you could choose to add dice after you roll.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I can choose to roll after.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. You just can't...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, boom.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're fine. For situations like that, just roll that d12.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, but when you pick, you don't get to pick again. You, like, you lock yourself in. Okay, gotcha.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so... Alright, yeah, you guys. Anybody else want to do something here?

[Speaker 6]
I'd like to purchase a thing of alchemist fire. So I have a way to light these dynamite from a range. Sure thing.

[Speaker 2]
And what's the name of this settlement? Just so I can have it in my notes. Where I'm getting the discount at.

[Speaker 1]
This one? We'll call this Quarren's Quarry.

[Speaker 2]
I guess it's not really a discount. There's just no markup.

[Speaker 1]
You can set up a... Yeah, there we go. Quarren's Quarry.

You can set up, like, a trade route. Or a trading relationship with these guys. Especially if you have your own settlement or business.

[Speaker 2]
Let's say trading relationship at Quarren's Quarry. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I would like to buy some potions from the locals. Just some health potions.

[Speaker 1]
They're probably going to be a hundred a piece.

[Speaker 3]
Could I somehow take the price down a bit? Like haggling or something?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, not in this case. The haggling part is going to be, like, getting them to sell it to you. It's like, well, you haven't used it yet.

Come on, when are you really going to need it? If the roof caves in on you, what good is a healing potion going to do anyways?

[Speaker 3]
It's already smashed in your bag. Alright, I can buy three. That's three health potions.

And I have 300 coins left. Three health potions. How do I add things?

[Speaker 6]
Aha, we're going to slay a beast this day.

[Speaker 3]
I don't want to fight a dragon.

[Speaker 1]
You look for the top three dots on your character sheet, and then you would go to equipment shop. And you could then add some healing potions in. Or you could do it through the plutonium import as well.

I'll do plutonium.

[Speaker 3]
Because I know how to get there.

[Speaker 1]
Let's try this. I have my ring of spells storing. Well, to be fair, now you still have the...

[Speaker 4]
Charges, yeah. I just realized, part of the starting equipment for, like, people with the archaeologist background wouldn't case containing a map to a ruin or dungeon.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, then, Landy, go ahead and make a check for your buddy here.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, what?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry, you wanted to start him off. So, the party landed at a place called Quorum's Quarry. They're about to make a...

Technically, they're in here now, so it's really a 5k journey. You either have them meet here, or you could have them meet at the excavation site.

[Speaker 5]
I was thinking at the excavation site. My character would just be there looking for work as well.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Oh, that's it.

[Speaker 3]
Oops, I was looking at that. My bad.

[Speaker 1]
You're fine. Okay, so on the last day that you guys get here, the excavation site is inside. It's up here.

You guys see a few buildings, along with a pyramid that's stretching up out of the depression inside the ground. The pyramid itself is made of onyx and has a dun-brown light emanating from its panels. And everything else looks quite mundane, but it has been cloudy for the last few days, awfully windy.

Loud enough to make it difficult to hear. A few more travelers along the road here. We're going to introduce Lulandy's new character here.

[Speaker 5]
He is a... Appears to be a male drow.

[Speaker 3]
Appears to be? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
He's quite fair-skinned compared to a typical drow, though. Looks kind of odd. And he is wearing purple cloak and hat.

[Speaker 6]
I shake his hand. Well, try to.

[Speaker 2]
He, uh, would not do that. Any obvious weaponry?

[Speaker 5]
Got a staff.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Alright. The more the merrier.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. More the merrier.

[Speaker 6]
I turn to the party and I say, This guy, he looks like dragon-slain material.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you and this dragon.

[Speaker 5]
I don't have any plans on fighting dragons today. First to that.

[Speaker 6]
We might not have a choice depending on how things go. Yeah, I don't.

[Speaker 3]
He seemed pretty okay with me complimenting his scales, so if we do that again, maybe we don't need to find him.

[Speaker 6]
He said a couple hours.

[Speaker 3]
Well, he'll have to find us first. And it's not like we're in the sky waiting for him. We're on the ground now.

And unless he's been watching us this whole time, she's like looking around.

[Speaker 6]
You know, I'm not sure if they'd do that, but they might.

[Speaker 4]
Don't some dragons have the ability to shapeshift?

[Speaker 6]
What are you implying?

[Speaker 3]
Ah, nothing. Looking at our new addition. So how far, how close are we?

Are we, like, right here?

[Speaker 1]
At this point you guys are about five days off. You're approaching the gate of the world roots. E-I-C-A.

Go ahead and make, who is our, sorry, who is our vanguard here?

[Speaker 3]
Kibi.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi. Kibi, go ahead and make me another perception check.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Whichever check you want.

[Speaker 3]
Perception.

[Speaker 1]
That'll do. Alright. Sixteen.

Good, good enough. You see that there is a centaur raiding party coming over the hills.

[Speaker 3]
Are they native to this land? Yeah, I think I heard, I remember you said something about it in Discord.

[Speaker 1]
Paris would be aware that they are.

[Speaker 3]
Are they hostile?

[Speaker 1]
They are not happy about recent events here. They were originally just kind of, you know, trying to figure out a way to coexist with the excavation team. Once the mummy's pyramid kind of dropped in, they were far more outright hostile from that point onwards.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should talk to them, because they could be good allies. And I have pretty high charisma.

[Speaker 1]
The one at the top of the party appears to be casting a spell.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, maybe we should wait and see what he casts first.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that would probably be best.

[Speaker 3]
And that'll also expend a spell slot if they do decide to attack us.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like to use a power just preemptively. I'm going to use precognition to up my initiative bonus.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, sure.

[Speaker 2]
Um, what kind of cover do we have?

[Speaker 1]
This is open terrain. There is a, you know, there is... Yeah, okay, there is a caravan next to you, so there is wagons that you can kind of hide behind.

[Speaker 2]
Um, in terms of concealment, is there like low grass or anything that Silk could maybe hide behind as a wood elf?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's plenty of prairie grass nearby.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, Silk will get down and kind of start crawling away from the group to try to hide and make himself a difficult target to hit.

[Speaker 3]
So what does this, um, what does this dude cast? What spell is he casting? Do I recognize it at all?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me from this long, this far away, go ahead and make me an arcana check with disadvantage.

[Speaker 4]
Can I also make an arcana check? You may. Alright.

It'll also be disadvantage. Alright, I'll, uh, use, uh... I'll use quite a bit of my Scholar Dice, 2d6 my Scholar Dice.

14.

[Speaker 1]
Neither of you happen to notice it. Or happen to recognize it. So we know something happened, but we don't know what.

Okay. You do notice that the sky has turned a little bit of an odd shade of green.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, we're gonna step in. Or at least, Karis is? You guys can follow, certainly.

Appreciatively. I'm gonna go out in front of them. And wave them down.

Hello! Hey! You!

Uh, they're centaurs, right? It's like, I always get minotaurs and centaurs. They're half horse people, right?

[Speaker 1]
They're half horse, yeah yeah yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Centaurs! Uh...

Hello! How do they, how do they, uh... How do they react?

[Speaker 1]
They just kind of snort, stamp their feet, but not really... Super interested at the moment.

[Speaker 3]
I've noticed that there's quite a bit of mining and excavation in this area, and I was wondering... If you guys might know why?

[Speaker 1]
That would depend on what I hear, I mean... Okay. Uh, they seem to recognize that you're...

This is Karis talking, right? Okay, they recognize that you're Fae. Like, hmm.

There's a, there's an old gate here called the Ysrigan. It's been, you know, defunct for some time. We haven't really been, haven't really cared to use it in a while, but it deactivated, and then shortly thereafter this mining company came out.

That was, we had some skirmishes, had some issues. We were discussing ways to help them reactivate it, so among other things they could just leave. But things took a turn for the worse for them, and then the pyramid teleported in, just appeared one page.

And now the area is covered in cobwebs, scorpions, spiders, and other disgusting creatures. And now we're figuring out a proper method of all-out war. We thought, as of today, that we would start by testing a tornado.

[Speaker 3]
Well, is there any way we could help with that?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, let us know how the tornado goes. And hopefully it'll kill everything out there, we'll be able to see if it destroys the pyramid. But, you know, if it just happens to destroy the camp, that will be fine.

We will be observing from a safer distance. That's probably wise.

[Speaker 3]
What do we think? Is this out of character? Is this camp, like, do we need this camp, or would this camp being out of the picture be greatly in our favor?

[Speaker 2]
Well, they're trying to get rid of the pyramid, right? They're not hostile to the miners, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, the pyramid, here's the thing. They were initially not super hostile to them, they would just raid them a little bit occasionally. At this point, they're a little bit, it's more that they're hostile to the pyramid and then the miners by extension.

But the pyramid is sitting directly, if we think of this as like a six-sided excavation site. The pyramid is directly on the south end. So if a tornado touches down in that area, it's, I mean, the miners' buildings are all, those are all wooden.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so the pyramid and the miners' encampment are like the same area, basically.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
And the miners work for Zephain, I think you said?

[Speaker 1]
They were contracted out by, what you could figure out is that they were contracted out by Pythas. They're not really happy with their conditions at the moment. We could also get them to turn on him.

Yeah, things have really not been going well for them as of late. When that tornado struck, they wouldn't. Yeah, that's also why they took in, that's also why they took in about two minutes left to go.

You guys can at this point see the funnel cloud starting to form over the pyramid.

[Speaker 3]
I have a horrible idea. All right, so we let the tornado ravage a part of the little mining encampment. And then I use my harp to make it go away.

And I am now their savior. So we are branded as the people that saved the rest of the people. And that makes them like us a little bit more than they would if we were just some random strangers coming in.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. Also, at this point, the centaurs have bounced because they said that they were going to watch from a safer distance. But they would have given you the coordinates and the passwords to their camp at this point.

Wonderful.

[Speaker 4]
Let's go.

[Speaker 3]
Let's try, what do you guys think of the idea that I spat out? It could backfire. It seems dishonorable.

[Speaker 2]
It does seem dishonorable.

[Speaker 3]
It does seem dishonorable, but I mean...

[Speaker 4]
Dishonorable, but also possible backfire? Because what if they think we brought it in the first place?

[Speaker 3]
They could, but it is a natural occurrence and we could just dispel it.

[Speaker 6]
Do you want to fight an army of centaurs?

[Speaker 3]
No, not necessarily.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, this isn't necessarily our fight.

[Speaker 3]
Then again, we could just let them all die. The whole camp? Not the centaurs.

The centaurs, they're good. But the miners, the operation. I was thinking we could at least leave some of them alive to help us.

To like us.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, how much can we do? The tornado's getting created right now.

[Speaker 1]
The tornado has at this point actually touched down.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm gonna...

[Speaker 1]
The tornado weather takes about 10 minutes apiece to take effect. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
How close is it to the camp right now?

[Speaker 1]
It is nearly on top of the pyramid.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm gonna start casting Dispel. The centaurs can't see us, can they?

[Speaker 1]
No, not at this point.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll start casting Dispel.

[Speaker 1]
If you were to cast Dispel, you would be able to find cover for it. What are you casting, by the way?

[Speaker 3]
I'm using the Change Weather for my harp. Unless that doesn't work because it's magical.

[Speaker 1]
No, Change Weather. Yeah, that'd be fine. When you kept saying Dispel, I was wondering if you meant Dispel Magic.

[Speaker 3]
No, sorry. But yeah, Charis is gonna start soothing the weather. And her music will unravel the tornado as it's destroying some of the village.

[Speaker 5]
It takes 10 minutes to cast, right? How far does it get?

[Speaker 1]
It mostly hovers around the... I'm going to roll a die. I'm gonna roll two of them, all right?

[Speaker 3]
Since we know where it's going, let's stay behind it.

[Speaker 1]
North will be one. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it will be able to pick up the... I'm not worried about the pyramid because it's really heavy and I don't think it'll...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's not gonna pick up the pyramid. Frankly, it doesn't really damage the pyramid that much. There's not enough material nearby that's both heavy and sturdy enough to get flung by the tornado.

So, basically just scratches. Yeah, at best. It's made of onyx.

Nothing's really happening there. And then on top of that, let's see here. One, so it goes up, and then six would be what?

Yeah, if one is that, then six would be here, and five would be... Okay, so it goes north, and then it goes west, and slams into the warehouse and begins messing it up about to the point that you succeed in dispelling it, or that it would take effect.

[Speaker 3]
Do they see me dispel it? Does anyone?

[Speaker 1]
Does anyone see you dispel it? How... I mean, the people next to you would see you dispel it.

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't think there's anyone else within eyesight.

[Speaker 1]
Well, there's the caravan with you guys. There's other people kind of like traveling alongside of you. That's because they were leaving on the same day.

But the centaurs wouldn't see you. Why do you ask? It sounds like you want something specific, but like you already heard it.

[Speaker 3]
I want them to think, I want them to know that it was me that dispelled it so that they can accept us easier.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, like you have much more eyewitnesses right next to you.

[Speaker 3]
And also, I personally don't care about the loss of life, but everyone else in the party, in our party, does. So hopefully I got it in time. Okay.

What does that make Charis? Say again? What does that make Charis?

Is she chaotic evil or neutral evil?

[Speaker 4]
I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
You're going to ask me to speculate right now. Okay, so the pyramid has been dispelled. You guys are approaching the camp here, the excavation camp.

The first two buildings that you come across are basically, there's the warehouse behind, which is much closer to the camp itself, the camp proper, kind of almost hanging off into the hole. And then there is an intake building right in front of you. It's a little bit closer to dusk.

A bunch of people have been scurrying around, including who Charis would recognize as being the foreman.

[Speaker 3]
Foreman, that's like the...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's the guy basically in charge of the, not in charge of the construction and stuff like that. He's not necessarily management, but he's the person who's in charge of all the workers.

[Speaker 3]
Is the guy that does management, is he on site or is he... Because that would be kind of awkward. What?

The guy that, because we were not hired, but we're going to pretend to be hired.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so the people meet with the foreman to get hired, pretty much.

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so is the play to say that we already got hired by someone else, like we bypassed you? Or is the play we go, hey, we're really good. Why don't you hire us, Mr. Foreman?

Which way do we want to go with it?

[Speaker 3]
Good question.

[Speaker 1]
You guys got two minutes to decide because right now he's running out. You guys are quite close to the building at this point, and he's running out to the caravan.

[Speaker 2]
I think we've got a really good case for them to hire us because we just dispelled the tornado. So I think the less deception we need to use, the better.

[Speaker 5]
I like that.

[Speaker 6]
All right. You know, the centaurs probably won't be too happy about this.

[Speaker 3]
They don't need to know.

[Speaker 6]
They probably saw their tornado literally go poof.

[Speaker 3]
Well, there's probably a wizard somewhere in the camp, right?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, give me enough bullets, I'll take care of them.

[Speaker 1]
I wish we had a mundane wizard with us, but, you know, we have a different kind of neighbor set up. I'm Zacharias, this rather tall tiefling. He's got a tradition.

He's got white kind of alabaster skin, and he's got gold eyes. Poor. Actually, do we have any clerics in the party?

Any religious characters?

[Speaker 3]
Doesn't sound like it.

[Speaker 2]
Questions are above my pay grid.

[Speaker 4]
No worries. I'm losing specs, so it might be that his family, like, have a couple clerics, like, distantly.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's not him.

[Speaker 1]
This is a relation to the clergy.

[Speaker 2]
I minored in theology.

[Speaker 1]
Minored in theology, pretty much. Really appreciate you guys being here. We're going to have everybody scramble into the warehouse for now, and then once we get all the goods unloaded, we'll put you in intake.

We don't know if another funnel's going to come down, but it's nice to meet you. I'm Zacharias.

[Speaker 3]
Nice to meet you as well. We saw that. What was that?

[Speaker 1]
That's called a tornado.

[Speaker 3]
Well, obviously, but do they happen often here?

[Speaker 1]
It depends on whether or not somebody's trying to make them happen.

[Speaker 4]
Magical interference?

[Speaker 3]
I tried to get rid of it as quickly as I could. Was there any loss of life?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's interesting that you say that. At this point, the caravan people would probably be like, yeah, I saw her. I saw her try to fuck with it.

I saw her get rid of it, blah, blah, blah. It's like, oh, oh, that was he. Yeah, there's definitely a few injuries.

But here, we'll talk about it inside. Good idea. So everybody spritz over.

There's a bunch of ettins standing guard at the warehouse. They take the doors up, and then they begin offloading pallets of, like, cinder blocks, fiberglass, iron ingots. I think there were things here.

And then wood, which is, at this point, sparse in the local area.

[Speaker 6]
You all need help with that?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, can we help?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they accept help, just kind of like sorting things.

[Speaker 4]
They don't quite have pallet tracks, but they do have dollies.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, mage hand time.

[Speaker 4]
I can perform a light bit of healing.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we're going to need your spells. If you want to spellcast this, we're going to need them for other things.

[Speaker 4]
No, I can only heal, like, one person. I mean, if that helps.

[Speaker 2]
I can do this, and I flip up on my hands. Acrobatics check. Does that help?

[Speaker 1]
Ratcatcher is eccentric, as always. Let's go to the intake building.

[Speaker 2]
OK, I want to try to walk there on my hands, if that's possible.

[Speaker 1]
At 15, you're going to have some difficulty there.

[Speaker 2]
Excellent.

[Speaker 1]
All right, please, quit that. Yes, I'm very impressed. Come with me.

[Speaker 2]
All right, OK. Thank you. Yeah, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
OK. You guys make it to the intake building. The weather has calmed down a little bit.

It's still dark and stormy and such, but you're at a risk of producing a funnel cloud. It's a normal, kind of fading light now, as opposed to slipping green. You guys are...

Well, I suppose I don't have a... Yeah, it's going to be a long night, so I'll just start from the top here. We really welcome ratcatchers, adventurers, especially if you know any magic or if you have any experience with the Fae or the Arcane.

We don't really have much in the way of instant or quick healing at the moment, so be warned. I'm obligated to tell you that workplace injuries are common. Luckily, we do.

Our neighbor is quite skilled at not just healing but preserving people, so if you are mortally wounded, your body would be preserved until a time such as somebody could pay for your resurrection or revivify, as it were. Less expensive, then.

[Speaker 4]
Well, gentle repose.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, exactly. But unfortunately, I just had to send about five more workers over there, so the conditions here are tough. But I think that folks of your sort have a place here not just necessarily digging and helping us in the archaeological sense but also in managing some of the threats and dangers that we continually, constantly face for this godforsaken job that, frankly, our company was not paid enough money to handle.

But the faster that we get it taken care of, the faster we'll be able to get out of here. And, in fact, the project, if you're interested, I'll tell you a little bit more about it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yes, please.

[Speaker 2]
Please. Please do.

[Speaker 1]
It's been quite a bit since I got interested in archaeological expedition. That is handy to hear. So we're looking for something called the Ysregan.

It's currently protected by me. It takes you guys over to the intake. It's darker out, so you guys are able to...

But there are torches that are getting relit along the platform. You guys see an entrance to some kind of fortification that looks like a large ball. It's stone.

It has two turrets off the side. It is nestled on a platform that spans roughly... There we go.

That has been partially excavated. The ground-level platform is about 800 feet from east to west. There is a perfectly round hole in the platform at its furthest point south, where it's kind of like hanging over the excavation.

That's where the hole in the ground starts. And there are four pillars built into the hole that stretch all the way down. They're deep enough to go below the excavation's bottom and perfectly straight to go downwards.

So somewhere in there is the Ysregan. And we are able to get inside. The problem is, I think, opening the door itself is what activates the Ysregan.

It's a portal network. It's not instantaneous travel. You have to take things for it, right?

And you have to do some foot progress on your own.

[Speaker 3]
What's on the other side?

[Speaker 4]
I'm just going to... Sorry, what? I was just going to use my little background feature.

Where is it?

[Speaker 1]
Just ping whenever you have the opportunity. So the Ysregan doesn't go to a specific place. They're like networks.

They're nodes in this network. And you can deviate the nodes to go to specific places. Supposedly, it's going to be able to carry us all throughout Semed, and we think there's another network connection back where we're from, which we'd very much love to get back to.

Our normal costs incurred when we're trying to travel back home are pretty expensive. Offloading everything or just leaving spare materials behind, nobody likes that. But if we were able to take the portal back, then we would actually make...

We would recoup quite a few of our costs here. It was either that or set up a settlement on this end, but at this point we're not too keen on that. We'd rather just leave.

[Speaker 3]
Why don't you?

[Speaker 1]
Well, because we need to get our money first so we can go back home. And that means getting the gate open.

[Speaker 3]
Do you know what's on the other side of this gate besides...

[Speaker 1]
Well, as mentioned, it is a network, so there's no specific other side of the gate. There's just, you know, there are places that we can go.

[Speaker 2]
How extensively have you probed this? How many different nodes have you discovered in the network?

[Speaker 1]
Zero. We only know that there are different nodes. And then, let's see here.

Has to take its original purpose to determine its builders. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Then I'll be able to set that up.

[Speaker 2]
Cartography will come in handy if we're going to be transporting into new and strange areas. To help prevent us from getting lost. We may be able to get, if we have a good relationship with these people, we may be able to get explosives at a better rate.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'm back. Sorry, what was the question?

[Speaker 2]
Well, first it was just an observation to my fellow players that cartography will probably come in handy here if there's going to be teleportation to strange areas to help prevent getting lost. To help map them out. And then providing that map to them, to the miners, could be a concrete turn-in for us.

And then the other question was, at this camp, since we're going to be working for them, I wonder if we could get explosives without the markup. Like, explosives at cost from them. If they've brought any with them for excavation purposes.

[Speaker 1]
Well, they're not merchants is the thing. But they might be able to... You might be able to negotiate something with a quartermaster.

Yeah, like a company quartermaster. But at the same time, they use those explosives for a pretty specific purpose.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, if we see a need, we can talk to the quartermaster and try to give an argument there.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it would be like a job-by-job basis. And then I swear Charis had a question.

[Speaker 2]
There was a feature they wanted to use.

[Speaker 3]
I did, but I have ADHD and completely forgot it.

[Speaker 2]
Historical knowledge?

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's Lucent. I'm going to get to them next. Charis, go ahead and make an insight check.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I have proficiency.

[Speaker 1]
He's definitely concealing something about what's on the other side bit. Let's see here. And Lucent would know that, just based on his recent studies, especially going through old historical records in Bromlock, that the Ysregan is a portal network.

There's not many central... There's like a central hub, and then there are places that you can kind of call the routes to come back to you so that you can get to the central hub to begin with. But...

Yeah. So there are dedicated nodes to it. And between the two of you, you can probably guess that he's lying about what's specifically on the other side.

Whatever he's trying to connect it to probably knows what's on the other side bit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I should probably dig into that a little bit.

[Speaker 4]
I would quietly relay this using my telepathy to the rest of the party.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, okay. So Charis is going to address him. You're looking for this, and you have no idea what could come through the other side.

That sounds dangerous.

[Speaker 1]
Money. And it's exactly the kind of job that we take.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, but you said you didn't. You guys weren't getting paid well.

[Speaker 1]
We're not paid right now because we haven't got paid right now because we haven't finished the job, of course. Yes. And, you know, it takes a lot of resources to keep pulling up workers, but that's exactly the sort of reason why we would end up giving you an additional...

you know, giving you a premium rate because you seem... Hell, if you get south of Tornadoes, you must have something of value to offer us here. And, yeah.

Yeah, I think we could give you a premium rate for your services. How's...

[Speaker 5]
Could I please read his thoughts?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may.

[Speaker 5]
Can he make an intelligence saving throw?

[Speaker 3]
I'd like to read his emotions, too. What song does he sing?

[Speaker 1]
All right, yes. Let's see here. Service thoughts?

First thing is, like, I really just hope Myfus doesn't start questioning me. We've got enough on my plate already, but they look to be worth about... As a whole, they could probably spare about $600 a week.

That's top, so I'll price them at $30 a person. See how they like it. So, I could give you about a $30 a person here.

Per week.

[Speaker 3]
And what of rations?

[Speaker 1]
All meals, lodgings, and such would be taken care of. Given that you're the rat catchers, you would be able to sleep in the quarters, which are highest here, and then if you do really well here, we even let you sleep around in the management building. But yeah, we would start you off with our best working accommodations.

[Speaker 3]
Well.

[Speaker 6]
Not a bad offer.

[Speaker 3]
Not a bad offer.

[Speaker 1]
Not a bad offer, yeah. If you need the time to think about it, you would just have to sleep in the intake quarters over there, adjacent to the brig. We do lock them, but, you know, just for safety precautions, of course.

But, once we're able to figure something out, I need to go, I'll be back in an hour to check up on you, and then, please don't go anywhere, of course, but I'll be back in an hour, it looks like we need to get this lift fixed. And then you can relay your decision then, or tell me whether you need more time to think on it.

[Speaker 3]
Well, thank you for the offer, we will certainly think about it.

[Speaker 6]
Admin's gonna turn to the party and say, Well, I think there's a bunk calling our name.

[Speaker 3]
Indeed, there is. Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I do imagine we have to wait first. Gonna see about healing one particular fellow when I get the chance.

[Speaker 3]
Um, has the foreman walked off?

[Speaker 1]
At this point he's walked off, yeah. He said he's gonna be back in an hour, so.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think he's lying about not knowing what's on the other side.

[Speaker 4]
Well, that much is quite obvious.

[Speaker 6]
You see, and this is the fun part.

[Speaker 4]
Like it's a mystery box that you just don't know what will come out.

[Speaker 2]
Do we really think 30 is all he's willing to spend on us?

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
He's got work stoppage. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
He did say we could work our way up to the management place.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm not, I don't think I want a career here.

[Speaker 6]
Neither do I. I could make much more if I just fell a dragon in one slash. Smash.

[Speaker 3]
A couple nights at a tavern. Playing an instrument, mind you.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, sure. Speaking of, you should play an instrument now.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, speaking of scrolls, dude. Man, it's people.

[Speaker 6]
This is a time to relax.

[Speaker 2]
How high can we get him? What do you all think is fair? And their knowledge of its capacities and how to affect it.

That's my proposal.

[Speaker 4]
I would have to agree. He's just like during this time, like, Lucid is just like taking a sip of his coffee.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, I'm going to take a short break here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we'll put the dragon as plan B.

[Speaker 6]
Hold on, I actually want to discuss that during this break. You guys can keep discussing things.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
I will not be present for a moment.

[Speaker 6]
So, regarding the dragon. Yeah. I'm trying to roleplay it, but in actuality, I just want to kill a fucking dragon.

That sounds sick for my first session with this character. That's my actual reason. Roleplay-wise, I think there's a lot to be gained.

Like, for example, we slay this dragon, right? How many of you guys have done the House of Hope in BG3? I have.

Okay, so you know... Yes, you know when... If you offer to get the Gauntlets of Cloud Giant Strength, right?

Or Cloud Giant, I think. You get them, you kill Raphael, and then you come back, and she... I forgot her name, she's like...

Give me Gauntlets, right? And you're like, I just killed a fucking devil in his own home.

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Excuse me, what? A devil in his own home?

[Speaker 2]
The idea is that we have more bargaining power if we kill the dragon.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, if we kill a dragon, we just all of a sudden are super intimidating and can tell people to get the fuck out of here.

[Speaker 2]
That is true. But I don't think we need to intimidate them.

[Speaker 3]
We just need to be like, hey, the other people, we just killed a dragon, and we are scared of what's on the other side.

[Speaker 2]
You know, you have a fair point.

[Speaker 3]
No, they'll kill us. They'll kill us all.

[Speaker 6]
The point I'm trying to make here is, killing a dragon makes an epic fight, firstly. Just gameplay, right? You kill a fucking dragon.

And then, we can use it as leverage. It's gonna be a difficult fight, I know. It's probably not gonna be easy.

We don't know anything about this guy, other than...

[Speaker 2]
It's CR 15.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, he just... And we're level 8. And 15 is bigger than 8.

Very, very tough, yes. Yeah. But the challenge, if we slay this, firstly, just metagaming-wise, we're gonna get some XP for sure.

[Speaker 3]
Indeed. So, one thing that was said in the thread that we were typing in, there's things to sabotage here. There are things we can sabotage to make the place a bit less worky.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Well, I think first we have to decide which objective we want to pursue.

[Speaker 6]
I want to pursue the dragon. I vote dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no. No, I got that.

[Speaker 6]
I vote dragon!

[Speaker 2]
If we want to... Do we want to disable the gate permanently? Or do we just want to stop their progress?

[Speaker 6]
Stop their progress.

[Speaker 3]
Stop their progress, because we could use the gates.

[Speaker 6]
Yep. See, I like your thinking.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so if we just want to stop their progress, then we need to either convince them to leave voluntarily, or get them to leave against their will. You know, like, coerce them into leaving.

[Speaker 3]
You could just kill them all. Well, I'm not against the loss of life.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, yes.

[Speaker 3]
On a mass scale. And I'm not very comfortable with that.

[Speaker 6]
Let's murder Hoburn and out, yeah. Let's be fucking... Let's be like, Hey, James, it's not antisocial because we're all being antisocial.

[Speaker 3]
We're committing mass murder, oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
I think the problem with just stopping their progress is that if it's not these people, it's going to be someone else.

[Speaker 6]
At the very least, it buys time. Okay, at the very least, it buys time. And...

You know, there's a dragon out there who might be causing issues.

[Speaker 3]
It just has to be not worth the money.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but it has to be not worth... We have some more immediate concerns, right? This dragon terrorizing the nearby areas.

[Speaker 2]
Right, how much have we heard about the dragon terrorizing anything? Okay, it exists.

[Speaker 6]
That's enough of an issue.

[Speaker 2]
It exists.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should burn that bridge when we get to it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think if we can figure out a way to permanently close this off or for us to have control over it in a way that they can't interfere with, that'll be good. Because that'll basically make it harder for any future... for any future excavation to happen from the bad guys.

But just getting these people to leave because they're scared or you kill enough of them or something, they'll get replaced eventually.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we need to make it... Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Something more permanent would be beneficial. Might not even be possible, but it's probably worth spending a couple days to figure out what's going on.

[Speaker 3]
We have the pass phrase to get into the Cintar camp.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So they could help as well. We should probably, at some point one of these days while we're collecting information, a few of us should run off to the encampment.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so I need to finalize. What is the plan?

[Speaker 2]
Silk wants to shut down the gate so that the bad rulers don't send their armies through.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, you already know what I want to do.

[Speaker 3]
I specifically wanted to go here. One, disable it. Either disable it so that nobody can use it or just get rid of all the people so that she and...

[Speaker 6]
And then your companion also wants to slay a dragon, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Kibi wants to slay the dragon.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so Kibi and Edmund at this point would be best of friends talking about, you know, the honor of battle and the things of that nature. Um, Macaroni.

[Speaker 3]
Yes?

[Speaker 6]
What's the plan? Shut it down or slay the dragon?

[Speaker 3]
Well, those aren't the only two options. We can shut it down. I mean, like I said, there's things to sabotage.

There is an entire encampment of centaurs that want this place gone. We should at least talk to them to see what they have on the place. Um, and in the meantime collect information.

[Speaker 4]
Use the dragon as evidence for why this region is too dangerous to keep up this fighting town.

[Speaker 3]
Very true, however, that counts on the dragon actually finding us. And the dragon was tracking a ship, not a few people.

[Speaker 2]
You didn't even know where the dragon's lair is.

[Speaker 3]
That was days ago, right?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I mean, it might be in the area, but, you know, the coverage on a dragon, those things, I imagine... He did say he'd be back, and you never doubt a dragon's word.

[Speaker 3]
He said he'd be back in a couple of hours, and I doubt his word because he was not back in a couple of hours.

[Speaker 6]
I don't think it's been a couple days. I don't think we'll see him again.

[Speaker 2]
He said hours, he didn't say days.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I don't think it's been a couple days.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's literally been... It's been like six days. We met him when we were on the airship heading south, and then we landed and spent six days traveling.

[Speaker 4]
So something had to have interfered, then.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there must be a zombie-rich dragon army that he's fighting! That's even more dangerous!

[Speaker 3]
We could spread rumors about a dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
It wouldn't be rumors, though.

[Speaker 3]
Exactly. It wouldn't be... well, they would be rumors, however, because nobody else saw it but us.

[Speaker 6]
We never asked.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. But there are plenty of people drowning their sorrows in booze, I'm sure. This isn't the best of jobs.

[Speaker 6]
We're gonna go to the centaur camp, we're gonna talk about a dragon, he's gonna show up and be like hey, ya miss me?

[Speaker 3]
Gonna take all the centaurs out, goddammit. I think we should definitely talk, on our to-do list for this week is talk to the centaurs, sabotage a few things, spread rumors about a dragon, hope that the dragon pops up, and yeah. Try to look into getting more information on what...

[Speaker 2]
How did we know about this place?

[Speaker 3]
Me. Charis.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but how did you know about it? Did it come to you in a dream?

[Speaker 3]
I have a contact that knew a little bit about it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, did that person tell you anything about the inner workings? Like, did they say hey, you need to shut this down, hey, we have a better use for this?

[Speaker 1]
Charis has also been spying on this place for quite some time. We're not back in game because we've got another 10-15 minutes, but...

[Speaker 3]
Do you remember what my contact told me about this place? Notes are on a little flash drive that I don't have plugged in right now.

[Speaker 1]
There's a few things. There's stuff I told you in the Pythas Pythas thing there. And if I look just...

I think in your character thread here...

[Speaker 8]
Alright, I'll be right back.

[Speaker 7]
Where's Fogato?

[Speaker 1]
Say...

[Speaker 3]
Where? I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Because this... Go ahead. This thing is like a massive artifact essentially.

This could be way, way beyond our ability to reverse engineer how to disable it or redirect it. So, we might need access to big guns, ancient sages, you know, world spirits. There might be...

We may need to have an information gathering period before we can even know whether it's possible to permanently close this or how best to interfere what the intervention would look like.

[Speaker 1]
So, as far as activating it and making it go one place over another, that's not the difficult part. Because one, Keras is aware that right now the whole reason for any of the Hypo report has to send a proxy to deal with this is because the season has not turned to winter as of yet, so they can only really stay in the frost unless they want to start taking some hefty attrition damage.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
As far as activating it, yes, it is possible. They're just missing some key component. They're just missing some key component, apparently, of opening the gates themselves.

Like, they've gained access to the area behind the gates. They're able to fire by their own admission, explore the area, but they haven't described it. The issue is just opening the literal stone gate out front is apparently a pure requisite of activating the Ysrian at all.

They've been trying to figure out whether or not it has something to do with the water spout that they found, whether it has to do something with that kind of stone that hole in the stone platform further south. But right now they're just digging and hoping that they've found the water spout marked a pretty good amount of progress, even though it damaged their operation heavily. Let's see here.

But yeah, the mummy appeared shortly thereafter and helped them fend off the centaur skirmishes, but then the skirmishes increased and such. I believe it was... It was her brother.

Is her contact.

[Speaker 3]
No, my brother is dead. The contact is...

[Speaker 2]
You killed your brother?

[Speaker 3]
No! He died on the job. That was my last day working for Pyphus.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. I gotcha. So what we might want to do with the centaurs is get them to agree to watch over...

We don't know if they're reliable or trustworthy, but there might be good guardians of the place if we can get these guys out of here and set up the teleportation network to go to a place that's beneficial for us. We might be able to get the centaurs to agree to watch over it.

[Speaker 6]
I've returned.

[Speaker 3]
What if we can convince everybody in the camp that whatever's on the other side of that gate... I'm a fairy, alright? Maybe if they believe that the gate is Fae origin, which is likely, right?

Which is correct.

[Speaker 1]
It was built by Fae.

[Speaker 3]
I have a special connection with the Woad and I can tell there is an entire army, a malicious army on the other side that wants to kill everyone. Either we can convince them to fight or we can convince them to leave.

[Speaker 2]
They might already know that though, right?

[Speaker 3]
Well, the foreman would, but everybody else who is getting paid shit money and getting injured quite often would not. They'd be pretty angry if they found out that they'd been lied to.

[Speaker 4]
Not really part of the job description.

[Speaker 3]
Exactly.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know, if they're like local people and they're being kept in the dark, the information reveal might change their minds.

[Speaker 3]
We could spread rumors and whatnot. I can help with that.

[Speaker 4]
Goodness knows that I can whisper to enough people's heads already.

[Speaker 2]
What time of day is it?

[Speaker 3]
If it's towards nightfall. Yeah, it's towards nightfall. We should find a tavern, see what we can find there.

Or wherever their drinking hole is.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's in their face.

[Speaker 1]
This contact would have been a darkling that was working for World High Fist.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Specifically under that same lieutenant, that same... Yeah, would have been under that same... under the same hag that you were directly serving.

[Speaker 3]
Right. Which I would like to kill eventually.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so if we come clean and we just say directly, hey, we're worried that something horrible is going to come through that door. We really think you shouldn't open it and no one should open it. We're kind of tipping our hand that we're not actually going to help them open it.

[Speaker 3]
So we have to wait a little bit before we can do that.

[Speaker 2]
We could do it right away and just say, hey, forget the whole playing along thing to gather more information. I'd like to play along at least for a couple days and gather more information, see what they know, see what the lay of the land is, while they're still kind of on our side and paying us money.

[Speaker 4]
Slowly seed rumors amongst them. Eventually, keep making occasional references that maybe this gate seems just a little bit strange. Almost as if it's perfect for military usage.

[Speaker 3]
The more friends we can make, the better, the more likely they are to side with us and not dismiss us. Because they could totally just dismiss us and be like, those people are liars and troublemakers. Hold on, are they racist against Fae?

Because that would be not great.

[Speaker 2]
Only the ones who know Fae.

[Speaker 3]
Why, thanks.

[Speaker 4]
Worst comes to worst, I can always fake a summoning.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so priority one, do some exploration behind this gate, see what's going on, see if there's any obvious, see how close we think they are to actually being able to open it. Priority two, seed rumors and discontent to try to sap their morale and willpower. Priority three, contact the centaurs.

Priority four, kill the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. But the dragon has to come to us. We'll have no choice if the thing comes over to us.

[Speaker 4]
Well, if the dragon doesn't end up appearing for quite some time, we can always mock down that location where we found that dragon as a potential good location for some enterprising content to come back. I believe the dragon will show. No, absolutely not.

It's good to make a note of it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the guy at this point is going to come back. I don't know if he opens soon. That'll be fine.

So at this point, the foreman is going to come back, Zacharias, and say, well, what have we decided so far? Also, I'm just going to create a shitty screen here.

[Speaker 3]
We have... Hold on. Did we decide that we wanted to get more pay for it, or did we...

Are we just going to say yes?

[Speaker 6]
The sabotage, I thought, was what we decided on.

[Speaker 4]
So I'm pretty sure we're talking about characters in front of Zacharias.

[Speaker 3]
No, this is out of character. I'm just wondering what I... It is out of character.

[Speaker 1]
You guys had an hour to discuss this, so somebody should be fucking in character.

[Speaker 4]
To be clear, I'm pretty sure we decided that we would accept the payment for now to keep going.

[Speaker 3]
We'll help. As long as we get the 30 gold out of it.

[Speaker 4]
Money's money.

[Speaker 1]
I'll even start you off with an advance given that it kept us from it kept us from it kept us from dying there. That was quite nice of you.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. I can't imagine if I had started spelling any time later.

[Speaker 4]
It likely wouldn't have gone well.

[Speaker 3]
Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just going to... Like, Lucent's just going to pipe up. Do you know where the fellows injured from that tornado would be?

I've got a bit of a gift from my heritage. Pyramid at this point.

[Speaker 3]
It's in the pyramid.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's a mummy board.

[Speaker 6]
Question, have you seen a dragon in these parts?

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea what that fucking thing is.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know what that is.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways. Okay, so we're talking about dragons now?

[Speaker 6]
Yes. There was one flying around here. Maybe you've seen it?

[Speaker 1]
Around here? I feel like we would have noticed that there was.

[Speaker 6]
And this is a deception, by the way. I'm trying to deceive and spread a rumor.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make a deception check.

[Speaker 6]
Where is my deception? I've rolled.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, nine.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Are you? Okay.

First rule here. No shit-stirring. We've had a hard time as is.

I don't want to have to deal with any fights. I really don't want to have to deal with people starting trouble, so keep a leash on the dog here. Second thing is that we're not primarily interested at this point in having you do a ton of archaeology, though you are free to spend your free time doing it as such.

At the moment, our biggest cost or, well, yeah. Our biggest cost are the different creatures that seem to love harassing and raiding us. Just a few days ago, one of my There's a pond that we've set up here.

Everybody come over this way. It takes you guys out back to show you and look over the excavation pit. And there is a water spout with a phenomenal upwards pressure.

It's probably about 200 feet down to the very bottom of the excavation pit where this water spout is. There's a makeshift pipe attached to it. It is shooting up this pipe and going even further, and arcing over the edge of the excavation site.

It's so fast. That's currently what we use to take out trash, garbage, and we throw mud and dirt into it to just carry it over the site. It's been fantastic.

The problem is we need there's now a pond just kind of filling up next to it, so we've had some of the ettins going out and shoveling away there. And that was going okay at first, but now something keeps attacking them. They said it was a worm, but there's no sign of a worm large enough to attack my fucking ettins.

[Speaker 4]
So really no one's out there. The visibility or perhaps some method of controlling the ground.

[Speaker 6]
We could go check.

[Speaker 1]
That might be one of the things that I have you do first. Then, of course, there's the fact that there's the centaurs that we have around here. We were in peace talks for a little while there.

They're invested in, as invested in seeing the east organ open as we are, but they've taken the shooting. They never shot the workers lethally, if that makes sense. It would just be something that went into the side flesh of the thigh, and that would suck, but they wouldn't die.

But ever since these hetercaps, spiders and scorpions showed up brought by our neighbor, they've taken the shooting to kill, so I can't even take my men off off site here. They haven't shot me, but I would like it if somebody they haven't shot any of the other rat catchers around, but I would like it if somebody could go and speak in my place to them and kind of secure some kind of peace deal.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure we could we could totally do that, right guys?

[Speaker 4]
We could certainly try. I'm more interested in the supposed worm.

[Speaker 3]
But first, I need bedding and a place to rest.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, we'll show you to our quarters and then we'll have a full set of jobs ready.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a tavern?

[Speaker 1]
There's a commissary area, but that's closed at the moment.

[Speaker 2]
You have a problem.

[Speaker 3]
It's not a drinking problem. Thank you very much. I do have a problem, though.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so set this here. I don't know how to get rid of this little stupid message pop-up. Messages.

There's messages? There's this little pop-up that says, Sahara approves. It's hilarious, don't get me wrong.

I just don't know how to get rid of it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna copy this thing that you put in out of character and put it in the Discord.

[Speaker 5]
What types the messages thingy? Oh, sorry, what module is it even from? It's so-and-so.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's called somebody approved of this or somebody like this. I'll have to check.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. Sahara approves.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I didn't get the spelling quite right on that. I had Y-S-R I-G-A-N. That's E-G-G-E-N.

Okay. And what was the worm connection?

[Speaker 1]
Worm connection was just something that Ettin said that they were getting bitten by worms.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Can we tell if he was saying Y or W-O or W-Y? A wyrm versus a worm?

Like ground worms.

[Speaker 3]
Gross.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, now it's gross.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's gross.

[Speaker 4]
Watch this turn out to be actually just tremors.

[Speaker 2]
That would be pretty awesome.

[Speaker 1]
That's what they were complaining about.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Damn. So I guess just rest?

I'll spend a hit die of healing. This would be a long rest, I think. Well, you can't use the long rest mechanic because it uses the full-on healing thing.

Like the base 5E will.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see.

[Speaker 4]
Suppose I just recover my abilities. So we get back our scholarly dice? Class dice, rather?

Remember, you get class dice back from choosing that instead of hit dice.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll choose that instead of getting back the path to hit dice. So, back to full, I guess.

[Speaker 5]
Before we sleep, Vardy will gather you all up and he will use his power and brace the deep. We can all have a dig speed if we want. We also don't have to breathe.

Lovely. How long does this last? 24 hours, so.

Oh, good.

[Speaker 4]
I'm actually very curious as to what is that class.

[Speaker 5]
It's Matt Colville's The Talent. He released it last year, I think. It's a psionic-based caster, essentially where he's made his own spell progression, I guess, is the way to describe it, in which every time I use...

Yeah, every time I use a power that's higher than the equivalent of a cantrip, I have to make a test. And if I roll under the power's order level, I take strain, which accumulates in things. So if I take one strain, I can either take disadvantage on strength or dex checks, or can't take the dash, disengage, or dodge actions, or disadvantage on wisdom, charisma checks.

So that's the first one, and you can... If I take over 12 strain, I die.

[Speaker 3]
Damn! Sounds fun.

[Speaker 5]
Huh.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so, I guess you can always roll.

[Speaker 8]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
There's a few other ratcatchers in the area who introduce themselves mostly low-level, or, like, kind of secondary-class characters.

[Speaker 3]
Really friendly?

[Speaker 1]
...towards prospectors. Oh, there's... Some of them try to, like, learn your names, and, like, people tend to drift out of here pretty quickly.

It's good for some easy cash if you're just traveling by and you want to do some prospecting out west, but, you know, people aren't really making a lot of progress here, and... I don't really like the look of that pyramid.

[Speaker 3]
Can we ask some of the lower-level people that we're bunking with about the pyramid? See what they know about it.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. There's a... gnome here named Beechus.

What do you... What do you want to know?

[Speaker 3]
Uh... How long has it been here? Why'd you set up next to it?

[Speaker 1]
Well, Charis would know that. It's been here for about...

[Speaker 3]
two...

[Speaker 1]
no, sorry. It's been here for about... What's that session?

I think it's been here for about six months. Six... Huh.

Yeah, that's when you guys had the hollow... That's when you guys fought in the hollow plea of claim.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Why do they bring the injured there? What's the point of that?

[Speaker 1]
What's the point of bringing injured people there? Well, they're, you know... They're injured.

We don't really have the best resources to take care of them. There's not as many healers hanging out here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, looks like... I can help out at least one person per day. Yeah, they're not really interested in having the healers do that stuff.

[Speaker 1]
They just want to... Like, somebody... Like, don't get me wrong.

If I get injured, I expect you to help me because I don't want to go into the... Of course!

[Speaker 3]
We look after our own. Oh, sure. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And yeah, anybody who has any kind of a healing ability, they usually keep them close at hand for healing up the ends more often, or keeping ready for, like, in case of an attack. So, if you could send the wounded to the pyramid in, like, normal circumstances for just kind of, like, work-related injuries, then that's whatever, but you can only really use... The pyramid doesn't help us if we're under attack, so that's why I guess you got the...

That's why they would have you, like, save your spells and such.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Has anyone looked into the worms?

[Speaker 1]
Worms? I think it's nonsense. I think something's probably playing a trick on the poor bastards.

[Speaker 4]
Still, something's attacking them.

[Speaker 1]
I know those... I got a brief look at them just as they were coming back. I was out prospecting.

I've actually worked with this company before, but have to say hi again. Those ends are pretty tough. It looked like they had scratched their own legs.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I dug into them pretty deep. I didn't see anything that looked like bite marks, but, you know, he had a Friday safety briefing anyway, so... Just in case.

[Speaker 3]
Speaking of people working here, I wouldn't happen to, like, recognize anybody, would I? From my days as working for him?

[Speaker 1]
No, because the... Let's see here. At this point...

[Speaker 3]
It's been, like, a year, but...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay, so I want somebody to make me an insight check. And then...

So, where do you guys... How do you guys, like, wrap up for the night? Are you in your jammies?

Do you guys sleep with your rifles?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, probably, like, a rifle next to me, a rifle next to... Haleth. Sleeping, probably, like, bunked next to each other.

Maybe, like, over-under. If there's bunk beds. Silk does want to kind of look around at the other ratcatchers, and see what kind of gear they have.

And see if there's any, like, magic items or anything. He's a little bit worried about adventurers either stealing his stuff, or being evil and unreliable. He kind of wants to know what he's up against.

It's like a 10 from Vati.

[Speaker 1]
Vati, you see that Beechus is kind of, like, looking off to the side there. Not really making eye contact. But if he's looking at something specific, he can actually tell.

And this is the moment at which... Go ahead and make me a perception check. Silk.

You see a little glint in the scope of your rifle.

[Speaker 2]
Boy, okay, I'll... Is the scope detachable or not? I don't know.

I'll probably have to... If I start pointing my gun around at people, it's going to look pretty weird. I'll kind of, like, pretend like I'm cleaning it.

You know? And, like, sighting down it. But using that as an excuse to look around and try to see what that glint was.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. There is a scrying eye directly above Hebe. And it disappears.

The second one appears about 30 seconds later above Paris. And then that disappears.

[Speaker 2]
I'll cast Whisper a few times, and I'll tell each of the party members separately about what I saw. I'm trying to keep it, like, if someone's scrying, they'll have to be listening very closely to over here.

[Speaker 4]
Honestly, I should probably make it a habit of having my guy, like, constantly repeat the bonus action telepathy link.

[Speaker 5]
I can do a similar telepathic link. It's sort of like Rari's telepathic bond that lasts for an hour between the five of us. I can do that five times a day.

So we can talk secretly. Like, if we get too far away, does it stop? I think it's on this plane before the hour ends.

Communication is possible over any distance, so it can't extend to other planes of existence.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, while that is happening, Lucent would ask if you could briefly go up to the pyramid and heal one person before he goes to take a rest.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody so far has been pretty insistent about, like, no, you may not go into the pyramid unless you're injured.

[Speaker 3]
I wonder why.

[Speaker 4]
Interesting.

[Speaker 3]
But we're being watched. So let's probably remember that.

[Speaker 4]
They're probably trying to vet us. Makes sense. Makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
I should mention the Keras that they have been... I'm presuming the Keras has been disguised since their original tenure at Pythas. Like, they have a changed appearance and they have a literally changed name.

They're getting recognized by Fades.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, my name back when I was working for Pythas was completely different from Keras, so... Keras is a new name. They would not recognize that name.

[Speaker 1]
You were gonna see an eye roll if you said it out loud.

[Speaker 3]
Does it matter what it was? Because it's never gonna be used again.

[Speaker 1]
So. Hmm. The night will pass uneventfully.

You guys wake up in the morning. You guys receive a small spreadsheet of assignments. Potential assignments, and the rat catchers get to pick.

They're just kind of lounging around and getting ready to get to work. It seems like most of them prefer to go to the mess hall on the second. This is on the upper working quarters at this point.

Slide out so you can see a little bit more now. There's been a bunch of runoff going down to the bottom excavation area. Some wooden support struts have been set to support the very lowest working quarters because they've been, like, they're listing and they're about to fall off.

And around your orientation, basically, impromptu orientation from the rest of your co-workers here, they would have told you, hey, try to be careful if you're on the lowest working quarters. They're trying to build some support pillars to go up there, but it's kind of slow going. It's gonna take us another, probably gonna take us another five days here.

We just don't want anybody starting another mudslide.

[Speaker 3]
Another?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. They're a little bit more common ever since the water table's up. And obviously, we've got the water spout.

We're using that all the time. And we didn't really have enough clay to kind of make an embankment, so that's, we think that's slowly seeping down and going back under. Gotta get this, we gotta get these things secure by the next rain, but we'll leave that to the engineers.

On your assignment sheet for different options that you can take is, like, hazard. There's negotiating with the centaurs. There is figuring out what's going hunting for whatever's attacking.

The ettins out by the pond. There's a few minor tasks, like Please don't know. There's a few minor tasks, like helping shore up the water spout runoff so that it doesn't actually flood the excavation site.

And then there's minor tasks for, like, hey, investigate the eaves rigging, try to figure out what goes inside this hole, blah blah blah. And there's a few more tasks, like, take the I guess the last task on there would be take the edder caps on a raid.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you're raiding.

[Speaker 1]
It just says, it has a little it has a little star next to it that one of your co-workers will explain. That one's from the from the decide to take this one. Well, if nobody takes this one, then somebody's going to be selected.

But if you decide to take this one and there's an audience with him, most people leave after they do an assignment.

[Speaker 3]
Do they now?

[Speaker 6]
I say we go do this raid.

[Speaker 3]
So I have so far negotiate with centaurs, investigate the edden worms, mummy instructed raid. Is that a good way to phrase it?

[Speaker 1]
Specifically taking the edder caps and they're taking the edder caps and they're edder caps or eddens? edder caps. There's a little spidery guys who can control spiders and scorpions to some extent.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they're kind of like centaurs, but spiders.

[Speaker 1]
You're thinking of driders. Edder caps are even more disgusting.

[Speaker 3]
What are they? What do they look like?

[Speaker 5]
They're like humanoid spiders, essentially. They have full limbs, but they have like a spider face.

[Speaker 1]
Who's dying? Probably nobody tonight. We'll see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, they walk on their winged legs.

[Speaker 5]
I'm curious about the worms.

[Speaker 3]
I know I missed something. So I got negotiate with centaurs, investigate the edden worms, mummy instructed raid with the edder caps. What else?

[Speaker 1]
Investigate the platform hole and shore up the water spout.

[Speaker 3]
Something about the water spout? Water spout. I don't know what we're doing with it, but I'm putting it.

[Speaker 1]
I put it in the out of character chat.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, wonderful. Copy and paste it.

[Speaker 5]
The in character chat stopped working for me.

[Speaker 1]
Really?

[Speaker 5]
I don't see anything and it just has the prompt jump to bottom and I try to use it. It just posted an out of character chat for me.

[Speaker 2]
It's because there's no token. When you speak in character, it speaks with whatever token you have selected.

[Speaker 1]
Speaking of which, go ahead and drag your tokens onto this area. Tell me what it is you're doing. Like I said, the character is going to be spending a while here most likely, unless you want to blow things up right now, which I'm totally fine with.

But yeah, it's going to be I'm totally fine with a slow burn right now.

[Speaker 4]
I guess figuring out how to get the most out of the situation.

[Speaker 3]
We could investigate those worms. I'm kind of grossed out at that. Eager to see what that is.

Neither of my characters are particularly excited to encounter worms. But maybe it's illusion magic.

[Speaker 4]
Or it could be some form of terrain manipulation to hide the signs.

[Speaker 2]
I think Silk is interested in trying to steal from some of the fellow rat catchers.

[Speaker 3]
We do have eyes watching us.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but Silk can be invisible. I could punch eye.

[Speaker 3]
Did I remind you that we need these people on our side?

[Speaker 6]
Wait, we do?

[Speaker 3]
Since we're going to be sleeping in their presence.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so I'll just try to keep an eye out for anything that's like rare or above quality magic items held by any of the adventurers.

[Speaker 3]
Just don't get caught. You are a rogue, right?

[Speaker 2]
I am a rogue. And I specialize in illusion magic.

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful, I will keep that in mind.

[Speaker 5]
I think we've voted for the worms with the majority at this point. Let's do worms.

[Speaker 3]
Worms it is, then.

[Speaker 2]
Is this something we're all doing together as a party or are we sort of expected to split up and handle...

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it's a good idea to split up.

[Speaker 1]
You guys get more done obviously you guys get more done splitting up. But you get things done faster if you go out this way.

[Speaker 3]
We have five tasks and we're going to be here for a week. Ideally we do maybe one or two tasks a day, we can get through them.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Let's do it.

[Speaker 6]
The question is, what do we start with? Worms.

[Speaker 4]
Worms.

[Speaker 1]
That's not a question, that's just a matter of paying attention. Alright, so you guys start progressing outwards. One of the foremen at this point is really not handling anything related to your day-to-day operations.

It's usually another ratcatcher or a trusted engineer who's talking to you. In this case, it's one of the hobgoblins that's in charge of muscle around the property, around the excavation. This guy is Zechariah's second-in-command.

He just introduces himself as Rags. Alright, I would like a... Here's the thing, the ends are a little bit easy to startle sometimes, so I don't really know what's out there, but we need them out digging again instead.

So we need something helping us. I can either have you go on a hunt right now, but then we're getting a little too close for comfort there as far as the water goes. I don't want that water spilling over the excavation here, or I can send the...

have you guys guard the ends while they go out and dig. I prefer to do that. The boss has instructed me to let you do whatever you want here, so that's your options.

[Speaker 5]
Guarding the ends seems pretty straightforward.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I appreciate that. Out of curiosity, do any of you have healing magic? Just a little mild thing once per day.

Not much. Here's the thing, if any of the ettins get bumped up or scratched up too bad, either heal them, or hide them in a safe place for a little while. I haven't sent any of my ettins out to the pyramid as of yet.

Every time I talk with them or remarks on a surprise to you is that such hardy creatures haven't had native services yet, so I would just prefer to keep it that way for now. I appreciate it. Alright, it is about a 20 minute walk around the pond itself, in order to get around to the other side where the ettins have been digging.

They follow along, they're just kind of fairly cheery, whistling. After a little bit of whistling from one head, the other one starts. Sometimes the other one smacks the- sometimes one head smacks the other, that can indicate a change of turn.

They start whistling at the same time, it's completely out of tune, but you know, they're just kind of going about their day.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, this is cringing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they just have shovels ready with them. Two per ettin. And you make it to the embankment that they've nearly cut through to this side.

It's probably going to take another week's worth of- a week's worth of pretty hard work, but if they get there, they'll be able to they'll be able to completely drain this section of the pond, and just have the waterspout run 24-7 at least for a little while longer. They start getting to work. For something like this, I would just have you guys...

What materials do you guys have as far as, like, standing guard, or setting traps, or keeping an eye out for things? A lot more going out and trying to track down whatever you're looking for. I'm worried about it, because I'm watching you out of the corner of my eye.

I said, no. That's the whole point of the corner of my eye. Anyways, that's definitely going to happen.

Yeah, so either looking for either looking for these creatures, or standing watch over the ettins, or asking them questions, or trying to track these critters down. I'll be listening. You're free to discuss this with us.

[Speaker 2]
Well, Silk and Hollith are probably going to be tracking. That's sort of Hollith's speciality.

[Speaker 4]
Very fair.

[Speaker 6]
Edmund will smash anything he don't like.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to talk to the ettins.

[Speaker 4]
I will also be talking with them.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not going to lie, I have no idea what to do with Garrus in this situation. She can't fly. She's got an instrument.

And not much else.

[Speaker 5]
Artic Inspiration is helpful for anyone, really.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
If you go with Edmund, we'd be split up in twos then, in case we get caught out by worms.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, who am I going with?

[Speaker 5]
Edmund, is it?

[Speaker 3]
Can we just put ourselves into little groups? What is he doing? Barbarian over here.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no one's tokens have their names anymore except for Silk's and mine.

[Speaker 2]
You have to change your default token setting, otherwise you have to set those settings every time you put it down.

[Speaker 3]
Always for everyone. So Kibi's going to be standing watch, ready to smash shit.

[Speaker 6]
How do you set the default?

[Speaker 5]
It's on your character sheet at the top. Character sheet at the top?

[Speaker 2]
It's like a prototype token button. Oh. All the settings you apply there will be what your token comes out with when you drag it.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. It was Lysantha that was going to come talk to the Atins, right? Yeah, because I have a really high persuasion.

Very good.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe Kaer should do that as well because she also does. Not seeing Unless it's a one-man job because they are just Atins.

[Speaker 5]
Like they aren't gonna I doubt they'll like try and deceive us or anything. I don't think we'll need help with the Atins.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So who's standing watch?

[Speaker 5]
Edmund was going to stand watch, ready to smack ones, I think.

[Speaker 4]
We'll stay with you. I'm not seeing the prototype thing.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Open character sheet should be at the top.

[Speaker 5]
Right next to pop out.

[Speaker 2]
Right next to sheet, prototype token, pop out. Right next to close.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, pop out. Oh. What?

[Speaker 1]
Foundry has a very simple tutorial on this as well. Not sure exactly where it is.

[Speaker 4]
Already. Oh, there you are. I found the prototype thing.

There we go. There. That should always be displaying it now.

[Speaker 3]
Silk and yeah. Silk, what are you?

[Speaker 2]
I'm tracking with Haleth, but I think he automatically succeeds on anything 20 or less.

[Speaker 4]
I'll be talking to the Atins and all that.

[Speaker 2]
Let me double check that. It's a tracker thing.

[Speaker 5]
I guess Charis can stand watch.

[Speaker 3]
Charis will stand watch, just kind of watching. Probably not going to be smashing anything.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me a check to track something.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Lucent and Vati are currently here. Charis, Edmund, and Kibi are currently out discarding the local area. Lucent and Vati are talking to the Atins.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Would you like to save them? I want to try to find out their perspective on what happened.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Try to cross reference.

[Speaker 1]
Use both heads at once. It kind of makes me a little bit hungry. Yeah, me too.

I don't really like it. It's really good. I'll see if I can help you, unless I got some grout to chew on.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, I mean their perspective like the weird worm thing. Yeah, that is their search.

[Speaker 5]
How about we buy you some dinner later when we get back if you help us now? Surely that will help things go more smoothly.

[Speaker 3]
You flirt.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, go ahead and make me a persuasion check. Can I give an advantage through the help action? Sure.

[Speaker 5]
Advantage, you say? Yes, please.

[Speaker 1]
Why am I rolling so badly tonight? It's okay. Fourteen would succeed.

Alright, we're going to hold you to it. We're out here. Right?

We're digging and there's another surge of water, like something jumped into it. And I get waves around my shins. And when I look down there's a worm off to the side and there's a bunch of little suckums stuck through my shins.

And I could feel them and then I ripped the tentacles off and I threw them to the ground. I felt pretty good, but I could still feel the wriggling inside my shins. And I started trying to get at them.

It was a while before they went away.

[Speaker 5]
How big was the worm?

[Speaker 1]
No, the worm was huge. It was like ten, three, five of me long plus him. Five of me and then one of him.

Huh.

[Speaker 5]
Was it a certain color, like purple, perhaps?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, it was purple.

[Speaker 5]
Can I do a nature check on purple?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. You could do, yeah, you could do a nature check on purple.

[Speaker 5]
Not rolling garbage, doesn't matter. Can I also make one?

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, anything that I have you guys at this point with you would be able to make checks? 2d6 scholar dice.

[Speaker 3]
I wish I was smart enough to know what this is.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are rolling large shift today, that's fine. That's fine, so 15, you're like, well, purple worms don't really have tentacles and they definitely don't deposit their young and the purple worm finally could probably swallow one of these things whole. Yeah.

Perhaps a distant cousin. Also, I can't quite hear you.

[Speaker 4]
Perhaps a distant cousin. Did you hear that? Yeah, I heard.

Okay. Just like Lucid is like audibly like thinking to himself, just, you know, like if it's a distant cousin of like purple worm.

[Speaker 5]
And you said it was like something dove in the water and caused the flooding to raise?

[Speaker 1]
It was a big surge and the puddle went out. The whole reason I turned away to begin with was I saw a big old wave and it wanted to knock me over.

[Speaker 5]
This is finally giving me more questions.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe leeches?

[Speaker 1]
Kibi, Charis, and Edmund are there so you can make some skill checks while you're listening to the story.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, let's see if Nature let's see if Kibi has heard of this in any song or story. Nope. Not a damn clue.

[Speaker 5]
Eventually we'll roll above 10.

[Speaker 4]
Like, I rolled terribly for my scholar dice.

[Speaker 5]
Two ones. This is the session, the dice win. I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so nothing really comes to mind. The story just kind of seems a little bit weird and a little bit like a fever dream.

[Speaker 7]
Practically unbelievable.

[Speaker 3]
Could it be illusion?

[Speaker 1]
If you've got anything else for us here, I'm now really starting to get on. I'd like to get back to thinking to take my mind off of.

[Speaker 5]
No, no, get back to work. Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, thank you. Thank you for the information.

[Speaker 3]
Is anyone in this little group? I'm assuming at least one of you has like a proficiency in arcana. Could there be illusion magic or just any magic really around?

Just check around the ground and whatnot.

[Speaker 1]
I need to know a little bit more about what you're asking. Like, how are you checking for illusion magic?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, any weird glows or...

[Speaker 1]
The illusion magic is weird when it's like there.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. Never mind then.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. The tech magic doesn't reveal anything magical nearby.

[Speaker 4]
One interesting thing though is that my mage hand because telekinetic is invisible so I'll just have my like hand like occasionally like searching the ground like seeing if there's something there shouldn't be there.

[Speaker 1]
There's... But you have to like direct it, it's not intelligent.

[Speaker 4]
Like what's something that you would be looking for? Just like basically like trying to like check the ground to see if like it feels like there's something moving there or something.

[Speaker 1]
Like testing it to see if anything is underneath the...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like checking for tunnels and stuff?

[Speaker 1]
Like poking to see if anything's under there right now?

[Speaker 4]
I guess. Yeah. I was more like thinking like maybe like maybe like the worms might be like...

Because my current thought is that maybe the worms might be like invisible under certain circumstances so like maybe like try to use something physically to sense them out instead of just using eyesight.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright. Maybe...

Ah, nothing. Nothing comes up there.

[Speaker 5]
Do the Ettens have any scars or anything from where the worms bit their shins and laid little worms inside their skin?

[Speaker 1]
They just have little scratch marks on their shins themselves. Or sorry, they were covered by bandages but they took them off to work in the water here.

[Speaker 3]
See that's what makes me think it might be illusionary. Or illusitory. I don't know the word.

You know what I mean.

[Speaker 5]
How deep is the water we're in currently?

[Speaker 1]
Or are they in the water? It's like they're in the water. And you're I guess off to the side just kind of where they're digging.

But yeah, there's and you can see pretty clearly there's just like scratch marks and stuff like that but there's no invisible sign of no visible sign of puncture wounds besides that.

[Speaker 5]
What are the Ettens doing exactly? They're just digging clay? Are they moving clay?

Is that what they're...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they're trying to forward a new path to lower ground so this bedded runoff pond can actually can go somewhere else instead of spilling over the side of the excavation.

[Speaker 5]
Would it be any help for us to use our burrowing speed that I gave us from Embrace the Deep? Or are they already doing this as quickly as possible because they're giants?

[Speaker 1]
Burrowing speed... I'll ping it again. I don't think the burrowing would help you much because it's just going to fill back up with water.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
You have to get the dirt somewhere else. It's around this time that the... just go tracks, yeah.

It's about like 10-30 in the morning. At this point, one of the Ettens stands up straight and is like OK, boss. And starts moving back towards...

Just moving back towards the excavation site. The one still with you is OK, boss. Just keeps digging.

Rez, are you here?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, I'm here.

[Speaker 1]
OK, go ahead and make me a wisdom saving throw.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. That's a check. Oh, nice.

[Speaker 1]
Edmund just gets ready to start off to the... Edmund starts moving off in the direction of the pyramid.

[Speaker 8]
I'm just going to go over and just like say where are you going to over there?

[Speaker 4]
The worms remember.

[Speaker 3]
He is moving along. Does he look under control of himself?

[Speaker 8]
I don't think so. OK.

[Speaker 5]
Is Edmund going the same way as the Ettens?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. Ettens is going back to the excavation pit.

[Speaker 5]
Right, OK.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to dart over there. I'm just going to move you guys this way.

[Speaker 8]
Oh boy. There you guys are. The Ettens is moving off towards...

How can I move this? Left Alt instantly drags something.

[Speaker 1]
The Ettens is moving back to... Wait, what? Do you say Alt?

[Speaker 5]
Left Alt. If you hold that while you drag something, it's instant.

[Speaker 1]
I got it. Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
You're welcome.

[Speaker 1]
Right now, Edmund is moving towards the pyramid, whereas the Ettens is moving towards the water spout.

[Speaker 4]
OK, gotcha. Does it look like Edmund's charmed right now?

[Speaker 5]
He looks charmed. Edmund, come back! Alright.

[Speaker 4]
A funny thing about... That is... Comma motions.

[Speaker 8]
OK.

[Speaker 4]
Right there.

[Speaker 8]
Perfect. Good job. We all have to make that save.

No more charmed.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's just...

[Speaker 6]
Edmund, go ahead and make me a wisdom save.

[Speaker 4]
Charisma. Sorry, charisma save. Oh, well, yeah.

And no more charmed.

[Speaker 1]
So the suggestion effect is currently no longer on him. You guys are a little bit of a distance at this point away from the... At least Lucent is...

Lucent and Edmund are a distance away from the Ettens.

[Speaker 8]
What the hell was that? Uh...

[Speaker 4]
I just had to suppress the charm effect.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so Edmund, Lucent, and... whoever else is with them. Edmund, you heard a suggestion to just go to the pyramid and knock on the door.

Or sorry, go to the pyramid and break the door down.

[Speaker 6]
I relay this to the party. Like, a voice in my head told me to break down the door to the pyramid.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
And honestly, it might be a good idea.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but it concerns me that something just tried to force you to...

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna look around.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe you had no other choice.

[Speaker 3]
Do I see anybody that looks like they're slightly disappointed now?

[Speaker 5]
It could be some kind of aberration that's in the water.

[Speaker 1]
Keep in mind, right now, Lucent and Edmund are further away from the party. Edmund was walking for about, like, three minutes.

[Speaker 5]
The party's gonna run off to the Ettens and that's heading back towards the spout.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, and where is the rest of the party right now?

[Speaker 8]
Um... Ah. Ah.

[Speaker 1]
It's down this way.

[Speaker 8]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
Monty is running off after the other end. Monty is running off after the end that's headed towards the spout, right?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Correct. Which means you guys have 30 seconds.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, Kiwi is going to grab Charis and we're gonna run over here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm. I turn to the party, I'm like, let's just go break it down.

[Speaker 3]
Um, I can... Uh, no. I don't think you'd be able to.

It's made of onyx.

[Speaker 1]
Spell ends and the charm on Edmund resumes.

[Speaker 4]
Dammit, alright. Oh, they just cast it again? No.

[Speaker 1]
On the motion, let's see here. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When the spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that duration has not expired in the meantime.

[Speaker 3]
Are we in water right now? Or like in weird terrain right now? I thought you guys were kind of like adjacent.

[Speaker 1]
There's little inlets into the water. This is not like exactly representative.

[Speaker 3]
If I do that, sleep. Cast sleep. Just knock this motherfucker out.

[Speaker 1]
What level are you casting it at?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, oh, that is a great question.

[Speaker 6]
You're not gonna be able to.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Can you cast it at 9th level?

[Speaker 6]
Nah, come on, try. Just try.

[Speaker 3]
It's gonna go to 9th level. I'm not.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, can you beat a 117?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, but yeah, I don't think I could.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, maybe. Remember, sleep has dumb targeting. It goes for lowest first.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just gonna keep rolling. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there's two good rolls in there. Yeah, I don't think it would knock out Edmund. Okay, he's got another two minutes before he goes over there.

I'm gonna pause for a moment so that I can catch it. Uh, you have called up to the Ettin.

[Speaker 5]
I just call out, Ettin, where are you going? Can you understand me?

[Speaker 1]
I gotta do something. Also wants me to dig in a different spot.

[Speaker 5]
Where exactly? What other spot?

[Speaker 1]
Right here. He's pretty close to the waterline at this point. He's pretty close to the excavation at this point.

And he starts digging downwards, just kind of into the water, and starts slopping mud off to the side.

[Speaker 5]
Now, Vaati hasn't done a lot of manual labor in his life. This doesn't look this doesn't look productive, right?

[Speaker 1]
Not really.

[Speaker 5]
Um, is there anything hiding in the water near the spout? How close are we to the actual spout?

[Speaker 1]
He's in relatively shallow water because he's close to the end of the um, so this is the point at which the spout um, it basically falls off in pressure, finally, here, and starts arcing and landing right about where he is. And he keeps digging and digging, so his, like, barely his feet are covered by the water.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to use my, um, read thoughts again. I'm going to heighten it to third order. So, I did it wrong before.

He only needs because I'm heightening it, he has to do the intelligence save this time. And I get to learn, um, one thing that looms large in their mind. That is, I take three strain.

It's not good.

[Speaker 1]
His suggestion was, I have to dig until I find the hole.

[Speaker 8]
And it's just going back and forth in his mind. I have to dig until I find the hole. I have to dig until I find the hole.

I think Lisson's just out of the radius.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee will shove you.

[Speaker 4]
I'm right, like, just barely within a...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Keebee will shove you, don't worry.

[Speaker 1]
This is, this is in different directions. I don't know what you guys are... Okay, so...

[Speaker 5]
Can I do an arcana check on how to break a charm? Hmm. I don't have a means to break it.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so breaking a charm is like either suppressing it or dispelling it. You can charm the person themselves or you can harm the caster. Either breaking concentration or going to another condition of offering them another saving throw.

Okay, so Evan at this point is about two minutes away once Monty wraps up there from getting to the pyramid. What is the party doing? And then Soap, go ahead and make me a tracking check.

I'll get you caught up here.

[Speaker 3]
I have no idea what to do. I'm inclined to kind of just see what happens because I really don't know what to do.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, Silk. Huh?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so don't find anything that your tracker wouldn't have found with this. Because the tracker had to find a 20.

[Speaker 2]
What do your tracking eyes see?

[Speaker 1]
Hey, boss, I got nothing here. I can't even know. The guy said that he ripped the tentacles off of a monster and threw him down, but I can't even see any signs of a struggle.

I definitely don't see the tentacles around here. And I thought I saw footprints further back, but...

[Speaker 2]
All right, well, keep your eyes peeled. We'll stay on the lookout. Edge of the knife.

Tip of the spear.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi grapples, Edmund. Okay, that's a good idea. A whole, just a whole, like...

[Speaker 2]
Is that versus athletics?

[Speaker 4]
Or athletics. Question. So, I'm going to assume that the sleep sphere is actually quite a bit further away than it would be.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to assume that the sleep sphere is not actually happening. I don't think it's actually happening.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I'm not actually asleep, then. All right.

[Speaker 5]
It wouldn't affect you anyway, it all would've got wasted on Edmund.

[Speaker 4]
No, because he killed the lowest person. But we're not holding any HP.

[Speaker 1]
Let's not get distracted. So... Okay, I need you guys to make me a contested athletics check.

Edmund has the option of using an axe to try to avoid it. That's rough.

[Speaker 3]
God dammit!

[Speaker 1]
Kiwi goes for the tackle and misses.

[Speaker 3]
Just falls on the floor.

[Speaker 1]
Edmund is now one minute away. Just a light jog.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna... I have command. Command.

Does that seem like a waste to use? Command to... sit.

[Speaker 6]
You really are treating me like a fucking dog. I've rolled all of that once in my wisdom. He sits.

[Speaker 1]
That's not a nat 1. That just means that you failed it. In the new...

thing there. Yeah, so... Edmund sits for a turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Alright. Edmund, listen to me.

Look at me in the eyes. Alright? Stop!

You don't know what you're doing!

[Speaker 4]
He's charmed.

[Speaker 3]
I have any...

[Speaker 6]
Edmund is free to get up and continue moving.

[Speaker 3]
Ugh! Edmund, stop!

[Speaker 4]
I kind of pushed you aside. Edmund is charmed. That's why I put up that comma motions.

[Speaker 1]
Monty, at this point, the ettin that you are currently guarding sinks into the ground. Rip.

[Speaker 5]
Does he give up or is he still trying to dig? What's he doing?

[Speaker 1]
He's like, huh, alright, I think... And you see him, like, kind of, like, wake up. He's like, huh.

Oh, um... I found it.

[Speaker 5]
I found the hole. Can I see the hole or is he just...

[Speaker 1]
I mean, he's waist deep in it.

[Speaker 5]
Is there anything beyond what he has dug? Or is he just in a hole of his own creation?

[Speaker 1]
If you walk up closer to him, he's like, um... It looks like there's a pocket or tunnel that's been dug here.

[Speaker 5]
How did you... Who told you about this tunnel, ettin?

[Speaker 1]
It sounded like Rags.

[Speaker 5]
What? Who's Rags?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's the hobgoblin who sent you guys out here. I don't know if you were there for that. The foreman's second-in-command is a hobgoblin named Rags.

[Speaker 5]
Can you get out of the hole? Do you need help?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, that'll be fine. So he just pushes down and starts pushing more dirt down to get out of this hole and a bunch of the water starts backfilling into the hole here. Such that now the water itself is now a little bit closer to the excavation point.

Or to the excavation zone. At this point, any last minute things that you guys would like to do Can I grapple again? You can try to grapple again, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Keebee Athletics Please don't net one of it.

[Speaker 1]
You successfully grappled him about 60 feet away from the pyramid.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We're out of this section now. Does it change anything?

Can I bap him on the head or something?

[Speaker 1]
At the moment, he's just grappled.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Keebee, uh, not Keebee.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to get back to you in a moment.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Charis can do something, and then Lucent can do something, and then Silk. Ettin, you come back to find that your party has scattered and wander off and there's only one Ettin left digging here. Who begins screaming and clutching at his legs.

I can hear that, right?

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are about five minutes away but you could hear it. According to a recent a very recent discussion on Despo. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to be rushing towards the scream. Alright, you'll arrive there in two and a half minutes.

[Speaker 3]
Charis is going to punch Edmund.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Just to see if that will snap them out of it.

[Speaker 1]
It's not a string. It will not snap them out of it.

[Speaker 3]
It will not snap them out of it.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know what to do.

[Speaker 3]
Don't want to, like, stab him. That's counterproductive.

[Speaker 1]
That reminds me, how do I find your character stuff? Where the fuck does it show up? Charis, where's Charis?

[Speaker 3]
On the side of the character sheet. On little tabs.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any spells you would like to try to cast on him?

[Speaker 3]
I could try fear. To run away. Hypnotic pattern.

That's only a minute.

[Speaker 4]
Hypnotic pattern's a charm spell.

[Speaker 3]
Fear's only a minute. They don't only last a minute.

[Speaker 1]
Fear would force them to run away. Or to dash away.

[Speaker 4]
Didn't you mention that a possible way to get rid of a charm effect would be doing your own charm effect?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Hypnotic pattern's a charm effect.

[Speaker 1]
Alright then. Temporarily. I'd like to actually charm the person.

[Speaker 3]
Boom. Alright. I am fucking done.

[Speaker 1]
You know what?

[Speaker 3]
Just stay inside.

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna turn towards Silk at the moment. The other Ettin and I assume Vati have been running back to the one that was currently digging. Silk?

There's nothing that you can see in your immediate vicinity here.

[Speaker 2]
Is there still the Ettin freaking out?

[Speaker 1]
The Ettin is still freaking out. He is currently digging at his shields.

[Speaker 2]
Could I cast minor illusion to make his legs look like they're normal? I'm wondering if I can put an illusion over the illusion on his legs to try to snap him out of it.

[Speaker 1]
Minor illusion would when he...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, as soon as he touches it.

[Speaker 4]
I'll give him advantage on his saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll spend my action doing that.

[Speaker 4]
By now I probably would have arrived to the screen, right?

[Speaker 2]
You said two minutes, right?

[Speaker 4]
Close.

[Speaker 1]
They're like, Oh. It's not here anymore. Where'd it go?

Did you kill it?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Shot it right off your leg.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Huh. It's ready to go back to digging.

You're hardly... Atleth is like, Boss, boss, what do we do?

[Speaker 2]
You got me. Let's regroup with the team.

[Speaker 1]
Do you see anything? I can't see. I thought I saw something looking at us earlier, but...

[Speaker 2]
Uh... I'm gonna try to just best guess and start sloshing wherever I might think they could be.

[Speaker 1]
What, in the water?

[Speaker 2]
If I can hear them. You have not seen anything out of the water.

[Speaker 1]
You have not seen anything inside the water, not even the slightest disturbance. With the exception of the Ettin bounding over and now Lucin bounding over and Vati as well.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Um... Uh...

I guess I kind of want to patrol the water because it... I don't know if I've actually stepped or visited a big portion of this. So I think I'll maybe try to have us patrol over this way.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. At this point, I'm gonna have everybody... We're gonna take a very short break and we're gonna have a quick combat.

[Speaker 8]
Hooray.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, I was muted. Oh, hell nah.

[Speaker 1]
Are you... Why would you mute yourself now of all times?

[Speaker 6]
I didn't know I was muted. That's the thing. Why would you do that?

[Speaker 1]
You have to click the button to do it.

[Speaker 6]
No, because my microphone has a built-in mute.

[Speaker 1]
It has a call button. Okay. Alright, well what were some of the things that you were saying?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I was basically... I was basically just laughing at my rolls. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright. Well, the people who are going to be participating here are going to be...

To start off with, they're going to be Edmund, Kibi, and Karis. And then Silkalith and Lucent should consider a way that they can quickly make it over before we see a five-minute recording. Ten.

[Speaker 8]
Five. Five.

[Speaker 1]
Keep away. At the moment, your party members are about 1,500 feet away from the... You guys who are by the Etna are about 1,500 feet away from the pyramid.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Are they... Are they within...

How far can Silk actually see and make out figures?

[Speaker 1]
You're across open plains, so...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can see all of them.

[Speaker 2]
So basically the status is like, doesn't seem like much is going on in the pool, but some crazy stuff's going down by the pyramid.

[Speaker 1]
There was never anything going on in the pool. There was the Etna who thought something was going on.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Cool. So forget the patrolling thing.

Get back with the team. Figure out what's going on at the pyramid over here.

[Speaker 1]
Look, I tried my fucking best.

[Speaker 3]
Let my fucking ass. I tried. Yeah, several attempts were made to stop him.

[Speaker 2]
It's alright. Silk's got invisibility. Haleth can run.

[Speaker 6]
I like how your best effort was completely negated by the fact that I just have so many hit points.

[Speaker 2]
Did you try to cast sleep on a level 8 PC?

[Speaker 3]
Look, like I said, out of fucking options.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, wow.

[Speaker 6]
Not a level 8 PC, a level 8 barbarian with tough.

[Speaker 1]
How is Kara still only level 8? I feel like she'd be higher level by this point.

[Speaker 3]
Almost. Almost. Almost level 9.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have like a rope or something you could lasso in person? Or like Hoth? That would not work.

Run around them to tie them up? You know who else thought it wouldn't work was the Imperial AT-AT walkers. You know how that turned out for them.

[Speaker 3]
I could shoot them in the knee. That would stop them.

[Speaker 2]
First you'd have to hit.

[Speaker 1]
Second... Someone's going to be a hold person or you're not that difficult to hit. That's going to be a hold person.

There's some gunfire or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
If it's a charm, damage might break it, right?

[Speaker 1]
So just slap them. Somebody's going to look around for the caster. If it's a thing that happens, if there's a cast, somebody charms you, there's a caster.

[Speaker 2]
Are these are the hexes?

[Speaker 1]
No, no. I'm pulling up it. Like I said, let's don't ask me any questions at the moment because I've got this map on here.

[Speaker 2]
No worries.

[Speaker 7]
Am I in here at a bad time?

[Speaker 2]
You're playing this session.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to put you on mute for a second.

[Speaker 6]
PB, I am so surprised you managed to actually grapple me.

[Speaker 3]
PB is strong.

[Speaker 6]
You're level 9. Like you got PB of 4.

[Speaker 3]
After this fight we might have to call it a night.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine.

[Speaker 3]
My brain power is going away. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and drag your characters when they're ready. Go ahead and drag them to the top right over here.

[Speaker 3]
Loading.

[Speaker 6]
Top right.

[Speaker 1]
Not that far. Not that far to the top right.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Like the actual... Not the...

[Speaker 2]
What? Fluffy Panda in their About Me section says that they are recording for administrative purposes.

[Speaker 1]
Pandy, don't worry about that for now. I can do stuff later. Right now they're not actually...

[Speaker 3]
Can you highlight where again? Or can someone...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, cool. Res, you are 60 feet away from... Go ahead and place yourself.

60 feet away from the door. It's on the top right side. And then Eris and PB will be 60 feet away.

[Speaker 3]
Why is it putting me under? The hell? Oh, there we go.

No? God, that's so weird. I can't...

I can't see. I mean, I can, but... Yeah, something is wrong with my vision.

[Speaker 1]
What? What's the...

[Speaker 3]
Everything is blue.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I can't actually...

[Speaker 4]
Grayscale.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, but what's the issue with Kibi?

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's fine. Kibi can see all the other tokens, but when I... God.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I'm back. Are we putting our tokens on?

[Speaker 3]
Yep, top corner. Yeah, I don't know what that was. But it's fixed now.

[Speaker 1]
I turned on global illumination. Remember, Kibi and Karis are gonna be right next to... Gonna be right next to admin.

That's where they finished off. I will move them. Okay.

And you three can... I guess everybody can add themselves to the initiative at this point. It's just everybody else is really far away.

Yeah, the thing that... What's the initiative? I think you guys are gonna be surprised here.

Door opens? This is gonna be awful for Shrouded. The door to the pyramid opens and...

Well, Kibi, you have never laid eyes on this mummy lord. He very much recognizes the sword that's on your back right now. And does recognize you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy. Tis not good.

[Speaker 5]
Vaati can't be surprised with pre-cognition, but I'm still just fairly far away, so...

[Speaker 3]
I'm not sure that my barbarian can be... Let me just double check. I don't think I can be surprised.

Yeah, I don't think... No, I can't be surprised. Yeah, I can't be surprised.

So long as I rage. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And you are not surprised. There's a... The mummy opens the door.

He's decked out, and he's drinking Earl Grey tea, which he drops upon seeing you. So I guess that was his turn. So...

Kibi actually gets to start off with this here.

[Speaker 3]
Start us off here. Rage? Rage.

Rage. And what's your rage?

[Speaker 1]
What are you going to be doing here?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm trying to rage. It's just weird.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's because you already have rage applied to the token.

[Speaker 3]
Strange. Okay. Um...

Where's the mummy? Ah, he's over there.

[Speaker 1]
Just got to do your thing.

[Speaker 3]
And I will run forward with my sword. I'm double raged.

[Speaker 6]
So Kibi, do you stop grappling me then? Because you just moved 45 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Meaning you now have free reign to your own demise. Lovely. She sees Kibi sees a mummy and wants to unravel it.

So... Uh... And that is her turn.

Because I am actually kind of nervous about this thing.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. And this will come to... Alright, so do you have any means of getting here quickly?

And also what's your top rage?

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, I had myself on mute. My range on my ice bite is pretty far. Why can't I bring up my...

It is 150 feet close range, 600 feet long range.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so after... Let's see here. You guys are 1500 feet away.

[Speaker 2]
I can cast Misty Step.

[Speaker 1]
That would aid you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll burn that.

[Speaker 1]
And then I'll give you another free perception check to check your surroundings. Because technically you guys are being threatened.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Um...

[Speaker 1]
And a perception check.

[Speaker 2]
27.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you briefly look through the scope and you see there are three invisible figures wearing... Yeah, you see three invisible elves who are wearing a ghillie suit. Well, I shouldn't say it.

I don't know if they're ghillie suits if they blend in. But basically ghillie suits designed to blend in with the prairie grasses.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And they all have spellcasting influence.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Can I create a minor illusion right above them of just like a big red arrow pointing down at them?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. I'll call out enemy spotted.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Vati!

[Speaker 5]
I'm really just... I'm like 1500 away as well, but from a different angle. Slightly?

[Speaker 1]
No, you would have arrived with the other end to the location. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I'm still with... I can activate my stuff of telepathy, sorry, telekinesis to get a fly speed of 60 feet so I could dash and move 120 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Did you hear... Out of curiosity, did you hear Silk with the... Did you hear Silk with the...

[Speaker 5]
Minor illusions only 30 feet, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and they are quite close.

[Speaker 5]
They are that close?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. There's the mummy over by what's happening with Keras and stuff like that. Really, I shouldn't even have you guys on the same battle map, but I don't know how to do this at the same time.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then there's a bunch of spellcasters immediately south of you guys.

[Speaker 5]
So Silk has pointed them out, but I can't see them, right?

[Speaker 1]
That is correct.

[Speaker 5]
I'll use my stuff to do...

[Speaker 1]
They're standing right next to each other. Toward the south.

[Speaker 5]
I can hit them both with a telekinetic burst then if they're within 90 feet. I don't know what's just happened. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
I'll just move you guys out.

[Speaker 5]
So they'll both need to make a deck save. What the fuck? Dice are beaten.

And they both get pushed if they fail. They take half damage if they succeed. Yeah.

I'll center it just here in front of them so it pushes them away from us if they fail. 10 feet. And I'll just move across so we're not grouped and end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 5]
For the two that failed saves I can use my ability not in the face. If they're immune to charmed it doesn't work, but they can't target me if they can be charmed. Because they fail to save against my power.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. One of them is no longer invisible. Set these guys to this one.

Motherfucker. Sorry. I had to move this.

[Speaker 5]
Not planned, Kurt.

[Speaker 1]
Merely entangled. Go ahead and loosen silk and howleth. Go ahead and make these saves.

The other two here are just going to attempt to hide. That's that. So this guy is just going to get straight to casting spells, I guess.

Like, I require the sword back. Preferably in its original size. Yeah.

This is fun. Okay, here we go. Go attack versus Kiwi.

[Speaker 7]
The 23-day.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, uh, yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Oof.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Sorry, cubes. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Two levels above second, so... Nope, no, it did do it correctly. Oof.

And of course, in action, he's just going to use... Go ahead and make me a deck save, Edmund.

[Speaker 6]
All right. What?

[Speaker 1]
You've not taken any damage. That's six on the slot. Why are you retarded?

Okay, Edmund, your turn.

[Speaker 6]
I'm still charmed by suggestion.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, now there's a target in the way of your door-smashing activity.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, I should probably deal with that.

[Speaker 1]
You should try to get past him.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
If he resists, you know, just like the mummy, like, seize.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I'm going to rage for extra movement. I've let me move, like, 55 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Why are you even here?

[Speaker 6]
I need to go through.

[Speaker 4]
Just like it says, door through one.

[Speaker 6]
The door! Sure. And for my action, I'm going to dash.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, why are you dashing through? Why are you dashing?

[Speaker 6]
Because I need to get through the door.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what were the instructions in your suggestion?

[Speaker 6]
Break the door? Oh!

[Speaker 3]
You're just going to sack the door?

[Speaker 6]
Wait, do I remember the suggestion properly? Did you remember it properly now?

[Speaker 2]
It's a magical compulsion.

[Speaker 6]
My instructions were to smash the door, right.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I've Garrus is going to yell out to the mummy because in addition to dashing or not dashing, but running here. Okay. Okay.

Hold on. There we go. I was dragging her.

Alright. How far can I go? 40.

And she's going to yell out, He's charmed! Our friend is charmed! We don't want to fight!

Help!

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I can fix that.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi! Kibi! Kibi's going to Uh Uh, I don't know what to do with Kibi.

[Speaker 1]
Uh You always put it down to a die roll if you feel really nervous about it.

[Speaker 3]
You put it down to a point. Um Kibi's going to run up. Fuck you, Kibi.

Um and uh, start trying to like uh unravel the mummy.

[Speaker 1]
What does unravel mean in this context?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, she's just going to grab at the mummy. I don't want to attack. Okay.

Because I think the mummy can help us, right? Can't the mummy help us? What am I doing?

Making what?

[Speaker 1]
What are you doing? Yes, if you want to try to like take his bandages off, it's going to be like a I guess a grapple check in this case.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, which is athletics. How did I do? Oh, 16.

[Speaker 6]
Advantage.

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Uh, Kibi athletics.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you get him. Start getting your hands on the bandages.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just going to start following him.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. I'm just going to use a legendary action at this point to I would like to talk to this mummy.

[Speaker 3]
I don't want to kill him.

[Speaker 1]
And why?

[Speaker 3]
Because Kibi is a one track person, okay? She's already raged. What else can I do that isn't harming the thing to death?

[Speaker 2]
You want to rage negotiate?

[Speaker 8]
Exactly, nothing you can do.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's actually 60 feet over here. It makes the character like, help me control him. Alright, then Lucent, it is your turn.

Alrighty then. There he is. One of these elves is now visible.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Am I supposed to not be able to see anybody?

[Speaker 1]
You should be able to see somebody down to the south here. Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 4]
Weird. Okay, yeah, for some reason it was just doing a bit of a dumb.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
No worries. Yeah, I am just going to go for a good old... Yeah, I can probably tell that yeah, just Bruce wouldn't kill.

Uh, such pain. Uh, so they take 6 damage. Damn it.

It's not looking great.

[Speaker 6]
5d6. Just get the worst rolls possible. What do you have for 3rd level spells?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, 3rd level, Dar, Sending, I have Haste, but we're kind of stuck in technical right now. I have Counterspell. I really should have used that earlier, but too late for that, and I have Fireball.

But something tells me that maybe I should avoid using that uh, you know, in a... in this very small space, relatively speaking. You're in the wide open planes.

[Speaker 2]
And we think that there's two more here, although they could have moved. I guess you wouldn't know. You don't see them.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't see them.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, uh, bonus action, um, uh, Misty Step to teleport out of the entangle.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just go over here and burn Misty Step. Let me make sure I'm actually casting it to burn the slot. It's the last of my second level spell slots.

Um, uh, and then I'm going to ask, uh, Haleth, uh, to help me attack, uh, this guy. So I can hopefully attack with advantage. He's entangled, though, so.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Yeah, so you're attacking the... Do you want to attack that one, or do you want to attack the, um, invisibility ones?

I just clicked on your character and I realized that for... you can't actually see...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I target the invisible ones, yeah. For sure. No, that's a good point.

[Speaker 1]
I clicked on your character and I realized that your token still can't actually see them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Haleth can't see them, so he probably couldn't help me shoot them.

[Speaker 1]
Um... He could shoot...

[Speaker 2]
He'd, like, distract them, maybe.

[Speaker 1]
Well, as a reaction to you hitting them, he would be able to shoot them.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, contribute damage, yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Okay, so I'll probably just roll a regular attack, then?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Uh, so here's a regular attack. Ooh, it's only an 11 to hit.

[Speaker 1]
And 11 AC. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh, hey. Uh, so I'll do damage, and then he'll do damage with the uh, with the musket.

18. So, uh, 38 damage total.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 6]
All right, that one's dead.

[Speaker 2]
All right, and that's one of each ammo gone.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And... That's two party.

[Speaker 5]
How light is it down here? Do we...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's full light. It's just... All right, the guy that's further down south um, is invisible right now.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. That's just this guy that's visible that's still...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's that guy that's visible. So, the other two were still traveling together, and one of them just dropped dead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, um... On the one that's visible, I've got a range of dagger of mine. Uh...

I didn't include it. I'll move to within 30 feet of him. I know it's definitely 30.

Okay. Uh, he can only take the dash, disengage, or dodge action next turn.

[Speaker 1]
He can take the dead action.

[Speaker 5]
Brain explodes. I need to do a manifestation test. One...

That's bad. Disadvantage on strength checks. Speed halved.

Very good. As a bonus action, I'll use my first order power sharpened senses to make a perception check with advantage to try and spot the last one. I'll listen for the last one, I guess would be...

[Speaker 1]
I hear the rustling in the bushes over here. And... I guess I can just put like a small little like a flying object.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, just call out, it's next to the corpse. And end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then the last druid is up next. His invisibility is going to fade as he's going to cast dimension door. Just to...

Do... Let's see here, I guess the only person with good 6D is... Do you have anything analogous to counterspell?

[Speaker 2]
Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, so he pops out there.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I do.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, we have a counterspell, don't we? At a range. Body doesn't have anything like that.

[Speaker 6]
Shame.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Mosgang is going to cast dispel magic on Edmund, which is going to clear the suggestion spell. Oh, thank god.

[Speaker 6]
Lovely.

[Speaker 1]
Yay, we didn't die.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, what?

[Speaker 4]
Poor panda.

[Speaker 3]
Charis will thank them profusely for... de-suggesting... Edmund.

[Speaker 1]
There will be no more interruptions. My team this morning will be letting you all get back to whatever it is that passes for work around here.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like we should take this opportunity to ask a question, but my brain cells are done.

[Speaker 4]
I totally understand. We should probably ask about why some druids showed up. And started attacking.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like, what's going on? Why did the...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that was the... That was the centaurs called for help. And it seems reasonable that a druid circle, a ranger conflave, would answer.

So I imagine they were here to sabotage operations in the excavation. I only hope that the, you know, supposed miners and prospectors actually succeed in finding something of value before the entire thing is swept away.

[Speaker 3]
And what is your motivation for being here?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, well, since I was banished from the Hollow of Leo Claim and you stole that sword, as well as the Tomb Guard's halberd, my lovely pyramid here was forced to retreat, and it was a backup plan. So now my hope is that I can find something in the Ys region that's going to allow me to, you know, to change myself, get a little bit of, uh, feel alive again. There was a chrysalis I could have used in the Hollow of Leo Claim to do this, but then I was just thwarted, so this is where my pyramid teleported to shortly thereafter, and I offered my services to...

Offered my services to... Ah, the...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you know, I... Heal...

[Speaker 1]
I heal those in need of healing, and then provide some magical wards around the place. You know, a little bit of extra, make the construction go by a little bit easier occasionally, but money. I give them some additional money.

[Speaker 3]
Ah. Do you give us some money? No.

The pyramid seems lovely.

[Speaker 1]
You're holding my sword. You're holding my guardian sword, which is still lying in ruins in the entryway of my lovely pyramid. My once-lovely pyramid.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it's still lovely.

[Speaker 1]
I'm giving you the opportunity to walk away.

[Speaker 3]
Hm. Well, thank you.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'm sorry. You're telling me. Real quick, are you the one who...

[Speaker 1]
Are you going to speak at more than 15 words per minute? Perhaps I could boil up some new tea while I wait for you to finish your sentence.

[Speaker 3]
It would be lovely. I'd love some tea.

[Speaker 6]
Did you put those words in my head?

[Speaker 3]
What words in your head?

[Speaker 6]
Smash door.

[Speaker 1]
Smash door. No, I have a slightly more expansive vocabulary. I'm sure whoever put those words in your head did too, but I simply would've...

[Speaker 4]
We'll just leave it at that. I do believe that would be the fault of the druids over there. They seemed to have run away.

[Speaker 3]
They wanted in. Why?

[Speaker 4]
Well, I do imagine they probably want to sabotage this place, so...

[Speaker 1]
Everyone's a little high-strung here. I imagine Pythas isn't happy with my presence. The centaurs aren't happy with my presence.

[Speaker 4]
The miners, you know, they're not exactly...

[Speaker 1]
They're okay with my presence for the moment, but the miners are quite upset with their hearing complaints day and night and day and night about treatment of this and healing of that and working conditions of this.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Why isn't Pythas happy with you being here?

[Speaker 1]
I'm an interloper. I'm not really supposed to be here. I'm here to use the gate for my own purposes, and quite frankly, I don't think he wishes to bother with me.

I certainly don't blame him. I don't wish to bother with him either. That's why I have some precautions to make sure we've either bypassed one another or I could just smash him outright.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's certainly a thing you can do.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I do must say, your pyramid looks lovely. It reminds me quite well of some of those most well-preserved ruins.

[Speaker 1]
Why is he speaking in lowercase?

[Speaker 4]
Well, your pyramid seems quite lovely. And I do believe you mentioned...

[Speaker 1]
Louder, please, when addressing the state of my magnificence. I worked quite hard on this. You should be shouting it from the rooftops.

There are no rooftops nearby, but... It's beautiful.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I do understand one's pride and one's work. I do believe you mentioned the treatings of the items. I can't do much, but if there would be anything I can do to assist...

I have been able to treat the items.

[Speaker 1]
Why is one injured? Injured? I just prefer helping people.

Yes, but is one of the items injured? Not from my knowledge, but unfortunately I do not know the state of every single item here. Or when somebody is injured.

Yes. Okay. It was...

distinctly unpleasant to see while here. I understand.

[Speaker 3]
I wish we could have met under more pleasant circumstances.

[Speaker 1]
I wish we had never met at all.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, don't be that!

[Speaker 4]
Well, I won't darken your door for now. I just start moving away.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
He's gonna start heading back to... He's gonna start heading back to where it's the... Yeah, the place where the miners were going at it.

The miners? Yes. The...

[Speaker 1]
Huh? I just wonder why the music's so late. No, you're fine.

What do you mean by the miners?

[Speaker 4]
Like the people, the Ettins digging over there. Oh, the Ettins. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We're all exhausted right now. That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
My brain is just like... My brain is never at full capacity.

[Speaker 6]
I'm in combat brain. I want to fight something.

[Speaker 1]
What you should have done was when your teammates asked you what was going on, you should have been like, Hey, this is exactly what's going on.

[Speaker 8]
Help. That was one of your options. You didn't actually have to do that.

[Speaker 1]
It was... It's fine. All right.

Well, so next time we pick this up, you guys, can I pick you up down time, or we could like pick this up where we left off? It's adjacent to the road. Literally right next to it.

So I don't care much one way or the other. But down time probably would be a good idea for those of you who... If you want to get a head start next session.

[Speaker 3]
Sure. Phoebe's going to keep a close eye on her sword.

[Speaker 1]
Phoenix, you're muted.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. That sounds good.

[Speaker 7]
Is the session over now?

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to be going to bed soon-ish. But, yeah. I got to calculate some eggs.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 1]
You guys actually did do a pretty significant number on that.

[Speaker 3]
It was great. Really?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Um... Do you mind if I ask? Do you mind if I ask?

Oh, okay. Are you talking to me?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah. You go first.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Do you mind if I ask a couple questions here?

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 7]
I was trying to see if anyone had time tonight to help me with my character or what would go on with that.

[Speaker 1]
I do... I would not be able to do it tonight. Like I said, I'm running...

I finished running a session now, but now I'm exhausted. And I'm probably going to be... I'm probably prepping for the next session.

[Speaker 7]
But... Do you have a session tomorrow or what time would you be available?

[Speaker 1]
I would not be available tomorrow. I would not be available on... Sunday either.

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Is there someone else who I could do it with?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. If somebody gets the character sheet together. I saw you were working with Rez the other day.

And basically just... Asking chat. No, you're fine.

Basically just asking chat like, Hey, I need some help getting my character sheet set up. It's... What is it?

We're up to the new... We're using the new 5e system. So that's...

My brain is so fucking exhausted right now.

[Speaker 2]
Do you need help getting it set up in Foundry? Is that what you're asking for help with? Or just like get a character created like, just getting like a 5th edition like character building stuff.

[Speaker 7]
I have the character mainly built. I just need him to approve my magic item that I wanted to do.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 7]
And I wanted him to make sure I have a character sheet in there that I can finish implementing everything in. Right, right. Let me give you an account on Foundry.

Yeah, let me create the... If I need any further help I can just ask. Yeah, so let me add you to Foundry.

[Speaker 2]
The magic item stuff you could probably just tag him in your like the character forum post that you have. I imagine that's where you made your character like everyone else. You just tag James there.

He's pretty good about responding when he has time.

[Speaker 7]
Can I explain what the magic item is I want to do? Briefly, yeah. I want to get to the rest of the...

[Speaker 1]
I want to finish closing out the session.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, you guys can finish then.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Here, just tag me in it later and then I'll be able to get to it.

[Speaker 2]
If you type it out or do you need help typing it out?

[Speaker 7]
I've already typed it out. It's in my thing.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 7]
Just re-tag me in there. Then I'll jump back. I'll go ahead and do that then.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that was a slower burn session, but I still enjoyed it. Mostly because whenever the slower burn sessions happen, usually there's like something really exciting afterwards. Usually it just kind of like gets all the mucking groundwork out of the way and then something insane happens in the next session.

[Speaker 4]
So I usually get optimistic about it. Yeah, me and Moe, I'm just kind of like looking at one of the future events of a session at 4am. Oh boy.

4am? The Hydra Resurrection, apparently.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, what is it at 4am?

[Speaker 4]
For me it would be.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if I can figure out one of the I wonder if I can get one of the hero people to run that one actually.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. It says Sunday at 1am. Let's prevent a Hydra Resurrection.

I wonder if there's an error in the time.

[Speaker 1]
I think so. I assumed it said that's 9.30 for me. Nice, I assume that's 2.30, right?

And maybe Paul was saying he thought the event he posted was 2.30. Yeah, I was just like wondering.

[Speaker 4]
It seemed a bit off.

[Speaker 2]
That'd be pretty brutal.

[Speaker 4]
I admit.

[Speaker 2]
But on European time, that's not crazy.

[Speaker 1]
Don't get me wrong, I've done 2am sessions, not for Europeans specifically, but for the Anzacs. I first started the Sky Pirates campaign that Discord was for way back when.

[Speaker 4]
I wouldn't be opposed to waking up in time for that, but... For that one in particular, I would...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I couldn't get away with that. I don't want to wake my gorilla up at 4am to do that, and then I'm only going to have four hours to play because I've got work at 8.30. Alright, so tomorrow there's a Hydra...

[Speaker 6]
or something?

[Speaker 1]
Sunday. But that time needs to be edited. In fact, what I'm going to do is I'm going to edit that time.

[Speaker 4]
So that way it's actually...

[Speaker 6]
And when will we be picking up this?

[Speaker 1]
That's up to you guys. I recommend doing it sometime later this week. My best days are Tuesday and Thursday.

And then Wednesday... No, Tuesday I'm not going to be able to do... Tuesday I'm not going to be able to do anything.

And Wednesday I'm not going to be able to do anything. But Thursday... Tuesday is my work day.

And then Thursday I'm also going on a day trip. So that's possible. Thursday...

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to be unavailable until next Friday after this next session.

[Speaker 2]
Did you hire a lawyer? Are you representing yourself in court?

[Speaker 1]
I'm representing myself. It's a toe hearing.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds like you've got enough evidence and stuff that it should go fine without representation. We'll see what happens. It depends on the judge.

[Speaker 2]
There's lots of judges that hate dealing with that kind of stuff.

[Speaker 5]
But...

[Speaker 1]
A toe hearing is small claims.

[Speaker 2]
I'm probably used to that then.

[Speaker 1]
It's the justice of the peace, right? I'm not suing them in a trial court.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be old hat. And then if this court case goes well... then at some point in the next two years I will then sue them.

[Speaker 2]
In small claims court for a...

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It needs to specifically be a trial court, which I don't understand the distinction there, but I will have time to figure it out.

[Speaker 2]
A lot of it has to do with filing stuff. In a trial court, if you want to bring a lawsuit, there's different requirements for timeliness, what you need to submit, who you need to submit it to, and that kind of stuff. The venue is important.

A lot of the stuff that lawyers do is not arguing in court. It's just doing all the filings and getting them all in on time.

[Speaker 1]
File the motions. I just filed and updated an amended petition.

[Speaker 2]
That's what they hire paralegals and all that kind of stuff for, because that's a huge amount of work to take on. I do not envy trying to get something done through the legal system.

[Speaker 1]
For this one in particular, people have had an easier time as far as self-representation goes. One of the cases I'm going to be citing most often, and I'm going to need to cite definitely in the future, is black bull towing versus I forget who the actual plaintiff was. I'm basically establishing there's two different ways that you can sue people for what the tow company did.

One of them is in the tow hearing that just says, did you fuck up on the amount of money that you were supposed to charge these people? Did you have calls to tow them to begin with? Are you still holding their card?

That's the one that you can hold for 2308.453 in the Texas Occupations Code. Then there's 2308.404 through 405, which has to do with the small claims and misdemeanor charges that you would levy against somebody for the reckless, intentional, or no, which I can't handle in the Justice of Peace Court.

[Speaker 2]
That's where you can get compensatory and punitive damages.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's just... What is it? What's the phrase used for?

Strict liability?

[Speaker 2]
It depends on whether it has to be knowing. Because if it's possible, if there's not a knowledge requirement, or if there is a knowledge requirement, then all they have to have done is their due diligence. While I didn't know, I did all my due diligence for what I was supposed to check out.

[Speaker 1]
The fact that it got through isn't my fault. I have photo evidence that they did which felt pretty good. They take pictures of everything beforehand, and then they sign on the tow sheet what they took inventory of, what they did, whether they put a dollar bill in the car.

[Speaker 2]
A misrepresentation on the document relative to what you have photographic evidence of. That's pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
That's about as good as it gets. The three requirements for the misdemeanor and for the $1,000 plus fees assessed. I didn't pay any fees either time.

They tried to squeeze fees out of me, but the second time I decided I'm definitely suing these fucking people. That's fees assessed, not fees paid. I got some time to figure out if there's any meaningful distinction there.

I'm definitely going to get the $1,000 for the two counts if I win. There's fees assessed in which they tried to squeeze $272 out of me each time. According to them, the second time they were trying to get $350 out of me.

Fuck it, I'm just going to go for the full. I'm just going to go for that amount, plus missed work, plus whatever else I could get under strict liability, and go from there. Ideally, I would be able to steer them into settling.

Like, hey, I'm not going to try to get you guys $1,000.

[Speaker 2]
If you prevail at this, and then that helps you with the finding in the second thing, that's obviously a lot of leverage.

[Speaker 1]
Because I want them dead, but I will settle for money.

[Speaker 6]
You'll settle for it.

[Speaker 1]
This is how you manipulate people, Rez. You've got to start off with the big ask, and then you can let them talk you down. Alright, I'll update you at that time.

I'm going to be gone for...

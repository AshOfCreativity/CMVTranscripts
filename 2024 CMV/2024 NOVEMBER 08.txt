[Speaker 2]
What should we do for, or what are your recommendations as far as like starting level and going into Pathfinder 2nd edition? Because Mythic Rules did just come out.

[Speaker 1]
I haven't looked at the Mythic Rules, but I don't really think they're that good.

[Speaker 3]
I've smacked a free PDF, I haven't read it either. I will get to it.

[Speaker 1]
A lot of the stuff that comes out in specific books is very... well, specific. I feel like they need to...

there's a class as well that came out in its own book, the Kineticist, where it doesn't really interact with the rest of the stuff. I feel like there's a lot of things where the Mythic Rules don't interact, but this is all just... I've seen people say this on Reddit sort of thing, which is where I get a lot of my opinions from because I'm a Redditor.

I don't really know enough about the Mythic Rules to say whether they're good or...

[Speaker 2]
We're looking at it as a potential for including some of the magic items that you guys have found, or the powers that you've acquired over time. Basically being like, alright, since you did level up in this way, this way, this way, here's how you guys can recover a few of those.

[Speaker 4]
So we're keeping our character's progress when we switch over?

[Speaker 2]
I wanted to represent your character's progress.

[Speaker 4]
So they have all their memories.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you're going to have pretty much all of your memories. Which I think should be the nice part, because you'll have meta knowledge of the module, and then you can just go from there.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like, dude, last time we did this did not turn out well. Yeah, we got a stump on the ice like now.

[Speaker 2]
Do you know where the Sun Shrines are on the map, and the different world roots locations and shit like that?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that'll be nice.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we can actually start, I guess, making allies and saving people.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think Chariz is going to leave the Feywild. She's just going to chill. You know what?

I have a gun now. Come find me, bitch.

[Speaker 3]
Honestly good for her.

[Speaker 2]
What do you think is Spawn's starting level for a new theater? Oh, sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, no, no. I was just remembering all the Fey nonsense that we got roped into. And I still remember getting captured by that Ballad and just basically being AWOL for three weeks.

[Speaker 2]
That happened twice.

[Speaker 4]
Twice? You wouldn't have two nickels. One of my favorite requests that we did was when we got kidnapped and taken to that party.

The party. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
What was the other time?

[Speaker 2]
The other time was Rosamarinia. Her Ballad was about seduction or seducing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's the one I was talking about. What?

[Speaker 2]
I think we're talking about two different parties.

[Speaker 3]
I was not there. Was I there?

[Speaker 4]
Hold on.

[Speaker 3]
I was there for Rosamarinia, but not for getting kidnapped to a party with Zephain. I do remember hearing a bit about it, and that's how Nessie became pen pals with Zephain, no?

[Speaker 2]
That is how they did it. There was a mushroom convoy, and a bunch of mushrooms got up and walked out. The convoy went into the Feywild, and the convoy was doing this on purpose.

They could sell some of the Feywild mushrooms for extra cash. Possibly with a cheap escape. But one of the guards was secretly a Fey, an aspiring Feylord or a minded Feylord who was trying to get a bunch of stuff, and was throwing a party for all of the major Feylords in Zemain.

[Speaker 3]
So. That's exciting. So we could maybe start ironing out what we want to do in the future, lest we get roped into things we don't want to.

Or, if we want to get roped into them, prepare for them. Should it happen again. Fair enough.

It might not, considering it's a soft reset, so not everything will happen in the same order.

[Speaker 4]
So maybe I shouldn't become big. Wait, if I become big, if I become big, can I un-become big? No, I think it's just a one-time thing, isn't it?

[Speaker 3]
You have to figure out how to un-become big.

[Speaker 2]
You could un-become big, but you would have to figure out how to... You could become big, you would have to figure... There was a way to un-become big, but you would have to figure that way out, the idea.

[Speaker 4]
Is that a quest, or is that like a research thing?

[Speaker 2]
More of a downtime thing, I think. A little bit of questing, a little bit. You're following the path of who's.

My best friend, Luke.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. That sounds fun.

[Speaker 2]
Alden of the Sangha.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure I have notes on that somewhere, too.

[Speaker 2]
That'll be fun. Lady, so what should I do for... What would you recommend for starting level for a new DM doing stuff here?

[Speaker 1]
It would be level 1. I think it just has to be level 1. Not that it takes too long to level up, really.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I'm feeling.

[Speaker 1]
I think you'd want to have a tutorial dungeon. And you'd just need to run that for everyone with level 1 characters. Or at least a few times.

[Speaker 2]
I still have all the maps for that Nixie dungeon thing. Where is it? The hidden block.

I still have maps for some of the hollows that are around. We could play them without Shoal's Mine, the Cape of Opal Gold. We could play those without plant growth this time.

That'll be a lot of fun. There's all the other level 1 quests that weren't complete or ready around the time that they were... They were still technically in development around the time that we wanted to...

I shouldn't say level 1, like start of the module things. They could absolutely be made for level 1.

[Speaker 1]
You've got plenty of stuff. You want to be giving out like 300 XP an hour, I feel. Maybe it's a bit too much.

[Speaker 2]
The thing about Pathfinder 2 is it looks like there's plenty of rewards to hand out. And there's plenty of monsters that work.

[Speaker 1]
There's a great selection of monsters that all have unique abilities. Which is really fun.

[Speaker 2]
Are those included just standard in... Oh, that's the other thing I could do. I could buy some Pathfinder 2-y Adventure Paths and steal the maps for them.

[Speaker 1]
Not even the Adventure Paths. There's plenty of single-shot adventures as well. Like that one that Otter had us do where we're playing as the Kobolds.

Yes. There's plenty of stuff like that if you look on the website. For the game system, you get all of the rules for free.

And all of the monster sources for free with Foundry. But you can pay to get the nice token art. Which is something I recommend.

There's lots of adventure content as well.

[Speaker 2]
So four new characters. I'm going to try to make a new character here, I guess. On Pathbuilder 2-y.

[Speaker 1]
Pathbuilder is pretty good. You do have to pay to get some of the features like free archetype, I think. Free archetype doesn't come in until level 2 anyway.

[Speaker 2]
That was going to be my next question.

[Speaker 1]
What is free archetype? It's very similar to your secondary classes. As an archetype, you can take a multi-class or more specific things.

I'll give an example. You don't multi-class in Pathfinder. You take an archetype for your second class.

So if you're playing a fighter and you wanted to learn monk abilities, you'd take the monk dedication. You can take archetype feats instead of your class feat. But with the free archetype rules, you can take them every second level for free.

I feel like I explained that badly.

[Speaker 2]
I get it. It sounds like it works a lot like 4th edition multi-classing. Where multi-classing wasn't like splitting up your levels.

It was taking feats.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, it's exactly like that. For example, with fighter, you get a fighter class feat every second level, mostly. So you could take one of your fighter feats at those levels, or you could take an archetype and widen your abilities.

It depends on the sort of build you're going. So there's all the multi-class archetypes. There's one for each class.

Then there's more specific things like acrobat. Archaeologist. It would help expand on the things your character can do in the same way that your secondary class would.

The secondary class that you had are definitely a lot more integrated into the 5e classes.

[Speaker 2]
I would have liked to do them as feats. I didn't have an option to do them. Feats aren't really built into 5th edition.

They just happen every once in a while and throw everything off.

[Speaker 1]
I think once you spend enough time with the system, you could definitely make them as archetype feats.

[Speaker 4]
Is there a fairy race?

[Speaker 1]
There is!

[Speaker 4]
Okay, good.

[Speaker 1]
There's also leshies. Oh, I love those. Those are awesome.

[Speaker 3]
Remember how you said you wanted to be a werewolf? Apparently there's a thing that can make you werewolf-ish. You're part werewolf.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe a vampire?

[Speaker 1]
I think there's archetype feats to be undead. Werewolves and stuff, I think. There's also like...

There's a damp bear... ancestry. No, a heritage, sorry.

I think there's like skeleton races and stuff you can play as. I didn't know that. You can be an animal compared to the first level?

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
You can be an awakened animal, I remember that. You can be an awakened animal.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. At level 2, you could take... This is my wife, who's not awakened.

At level 2, you could take the... If we're doing a free archetype, you could take the werecreature dedication, which makes you a werecreature. You have a humanoid shape, an animal shape, and a hybrid.

And then you'd get... There's like a fate tree you can pick from every second level.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, word.

[Speaker 1]
For... You can play as a pixie. And they have...

subraces as well. Oh.

[Speaker 3]
You can play as a sprite.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Woohoo!

[Speaker 1]
They have a reach of 0 feet. You have to be in their square to attack them.

[Speaker 4]
So, I'm using my gun, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Small price to pay for being tiny.

[Speaker 1]
In my game, my partner's currently playing a sprite. And she is playing a cavalier, because there's a free... One of the race feats they get lets them have a familiar that is a corgi mount.

So she rides around on a corgi with a lance. I love that. Because the lance has reach, it gives her the standard 5 foot reach that you normally get.

Yeah, she can't fly, but...

[Speaker 4]
She is a sprite. Because corgis are supposed to be... Mythologically, they're supposed to be fairy mounts.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, that's what they've drawn from... It's amazing. Yeah, so there's different types of sprite you can play as.

There's the Draxie, which is like a... fairy-dragon type of pixie. There's the Grig, which is...

more like Jiminy Cricket. You have cricket... hindquarters and adore art and music.

You can play a luminous sprite, which is... you glow. Like the ones in Baldur's Gate 3 that are in the moonlight torches.

There's the Melixie, which is... you have the features of bee, butterfly, or other insect. You can talk to insects and...

that. And then there's... There's the classic pixie, which instead of tiny...

your size is small instead. Oh, there's also bat pixies as well.

[Speaker 3]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know how to describe it. I'm just going to send a default picture for it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah... Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Huh. Hmm. I see.

They're fellas, Lou.

[Speaker 1]
I need to get some stuff. I'll be back in a second.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no worries.

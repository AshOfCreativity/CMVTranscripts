[Speaker 1]
At all just I should just get rid of them and then apparently they were gotten rid of by discord itself and at that Well, I didn't do anything. It's just like, you know the fucking server I was a part of Yeah Well, supposedly the discord there was a discord that he was a part of that got shut down for bullying and harassment And I was like, I don't I don't want you around here. I know you I know that you could have just been like a fucking idiot About any number of things You have to be clever about bullying and harassment it has to be it has to be funny The person you're bullying has to enjoy it Like yeah, I'm gonna shove you in the crystal like oh, that's that's hilarious.

Nobody's actually going inside a crystal, right? It's like oh, it's all good fun now but like There's a bunch of other things that you could say They're very distasteful and a bunch of people I've been saying and I'm like, I you know what? I don't want that anywhere near here actually mmm, there is a Oh, I'm very no.

I'm gonna actually I'm just gonna ban this person. I Actually don't know who they are. I'm just no vibes alone.

Nobody can stop me. It's Yeah It's just like I don't wanna Well fucking deal with it anymore, yeah, it's a season of change, you know, I'm gonna be playing Pathfinder second edition I'm super punk for that That's so nice It's very cute actually, I'm just gonna listen to you guys while I'm Carrying some steak and waiting for Otter and Wendy to get here Oh Oh Hello insane jawa and PST time No, there's there's somebody in town hall who is asking if I can approve their character sheet. I don't Think I could do it. Don't know if I get like Here's the thing.

I Mean they follow that they follow the instructions really like one-to-one like they did it really well. Oh man, I'll let No, we're not to drink old piping amazing. I will let him jump in for the first encounter.

That'll be my compromise And that will give me plenty of time to boot him if he's annoying even before then hmm wait Wait on second thought We are already full mentally Next session though. I just I just don't know what that means and my You know like You get the idea right like our hackles are raised and I first all my dragons when the dragon plays Mm-hmm. It is fine.

So I guess I have an opportunity to type some things down for you folks and put them I guess on the I'll activate this Yeah, go ahead and hop in and while you're hopping in I'm gonna put some notes over in text Maybe I'll do it as a journal entry. We'll see maybe both. Yeah.

Oh, yeah Into foundry What did you do wrong? There's two frog at this right this frog and then frog at the Hope you guys are ready for dragons Yes Yep So or you're getting it down. So you guys are going to a place called the pool watching Or scoop meaning as it's referred to in the local draconic tongue It's a place that's a kind of trial area immediately before the brilliance of Ion restriction passage It often requires people to give up certain things of their past while they're traveling through it They encounter deeds of their own and those with them from Days past adventures past and often have to fight give up it's more like it's more like Replace is not the word right word replace You have to give things up by like placing them back in the world. Yeah.

No, I got it. Oh, no No plenty of times for that those jerks as well. More importantly you're using this to bypass files Of the of the realm before it allows you in You folks are going to be escorted in these trials by Sol Brasier And the first of your trials will be that of combat which is the right to have Sol Brasier escort you Yes, everybody should long rest their characters pretty good Harris every time I play with or will play with Karis.

I want to play changeling the dreaming changeling the There's a you know how there's like vampire the masquerade like there's a few World of darkness books about like vampires and werewolves and stuff. They have one for Faye It's unironically seems very good Sorry, would you say it seems really good? I stole a bunch of shit for them.

So I think like third year development I was like, ooh Pretty much. Yes He's a follower, right? Probably probably four.

I think four is the right one. Oh, no three seconds in dragon fire Vampire time It's with his gun. I also need to make sure that everybody has access to the white dragons Because they will be making a reappearance wait Rez and Fragartha, were you here for that?

I know that Nessie was For a while you guys had access to white dragons that were carrying you around the map Mostly because Corrigan had lost a shipment of white dragons Yeah, so for a while the party was using them to fly around. Oh, you might not have been actually Otter what otter definitely. There's nothing wrong with more pizza rolls That desire for pizza rolls All right Otter I assume tagged Tagged you right her or messaged you Nessie For when she was gonna be here.

That's fine. That's fine. I Could run up a practice combat in that time.

Let me see if Phineas is available. I know that he's sick today You don't know what a margarita Is to young Ooh fruity little umbrella If we meet up at a con or something, I'll give you a margarita But more likely you're gonna want something else like it Don't know like it was sunrise or something, but that can be that can be a range I'm just glad that the snot has mostly moved away from my face and down into my chest I mean, maybe if you get like the like the sugar around the room, I feel that You give me water I'm just a sink for like a A Mercury texture Actually, I guess I guess I get to ask people now if there's like stuff that they physically remember Metal metal textures, that's like what I'm looking for Do you folks remember fighting a mercury dragon if so, which of you I don't know Some of you were pretty close back then Oh So you could actually see it at the left side of the screen or you should be able to see it the left side Actually, possibly not.

Is there lighting and token vision enabled there is And that off eat. Oh Yeah, I put that little like that blue thing down So you guys would know where to set your tokens if you were setting your tokens anywhere No, no, this isn't it. This is just for where I'm placing information Yes Yeah, well you're gonna have to let go of your gun anyways, but here is a good place to do it How indeed you're gonna have to be very selective about what do you give up first?

I guess That would certainly make me nervous Well, you get to pick where black razor because anything that you don't pick I'm going to pick but if you do pick where black razor go then that'll be That would be smart If I was in control where black razor or if I had the opportunity to control where black razor went back into the world That's it might be what I'd do If somebody else is also going to know where You're gonna have to toss it back to a to a memory like if you toss it back to the tavern It's going to be there when the G of body family It owns it Well, you could that's the other thing is like also you do have the advantage of like All right, if there's an easy place that you want to leave some of your Some of your good stuff to give you I don't know like a heads up or whatever or a head start then You know in the belt of you a lot less fighting that's mostly going to be making decisions again about like how how you want to How you want to pursue the the new campaign As there's an older door is It's probably gonna be on the 22nd because I think that's when otter can do it That is the finale of fifth edition. I will never have to run this dogshit system ever again. I Cannot tell you how fucking angry I have been at just everything that is designed to cause me additional problems because Jeremy Crawford is it who is Hitler?

does not know how to Create anything of note or use for anybody About Jeremy Crawford being Hitler Yeah, that's right Nessie has a planet. Oh, no, you're right. You're right.

No, what happens to the planet? Thanks. Well those I guess one of the eligible locations then is going to be a planet a lot of the time so yeah, no the Like something I'll do is like I will I will provide locations for you guys I'll also give you the opportunity to select a different one You are you are permitted and encouraged to cheese it doesn't have to be an adventuring location But you get the idea Pathfinder 2 doesn't break the second you give people rewards. It does break if you give people better rewards They're too powerful. So you will have to like Well, it's probably gonna be nerfed in any instance, but remember it's also Pathfinder 2e So you get to upgrade it as time goes on as oh, yeah Yeah, no, they're not gone forever That's fine.

I Didn't really explain it to people It was more or less like I have to I can't I don't think I could make it to the end of the year Actually, you really just wanted like anything that wasn't going to be a really really really bad game I was just so tired of like having to constantly go back and and homebrew Creatures I was getting a little rough. There's a lot of choices that go into 20 minutes to like two hours worth of prep before every session trying to figure out exactly how you should be making sure that your monsters can actually hit players and That started to become a problem No, that wasn't a problem I I had no trouble like not The problem I own the only problem I ever had with your tanky characters was honestly just having Having them do something besides just stand there and miss Yeah, that was the that was the only problem like all right if the if My only problem is making sure that like people are doing things and it's a little easier to get away with Okay Like in Lancer for instance because there's sit-reps and there's usually objectives like recon Control hold out like hey get you have to control this zone. There's an objective and Then people can do that kind of like potato fight if they want to and and prolong that artificially But they will lose the objective Or maybe they don't right maybe they like maneuver themselves so they get the objective whatever that to be You know, I got the yet.

I got the VIP. I got the control zone That's gonna make sure that we have overwatch for these people who are I control the the high ground Yeah But that's It's something that they have to can that they have to worry about it There will be no sessions or just like people withing each other for like four hours whiffing What did you think I said, what did you think I said unbelievable That's what this is

[Speaker 2]
Give me the 4k You

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. I didn't leave the tab. I just exported the thing and yelling at me Fox fucker piece of shit One thing I'm really excited to do is bring back some of the hollows that some people have only seen my glimpses of or there's Like a couple that nobody have seen or only one person has seen like there's a name hollow which is just like the honey hollow and Only Landy has seen it The cloud.

Oh my god, we got to go back. That's gonna be so good in Pathfinder Going to be the most terrifying thing in all of reality. It's gonna be fucking horrific It's it's just gonna be that broke some people that broke quite a few people actually Never been to the cloud forest.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like you must Surely charismatic cloud force at some point there was a creature there.

[Speaker 1]
That was similar to the one from the cloud for No, okay. So scope one of scoters characters died in the cloud forest You guys were there very briefly as were teleported in there. So that's why it like That those those ten minutes of terror were a microcosm of what people felt every time they went into that place Yeah Nessie do you want to give your uh, do I have to do a reflection?

I mean race me No, I was wondering if you If you could remind frog of the what like the cloud force is and why people are fucked up about it Yeah the hide-behind Just a regular old cryptid only one person attempted to damage it once But the two ladies who came in and with anime characters and left about three sessions later One of them asked fireball on it and it completely Evaded the damage. I was the only time in the entirety of the campaign that somebody tried to damage it

[Speaker 2]
Which I was surprised by yeah, there were a lot of weird like critters like there was there's

[Speaker 1]
There were squirrels who like

[Speaker 2]
Who this book

[Speaker 1]
There's um, the the big quest that people did there there were two big quests one of which was like finding an old the hut of an old murderer and Himself having been murdered and that was like your first loop.

Well, not your first clue, but that was the one time that you guys have been I Think the second time that you guys were set on the trail of the of the knives and sheriffs and The the glass knife guy as he went over and he he found this old murderer and killed him and You guys found his trail. There was a bunch of there was a bunch of loot there to make use of And para was there for that session. I know that there was I Think that there was the other big session that you guys were in there for was Some guy there was an old ranger wanted to get his Wanted to get some like remains of his father Or or some remnants of his father and Just as you guys like hey trying to track down It's an old corpse like it's it's been 40 years if you could track this thing down.

It's gonna be great for me so They they went into the forest and they're sort of on a safari in the meantime, there's like squirrels with Clouds for like little smoke trails for tails There's deer with glowing antlers There's elks who have like every time they sort of scream or call out it parts the it parts the fog in front of them a lot just like a lot of And they go it they go in there I think also to like activate potentially a Sun Shrine but they go in there looking for this stuff and Oh, the other thing was it was it was tangentially related to the to the pits of convergence Which was a weird a weird thing that you guys were involved in later on. But anyways You Guys keep going further and further in and you eventually found the place that This this old ranger who his you find the place where his father had been he and his father had been attacked and they found his they found the bow they found his dagger and Lady put on his yeah, there was a dagger Landy put on his like one of his characters put on x-ray goggles and Looked through and saw through the tree in front of him a very very very like long Skeleton like Sasquatch Sasquatch Sasquatch like but like way too thin and way too tall Um we're gonna really like and contorted in ways that were functionally impossible for like a normal creature to be and It like swiftly left and while they were looking and looking for the remains they found the remnants of a spell That had been and they deduced through arcana checks and stuff like that that a spell the spell had been reversed by accident

[Speaker 2]
It was a spell that would encase a creature Under the earth until it was

[Speaker 1]
In case a creature under the earth until it was basically hit by a reverse of the spell But by reversing the spell he accidentally traps Instead of instead of this old ranger trapping the trapping the hide-behind he accidentally trapped himself

[Speaker 2]
But the players then dispelled this magic And and reversed it that's restoring the ranger and

[Speaker 1]
So they went back they reunited they reunited these two guys who look like they're the same age Because like ones ones 40 like they both could they look like brothers at this point because they're both like If the one guy was like frozen in his 40s and the other guys Sort of in his 40s now or like maybe they were both 50s or whatever but they went back into the fort and Got a bunch of extra goodies with the players escorting these two They went to meet the young ranger the younger of the two rangers mother, which was a mermaid It was inside the secret pool within the cloud fort That was it.

[Speaker 2]
It was a very long impromptu like family reunion arc that I don't think anybody was expecting That turned out very sweet Somebody is messaging this snuggly asking why he was kicked out and it's one guy who I thought was like maybe part of the Who I thought was like associated with up yet. Well the other two that I kicked out and Let's see here And I was telling snuggly I'm like, yeah, it's like you I think he's like He's connected to the majors or each fun guy sort of moved him He's like, I don't remember the majors guy. We see the Catholic dude who couldn't get pussy if he was in a pet store I was like, oh Oh Yeah, damn Whoa It was you don't have to apologize that it was hilarious Well, he wouldn't do the advice thing was the big fucking problem for everybody Yeah Well, that was the so that was actually kind of fucked up of that lady because she like went in

[Speaker 1]
I've been on the other side of that one before and like I was like, mmm, that's not good.

[Speaker 2]
That's not good You shouldn't do that shit Yeah If it was like normal, I could just call him a dumbass Well, here's the thing. He's 90. He's like 18 years or I think he was like Maybe 17 at this thing.

[Speaker 1]
He was very young very and this lady is like 2620 like that was the only reason I was like Like not I was like The reason I was like not cool with it was because it was so like This is this is a lesson that like men are supposed to learn in their high school years and from women their own age And not for women who?

[Speaker 2]
nearing 30 Older woman came up to date him and And then kept going hot and cold Yeah, I Mean Yeah, yeah, that was him. I just felt like like you would be the funniest choice in the moment See, so I was completely correct That's what you're saying Here I kicked his original account just to get in case he gets that back But I was bullying him for a while, but that was the problem is like oh I shouldn't be bullying in like a kid for this long. I should like this is funny, but I should stop at some point And that meant that he had to be he had to be removed Get to be gone because I wasn't going to stop if he was still here Yeah I'm trying to be like funny about it How do you expect to stand against Satan the devil if you can't talk to women also the devil like this?

there's I'm like trying to reach him with his language and he's still just not getting it with the ovaries No, no, no, it's not talking. Stop talking. You're young.

You're in a dangerous situation right now. Stop. Stop talking I'm gonna save you.

You're in danger. I am the danger Of the other guys messaging me Not really, I barely know you and the other guy I talked to you Oh, that's okay. I know I know who this guy was actually Actually, no, I'll invite this guy back in he just like his first language is in English that's where he talks weird There we go.

All right. So while we're waiting for other and for Landy, I Think we're gonna get started in another like 10 minutes here Very least I can Have a soul here start chatting books up Who oh That's hilariously fucked up it is going to be a funny night, I'm ready for it Oh, it was marked as banned. Let me fix that No That's user settings.

I need to get this person out Go ahead and drop yourselves to the Left and well, you could drop yourselves on and either of these two rock three rocks, I guess There once was a monkey Mm-hmm Yeah, that was it that was a plan That's a charming way of not taking no for an answer Persistent reinforce itself. There's a And they were Things oh, there we go If you don't bring them in this is their home planet the cobalt's come from the world of ions Or maybe if you just want like hide them in the background during like combat situations like that's generally fine Yeah, there's beer Oh, it's kind of like unbanned somebody Oh Bands think I'll pay. All right Most of the people band in here is are like Pro-fan, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Let's some people band in here just folks who like joined and left immediately or people have like in in a bunch of times to like So I've been in a bunch of times and like never started a character, but there was a link shit They joined and just leave immediately.

[Speaker 2]
I'm like, okay. Okay. Oh, yeah That's like most of them Oh Also, why can I not here It's I Don't want the volume mixer.

I just want like the thing that lets me choose where the volume is coming out of like soon Are you guys talking All right, sweet Okay, there we go, I was trying to figure out why the music wasn't working on my end It might possibly be

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and add yourselves that we've issued oh my god, it's gritty

[Speaker 9]
This might reload your thing for a second

[Speaker 2]
Fucking excellent timing You doing okay Don't know very well

[Speaker 9]
Oh

[Speaker 3]
Anyway, I'm here now

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, perfect timing we were just talking about you yeah Yes, actually no actually don't let your start this true and factual God I'm very curious how you manage that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, that's just me

[Speaker 2]
It's rough buddy All right, either just let me know once you're in and I will I will explain everything Oh There it is, okay You guys have after a very very long journey

[Speaker 1]
Finally made it to the outskirts of the world of Aya it is huge you can see a planet that looks like the mass of of your home systems equivalent of Jupiter and it is orbiting This gas giant this gas giant is orbiting the planet that para and Grinny well Grinny might not know But Grinny would be pretty might be from here, but Grinny might not be a rocket scientist the para would know The the planet this gas giant is orbiting is ion. It's earth-like in appearance It just happens to be hundreds of times larger And The draconic magic is what keeps creatures in This what keeps creatures of float will say on that planet.

It's very much attuned to draconic blood and draconic ancestry Many folks have made it to the outskirts These border regions where you could see into physical space around the world of Aya, which is trapped in Well, it's not really trapped. It's more Presented in a rather beautiful nebula surrounding it this is where the other adjacent planes of the host world in this case ion can be pursued and in here it is Here it's ion and you guys are looking for the brilliance But in order to pass into it you guys have to pass some trials brilliance has to determine Your worth in ion is a planet very concerned with the concepts of honor And for this purpose one of your old friends has been Sent to judge you fairly because only a friend can do so and so Grigere is waiting for your boat Standing on a rock inside the nebula here. It's the beautiful view of ion Waiting for your call as you were outside his range of blindsight and he's not there.

He's not sure if you've arrived yet How long have you been standing there Oh, we just got here, don't worry. Oh That's okay you can float but not yet This room you can float from just rock to rock you'll have an easy enough time doing it You will Well, no you won't and I encourage not Endangering yourself before the real danger begins I've been elected by the Magic of these planes in order to actually carry you through to brilliance you have a very important task ahead of you and I'd like to see you complete it before the Fane actually reverses most of your progress here the way to Keep it all from having it having been a waste and that's his hope as well No, are you ready? Oh I hadn't explained it. Yes.

I have to fight you It's nothing it's nothing personal or anything like that you recall our first our first meeting was actually by submitting to you folks Return my post Oh No, no, oh you're right my mother wasn't there for that but some of your companions did Give me a proper did well on me proper will say and Return me to my post at the banyan camp. This is proper if you want to bring a dragon back to their Obligations you have to prove some martial prowess in the meantime So I certainly you could do so by killing me. I would ask that you not do that for obvious reasons Very simple very simple Think of it like a like a boxing match except the opponent that's many times stronger and Probably more handsome though.

My eyes have been out for some time. I can't really confirm this He is blind he has two massive scorch marks where his eyes are supposed to be They look like partially disintegrated That is hilarious Mimosa, what did you roll?

[Speaker 4]
That is so bad It's a really funny so the Objective here is pretty simple.

[Speaker 1]
You folks are gonna try to deal non-lethal damage and a portion of that non-lethal damage Is going to get sort of keeled back to him round by round But every time at the end of each round if he's taken this non-lethal damage Or that you guys can decide to do lethal or non-lethal damage if you do non-lethal damage Then I roll a percentile dice against like the percentage of his hit points That that non-lethal damage has gone and if I go below that Then he will submit So basically you're setting Your non-lethal damage is like a DC that he has to that if he fails he will submit That make sense Yes Wasn't very confident.

Yes Hey, lady It's me. Hello. Also good timing.

You're gonna drop your character on there. You can free escalate a bit of combat Also, not all of his features are going to be on here I'm stealing some abilities from the Pathfinder 2 Eagle Dragon It just felt thematically appropriate

[Speaker 5]
Wait

[Speaker 1]
And add yourself to initiative I'm not expecting it to be a big fight either ironically enough this This fight lady lady's character has not even been added yet and already it is down to average In difficulty it was challenging before para was Was added which I find hilarious I

[Speaker 3]
Destroy your balance

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine

[Speaker 6]
Should I take Monk off? No Don't even want to And Monk's pretty good for like beating people Especially non-lethally Can't wait to shoot this guy with my Vampiric But not this one Why is it? I'm gonna fix this token Lieutenant Laslo Token displays as friendly There we go Rory you have my full attention now.

[Speaker 8]
Um, we're in space. Yes I think Rana was vaguely in space Is that who? What am I?

[Speaker 1]
Sure Rana can be in space I'll explain uh I'll explain At the end of combat You folks when you folks move you can either move on the rocks themselves Or you can jump to another rock I've not proven to do so But uh if you have the ability to fly you can also fly Around As if you were flying

[Speaker 6]
If anybody wants to hop on My Has a saddle that can carry two people

[Speaker 4]
Okie dokie

[Speaker 9]
Very good

[Speaker 1]
Just drop a character down whatever character I'm gonna add you to initiative There we go Phineas are you you are muted Regardless I am going to begin We can just get started here Meaning that Hera Is Around

[Speaker 3]
Ok Um let's see Are there special rules For spells being non lethal Or are they just kinda lethal

[Speaker 1]
They're just kinda lethal

[Speaker 3]
Ok So on the defensive I'm Gonna do I took Too long They got bored and left

[Speaker 6]
Phineas

[Speaker 9]
Muted

[Speaker 1]
Phineas you are still Muted if you're trying to talk Like on discord

[Speaker 3]
This is what I'm gonna Do This cool little Auris spell Hmm

[Speaker 1]
Vitality Hey

[Speaker 7]
Hey can you guys hear me

[Speaker 9]
I can I can hear you now

[Speaker 7]
I am driving home So I'm on the car

[Speaker 1]
Ok It sounds like it I will narrate for you As time goes on

[Speaker 4]
All our characters are supposed to have a long rest

[Speaker 1]
Yeah you can do long yeah that's totally fine Alright so Peridot you cast aura of vitality Are you doing anything with the bonus action

[Speaker 3]
Um Well everyone's all Freshly healed Um he's not within my Range I think I'm gonna forgo that bonus action For now

[Speaker 1]
So be it At the end of your turn I'm gonna have my boy here Take a legendary action And Do nothing actually I don't need to be near people For that So he is going to fly And then He's a breath weapon

[Speaker 6]
Of course Cause we're all fucking clustered up like idiots

[Speaker 5]
Oh no this is

[Speaker 6]
Oh ok we wouldn't have been saved anyway

[Speaker 9]
Fuck Fuck Fuck It hurts Hold on do I have

[Speaker 1]
Oh what a nice roll Uh the dragon Sol Brasier has just moved in And Evasion are you thinking

[Speaker 4]
I think both of them have half bonus Yes I know I'm just annoyed at my rolls Tonight

[Speaker 1]
It's funny I think more than half the party has evasion Sol Brasier

[Speaker 6]
Is pretty funny to think of

[Speaker 1]
It does Alright so for those of you who failed 67 fire damage Half of you succeeded

[Speaker 6]
Alright bye Laslo

[Speaker 1]
Has Laslo been Laslo been incapacitated He can be moved to the coffin

[Speaker 6]
Anyways

[Speaker 1]
That's Sol Brasier's turn Oh you misunderstand Not needed Being non lethal So He's going to at the end of his turn Use a legendary action to tail attack you Well that is his turn And his legendary action Bringing us to Rana

[Speaker 8]
Well I don't got this Now see can Mimosa stab him This turn On her turn Okay Rana is going to hold her action And as Mimosa is about to strike The dragon With her best attack She will use channel divinity path to the grave Which will make him vulnerable to the Attack I have pinged it there in chat Very good

[Speaker 4]
You do know I am last in line right That's okay

[Speaker 8]
I'm waiting until it's your turn I'm waiting And then she will use her reaction She's holding her action

[Speaker 1]
You can do bonus action things on your turn So if you're looking for a bonus action You can do that While Corpus go

[Speaker 5]
You can jump over

[Speaker 1]
Yes all these rocks are places That you can jump to If you have the normal ability to fly The way you are also able to Think Baldur's Gate 3 Like in the astral plane Which is where you are right now

[Speaker 5]
And jumping is an action Is it not so

[Speaker 1]
No you just use your movement You can just choose to go there If you're going to make attacks in the sky Roll And then monk will be up next

[Speaker 5]
Let's see Does it have to make a roll

[Speaker 1]
Oh absolutely

[Speaker 5]
It just has Really you know That's correct 9

[Speaker 1]
To what 15

[Speaker 5]
9 plus 16 That is 25

[Speaker 1]
Alright so we'll use a legendary resistance

[Speaker 2]
Alright monk

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 4]
Seems like you're moving closer I just want to use an action

[Speaker 1]
If a rock is within Your movement then your character Just jumps over to it

[Speaker 4]
Um

[Speaker 1]
You probably are Uh it's The icon is big though

[Speaker 9]
Okay Oh

[Speaker 4]
So this should make sure That you can't Heal But I don't see where it is Can't replay and hit point Before the start of your next turn There it is

[Speaker 1]
It does not Yeah it must not be targeting him You have to press T on him Or click on him And then press T I also don't know

[Speaker 4]
I don't figure out why it works for

[Speaker 1]
The other attacks Alright 30 definitely hits Alright 3 definitely hits Oh he does hit AC 19 There it is So it's letting me find the damage Directly to him What about the other hits Or other damage

[Speaker 4]
He uh It was 13 and 23 Little damage Nope

[Speaker 1]
Oh you rolled a D20 for Damage accidentally

[Speaker 4]
Oh There you go

[Speaker 9]
There

[Speaker 1]
It briefly for some reason said it was targeting Taris Oh as a legendary action

[Speaker 9]
Very good

[Speaker 1]
Creatures within 10 feet

[Speaker 8]
How do I target this Fucker

[Speaker 1]
Is nothing happening When you guys press T

[Speaker 8]
We can't select his token at all

[Speaker 3]
Yeah what I've done is I've targeted Mimosa because When I hit T on him It should go away Once I actually target him

[Speaker 4]
And it's just not going

[Speaker 1]
You might have to reload Or refresh

[Speaker 4]
You have to reload

[Speaker 8]
I also

[Speaker 4]
Oh I was just Being a brat

[Speaker 8]
That's really weird It's extra weird because like

[Speaker 3]
There's like a border around everyone else

[Speaker 1]
Here's the thing What's his face

[Speaker 3]
Does it count as a ship

[Speaker 1]
Toggle target state does that work

[Speaker 3]
Toggle target state

[Speaker 1]
I did then go ahead and re-roll your Your attack Just to see if it targets him Taris Just to see That's so weird

[Speaker 6]
Don't worry James I fucking hope it hits

[Speaker 9]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
I see you targeted Korpis What the fuck

[Speaker 9]
Yo

[Speaker 1]
There it is now it's targeting the gold dragon Whatever you did there

[Speaker 6]
In addition to that I'm gonna throw a spell I wanna See this dude laugh

[Speaker 1]
Also I need Monk To make me a deck save

[Speaker 4]
Oh sorry That should be Easy

[Speaker 9]
Oh shit

[Speaker 1]
I will use another legendary resistance To artificially prolong this event Thirteen damage to you And Monk are pushed

[Speaker 6]
Oh I'm gonna also have

[Speaker 1]
Monk is hit You can just have her add the damage

[Speaker 4]
You said how much damage Thirteen

[Speaker 1]
Okay And then maybe save I have to make the con save Which I might Yeah so I have the poison damage

[Speaker 6]
Okay that's fifteen Piercing damage not forty

[Speaker 1]
And then twelve Still twelve poison damage on top of Fifteen piercing so that comes out to Twenty seven No cause it's pushing back

[Speaker 4]
You just got pushed ten feet

[Speaker 1]
I would say go Fuck yourself actually If I had to think about it Alright What do we got Frog is everything good I think everything's good Alrighty I need to move my dragon

[Speaker 8]
Me bullshit

[Speaker 4]
Oh yay Yeah you exist I exist Okay

[Speaker 9]
Umm

[Speaker 1]
Been a great deal of stabbing And such dealt to this Skull dragon so far

[Speaker 4]
Oh wait what am I Are you supposed to do

[Speaker 1]
Are you supposed to hit it with something Really fucking nasty And Landy will be casting a channel divinity To make it vulnerable

[Speaker 4]
Okay okay Well I'm not gonna hit Sorry

[Speaker 1]
Yeah I don't think black cruiser really does Non legal

[Speaker 4]
Yeah

[Speaker 9]
Ow

[Speaker 1]
Fuck buddy Natural two that's really rough Mimosa after this Dragon has pushed everybody else away Mimosa has moved to chase Attempting to Stab at her buddy non legally Lead the dragon into submission

[Speaker 4]
Ah okay

[Speaker 9]
Umm You can do it

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah is that all of them

[Speaker 9]
No

[Speaker 1]
Oh boy cause remember Whatever ends up being all Of them will be doubled You're rolling double the dice and then you're doubling The total of everything

[Speaker 9]
I'm really glad you didn't use black

[Speaker 4]
No I she would never ever ever This

[Speaker 1]
Just for people And we're talking really fucking risky

[Speaker 4]
Yeah Does this count as an ally

[Speaker 1]
Uh yes yeah Absolutely I've had at least two people Leave the server because they thought that Rogues should not get sneak attack from Or familiars nearby

[Speaker 4]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
I was very willing to Alright so you got 38 twice Which is Um 76 Which itself doubled 152 Now the gold dragon has Wait wait wait Apply I think it has resistance To one of these it has resistance to the fire damage Okay So it's 35 Um 38 and 35 Alrighty Okay that's fine Um so that's 76 So that comes out really to 146 Uh Of it's 154 Remaining hit points Now assuming that's non lethal damage That gives it No opportunity to That gives soul grazier absolutely no opportunity To save Versus the Submission check The thing about This is my bastardized version of the AD&D Uh rules for making dragons Submit where you could like choose to do non lethal damage And some of the non lethal damage will be Refunded to them Healed basically But you kind of set like a DC for them based on the percentage of their Hit points If they roll under that DC Then they surrender to you And like submit to you They're like oh wrong adventurer I must Serve them clearly That's kind of what's going on here Uh except of course a DC There's no beating a DC of 142 with um Their 146 With percentile dice

[Speaker 8]
Does he have a secondary class in Ballast and he can use all of his Hit dice

[Speaker 1]
No he does not I'm

[Speaker 4]
Gonna use my bonus action To disengage

[Speaker 9]
That's fine

[Speaker 1]
So he does so that is the end of the combat You have succeeded Oh yay!

Yeah no that's what I meant he has 8 hit points Oh that's not good If this was a real combat you could have Also just killed him there with your books Oh okay He has 8 hit points left I realized Rana would have had to move closer to do that Is that fine still?

[Speaker 8]
That's totally fine Well within her movement Well The last thing I'll do this campaign Is help Nessie deal 140 Damage in one attack Yeah!

[Speaker 1]
There we go Alright so Yeah Yeah What was that Scroll back up here Yeah Are you feeling alright? Yeah Oh That was rough Um I'm happy it was you I appreciate that The skill and precision in which you Prove yourself worthy Of uh Of an escort of Creatures so powerful Is it I get my age Anything else Hmm Are we allowed to heal you? Yes I mean It's It's legal If you're asking Not strictly necessary But Not strictly necessary by our bylaws If you feel as though you must You know The brilliance does not frown upon

[Speaker 2]
Compassion

[Speaker 4]
Good

[Speaker 2]
Thank you Excellent

[Speaker 1]
Sure as a gentleman Was narrating beforehand I realize that some of you are not familiar With this planet I see a Small cobalt I've never seen before And I also see Perra As you all know the cobalts of your world Are actually from this one My home world as well Ion is the Is the The bigger you'll notice behind me You'll see a gas giant Orbiting a much larger planet An impossibly large planet That's terrestrial like your own Except Many many many many many Many times larger It has to be in order to accommodate creatures of my size And all the food we eat Compensates for this The magic of this place Keeps us afloat And keeps us from being crushed by the gravity Normally this is where I'd be Preparing you folks For some kind of talismans Or infusions of draconic blood To let you survive On the planet's surface But we're not going down to the planet We're going to Brilliance And it's not impacted by the By the crushing gravity Of the planet itself The whole reason we Sorry go ahead

[Speaker 4]
I just said interesting

[Speaker 1]
Yeah the I mean it is It's been some time since I've been able to return I was last year I'm pretty sure I was still in my egg Actually the last time I was here

[Speaker 8]
Oh wow

[Speaker 1]
Very interesting memory The reason the planes here Require you to Proceed in a trial by combat Is because you will have to leave things behind In the reflection pools And skunk manin Which is the It's called the pools of reflection Is what it roughly translates to In your tongues This is a place where You'll face memories Of those long past You've fought plenty of dragons It will It will mostly be dragons And you'll be forced to leave Pieces of yourself behind Usually magic Can also be memories but usually magic And they are placed back into the world Often where you Left them His while he's talking His tail just slowly Curls around monk Uh Just unthinking Just starts like Squeezing a little bit

[Speaker 4]
Uh can Are there plants? Can I help?

What's going on? Are there plants? What's that?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry can you say again?

[Speaker 4]
What's that? He's starting to shake his leg What's that?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh I was just straightening out His back I uh hurt him earlier I threw him against the rocks There you go It kind of like sets Corpus back down Corpus you can breathe again

[Speaker 5]
Ah thank you thank you

[Speaker 9]
Excellent

[Speaker 1]
Now this is going to be a We're going to be on something Of a time limit but it's fine Uh the brilliance of Ion Mostly follows the laws of other brilliances It's a plane of fire We're going to be Moving through There's going to be pools of mercury And these pools are going to Basically accept memories and magic From you and you'll be able to Choose if you can manifest A strong enough memory you can actually choose To leave these Your items in the world In that specific place now normally This would be a kind of fun fetch quest That adventurers can set for themselves For you in Particular Where Zephain is about to restart the clock On his original Insane plan to Coat the valley in frost At the behest of a Giant spider crab aberration And in order to stop the Giant spider crab aberration From completely taking over his mind He's restarting the whole thing So I would think very carefully about Where you're going to Where you're going to leave Leave your belongings Because that's going to impact how quickly you can Get back up to speed And get on par with Zephain

[Speaker 6]
Why would we leave memories?

[Speaker 1]
Why would you leave memories?

[Speaker 6]
That's a good question Are we going to forget everything?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that you are And normally people who left memories will do so If they Went with something that we Gave Because the pools will pick places for you But you can override that with Strong enough memory Normally that consumes the memory And you're going to find it along with the item But As far as I can tell That's not going to be the case for you So we'll lose our items When we reset?

[Speaker 4]
If we go back to the beginning

[Speaker 5]
You'll be like time travelers

[Speaker 1]
In effect Except for the most part You'll be the only ones who are aware of what's going on

[Speaker 5]
That's about The same as every time

[Speaker 1]
There's some benefits to it Memories can be shared by people I'll be sending some of mine back To myself So I don't forget about all this Dragons are naturally Resistant to this kind of interference With their minds but I'd like to give myself A better chance to know What's going on Who knows, if you leave something Useful behind for other people You might find it easier to persuade them to your draws Besides that Is everybody Understanding of That's the first part of our task here The second part is the reason for your journey here To begin with But before we get to that Is everybody somewhat clear On what I've mentioned so far?

[Speaker 6]
So like We give up these items And then continue fighting? That's correct There'll be a place to do so Each time Oh boy Well this doesn't happen every day How many items Or whatever do we have to give up? Pass?

[Speaker 5]
All of them, I'm assuming

[Speaker 1]
Well at the End of the trials most of your Items will be Collected from you

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
I think this is somewhat abnormal Going to the fact that They're going to Reset things This magic is kind of Wafting off of you My understanding is It's going to A lot of this By the way is not like me guessing This is information that's been passed on to me By a fairy dragon Yes he's been watching your progress

[Speaker 6]
Does he have a name?

[Speaker 1]
Colonel Butterbee He's not showing himself Because he looks like a draconic chicken He's deeply offended by my having said so Well he sounds lovely You hear a voice from up on Sol Brasier's shoulder You think so? Of course, yes I want everybody to make me a DC21 Wisdom saving throw No no no To not laugh?

[Speaker 4]
That's correct Does Blackrazor give me the advantage?

[Speaker 1]
Blackrazor's going to fail Oh no! No!

[Speaker 2]
Yo I'm going to make Glimmer No!

[Speaker 6]
Somebody left him

[Speaker 9]
Oh there you go

[Speaker 1]
That was really close

[Speaker 4]
Can I use My charisma or something To play the laugh off It's so good to finally meet you

[Speaker 9]
Sure

[Speaker 4]
Like the joyous of meeting a new friend

[Speaker 6]
Paris is not even going to try She would totally do that if she cared

[Speaker 1]
So most of you Fall over In hysteria Because you get the idea You know how T-Rexes are the ancestors of chickens In an oversimplified And very long Chain of events kind of way That's what this Creature reminds you of This fairy dragon It's just It looks like a T-Rex It similarly has these Stubby forearms It's just The body proportions are just all Chicken Of the gossamer wings of a fairy dragon And scales Instead of feathers He does look very offended And with Mimosa you may make your Your persuasion check

[Speaker 4]
Okay Is that enough?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah A Black Razor is laughing hysterically In your mind Things like If you killed him I think I'd promise the soul back Hell that's the most disgusting creature I've ever seen

[Speaker 4]
Hello It's so good I'm so glad to meet you

[Speaker 1]
Yes He's ignoring the laughter around him It's kind of zeroing in on the person The person's not laughing at him Ignoring the The wyvern is going like The wyvern sounds like a dog That's like trying to throw up

[Speaker 2]
A kiwi

[Speaker 1]
Evil also lives in the branch

[Speaker 4]
Oh I didn't make them for Monk Okay hang on That's fine

[Speaker 1]
I'm really surprised Monk made it

[Speaker 4]
Monk looks like he stumbles and he Steps on Hortus' foot

[Speaker 1]
Yes yes I am Affiliated with Sephadon's court I'm an emissary For Ivorians It was a Pleasure to meet your acquaintance But yes this is the rundown I've been given of all the magic You're supposed to encounter In the other planes there At least as far as the pits of reflection are concerned Of course I understand you have a Passenger That you're trying to fix Before everything goes to hell Yes Do you recall her name? Does she not have one?

Is that the other thing?

[Speaker 4]
I don't think she had one

[Speaker 3]
I think we just knew her as the lieutenant

[Speaker 1]
That's Good So I have a I have a question for you Because you have a very important decision to make And you don't have to make it right now I would like you to think on whether You'd like this poor girl to be Renewed in a way that Retains her memory of what's happened And she Enters the adventuring life Much as you Or if she goes back to a kind of Abnormal civilian Posited somewhere back into the world

[Speaker 5]
Come on

[Speaker 1]
Concerned Well besides that Are you folks ready to Enter the plane of brilliance? Excellent I hope that you are prepared Because there's going to be a There's going to be There's going to be a There's going to be a privilege that very few mortals From your world have gotten to experience Especially on account of the raging inferno And the portal opens up In the astral plane here And you feel this wave of the most Intense heat you've ever felt In your life that Feels like you should be burning That you should be burning Like Your bones should have just evaporated But they're not You don't feel pain you just feel the intensity of the heat Like the world's most Powerful Fan is blowing on you

[Speaker 5]
Well guys it was nice knowing ya

[Speaker 4]
It's been It's been fun Her?

We're not gonna tell your dad

[Speaker 1]
Oh we're not we're not dying There's

[Speaker 4]
Anyways Oh that's

[Speaker 1]
That's fine I won't tell her dad either

[Speaker 5]
Well we might not be dying Our gear is Going to be semi dying

[Speaker 1]
Well your gear was going to get Taken from you anyways Something about keeping the game fair Beyond the portal which Upon entering basically Removes all of this intense All feelings of intense heat and just Turns it into a general Feeling of total pleasant I'm going to set a Template for you guys over this way for you to Drop yourselves off

[Speaker 7]
Okay I'm here

[Speaker 1]
You are greeted with a Oh there we go You're greeted with a realm that Is Gorgeous impossibly bright It looks like you're stuck inside of a gem Or crystal if you will Now All the flora and fauna is Bright you recognize A lot of the wildlife here Lots of snakes and serpents Plenty of lizards about Everything is Bisected into colors There There's going to be All the trees have a Lighter shade of brown As you like move Upwards including their leaves And such And they flow actually the leaves and Branches actually flow upwards Past the trees middle And they trend towards these different Colors down towards the bottom you see A much bluer anything that's at ground Level is like a bluer Color And the low hanging clouds Are all the same color as the nebula That encases Ion There's this light pinkish color And a lot of the animals that you can see around You have like some variation of like Brown or blue Or it's like brown or pink On the top like the top Half of the animal itself whereas Their bottom half is more towards like a blue Or like the green

[Speaker 5]
May I investigate the water Here Sure I'm assuming this is just standard investigation Nat 20

[Speaker 1]
Okay choose a memory that you have Preferably one involving a dragon Actually for this memory You could just choose Anything from the campaign

[Speaker 5]
Anything from the campaign That Corpus has himself involved in or Any character

[Speaker 1]
Whichever one you could come up with in the next 30 seconds

[Speaker 5]
Edmund fought a Dragon and I remember that fight Very clearly because there's a form Of rivalry between the two That's the memory

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty so you See the horde Of this blue dragon that you folks Fought earlier I need everybody to pick a magic item to cast Into the water Perfectly reflective sheen

[Speaker 6]
After we Cast this one will we have another Opportunity to cast another one

[Speaker 1]
Yes You will have several opportunities in fact

[Speaker 7]
Are these Brilliance characters Should I bring Leary and herself

[Speaker 1]
You bring either one of them Because more cool can like burn To the Get somebody to you guys Quickly Press the wrong button like six times It was just fucking Sheet

[Speaker 6]
That's a good idea

[Speaker 4]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
I set The default sheet to like the Well The default NPC sheet that shouldn't change Yours But maybe it up maybe Updated it I don't know

[Speaker 7]
I'm guessing Consumables don't count Permanent magic item

[Speaker 1]
You toss anything Well Nah you gotta do like It's gotta be an item item

[Speaker 7]
I'll toss Plus one right here

[Speaker 1]
As that means that like everybody's gonna be downing All their consumables here at the end Non-stop scrolls

[Speaker 7]
Should I just delete it off my sheet Or is there anything you want us to do To track it in particular

[Speaker 1]
To track it Don't delete it off your sheet Just don't use it

[Speaker 7]
I'll rename it Cast into The pool

[Speaker 1]
Yeah that's fine You guys felt A wetness And finding that you had not soiled Yourselves you actually just Found a These bits of mercury were like Pouring off your person And seeping into the pool Next to you And you saw them reappear Inside the horde of this Blue dragon Has everybody selected an item Anybody else Rana you need to select one Lirion do you need to select one

[Speaker 8]
I think I think Oh okay

[Speaker 1]
That's fine If you guys need to If you guys want to cheese it By giving each other items you can also do that I don't particularly Care But I did wait specifically Until this one was finished to Tell you that And then I need you all to add yourselves To the initiative Because the memory Of the blue dragon arrives This is the one that beat the shit out of Edmund It was not a fair fight he beat the shit out of Edmund Edmund couldn't do anything about it Because he's a little barbarian and he's landlocked Ah shit Don't think too hard about this one guys You could end it pretty quickly I'm guessing

[Speaker 5]
I call this my mobile

[Speaker 9]
For Mimosa

[Speaker 1]
Gobble around it appears to be Corpus Please tell me that this time the King thing is working

[Speaker 3]
This one's targetable

Monk you have advantage

Oh

[Speaker 1]
You've just been granted advantage Oh yeah sure Oh yeah cause you missed the first one Oh wow That's rough buddy Yep If you didn't have blind side All these melee attacks would have had advantage anyways

[Speaker 9]
Oh yeah

[Speaker 2]
Another one

[Speaker 1]
And anything else for you You have Mimosa up next So you don't have to worry about it too much

[Speaker 4]
You have an extra attack

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
Harris make me a DC 15 deck save

[Speaker 5]
No

Jesus Not black razor It's from the The extra attack is not from the spider It's from the snake Also I think you only did the sneak attack damage And not like the regular black razor damage Well I did No you rolled an attack with it twice Damn it You're so used to the total being really high No I'm just There you go And I can see Not that I blame you Because the number was pretty fucking close

[Speaker 9]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
Okay so you take half damage You take half of 31 Which is uh You take 16 lightning damage Uh Garrus And the dragon is looking bad

[Speaker 5]
They don't feel so good

[Speaker 4]
Okay so I get the extra attack because of just having My My dagger

[Speaker 1]
I think you have I think you have to have I think you have to have an equipment

[Speaker 4]
Okay I So I just I can do it

[Speaker 1]
You have to be stabbing with the snake dagger

[Speaker 4]
Okay that's okay

[Speaker 1]
Alternatively you can also In one of these combats have black razor cast Based on you

[Speaker 1]
You do what you want I'm not gonna fucking Tell you what to do okay Oh yeah that's it

[Speaker 7]
That's 33 force damage How do you wanna do this Like Omni slash and then he just Falls apart like the guy cut With lasers in Resident Evil

[Speaker 1]
Alright solid In this realm It does an additional 1d8 Of any of the three damage types That you would like it to You get to choose one of it's Three damage types that's normally 1d8 And change that to 2d8 Because you are in brilliance right now Your lightsaber is Lightsabering even harder

[Speaker 5]
Okay buddy

[Speaker 1]
Rana you get to choose one Thing that you get to do at the beginning of the Next combat For free You don't have to choose right now Because the combat has just ended But I would like people to pick A pool and move themselves around the map As they push

[Speaker 6]
Alright what about this pool

[Speaker 1]
This pool Okay you can Your I get to I get to pick one Karas You could substitute a memory of course But the memory for Karas I believe is going To be The willow of sun This is where you and your brother Were You and your brother and your entire crew were Attacked by a huntsman Of one of the older courts The huntsmen are very dangerous And they track you across time and space They are the terminators Of the fey world

[Speaker 6]
Oh no

[Speaker 1]
They're not things you kill They're things you avoid desperately

[Speaker 6]
How do they kill

[Speaker 1]
Oh the way they kill They normally Take you into the Dreaming into the mists and hedges That make up the borders Of the fey wild and they stuff you Full of metaphysical thorns Until you grow into the Sides of the planar boundaries Holding you Yeah no it's bad

[Speaker 6]
R.I.P Okay So describe it

[Speaker 2]
Well there's that

[Speaker 1]
You could choose a different memory If you wish

[Speaker 6]
Is this a memory to just let go of

[Speaker 1]
No This is a memory that's going to come face you

[Speaker 6]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
And the huntsman that killed Your brother took the form Of a something like a dragon

[Speaker 6]
Oh okay

[Speaker 1]
It's pixie season Carolyn

[Speaker 6]
It's not

[Speaker 1]
No bag Limits I've got a few in my bag already

[Speaker 2]
Alright anything else for your turn

[Speaker 6]
No but I am Definitely going to Use my bonus I'm definitely going to Vicious mockery this motherfucker next Absolutely

[Speaker 1]
Alright Rana you have one action that is like Your held action for the channel But you also have your normal turn Like How would you like to proceed

[Speaker 8]
Yeah I'll just cast Tom on it Solid

[Speaker 2]
Ah shit

[Speaker 1]
Not great Alright anything with your bonus action Before Lirian is up

[Speaker 8]
Nah I'm all good

[Speaker 1]
Alright Lirian Doobie in Videos Youtube man Oh shit

[Speaker 5]
Hold him

[Speaker 2]
That's failed Carolyn

[Speaker 7]
That's it for me

[Speaker 1]
Okay at the end of my turn I get another wisdom saving throw

[Speaker 8]
Yes

[Speaker 1]
Moving on to the next person's turn I assume this is We're going to double double it again I see Any attacks within 5 feet are an automatic Critical hit Mimosa you might be muted

[Speaker 4]
Oh no I didn't realize you were talking to me

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage on it But yeah you auto crit You're hitting it with And And It's done the double double again

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 4]
So the damage is a crit

[Speaker 1]
The damage is a crit And just go ahead and roll that damage And all the stuff Roll your sneak attack Because that's probably going to be

[Speaker 4]
Yeah I'm going to do that next

[Speaker 5]
I'm just going in order Oh god it's order

[Speaker 1]
It's the first The first one is not just a crit It's also getting channel divinity

[Speaker 4]
Okay do you want me to Is it normal damage on my sneak attack

[Speaker 1]
Or crit The provoking attack is a critical So that means that the sneak attack Is also

[Speaker 2]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
Um And Alright so you're So that's like the 39 plus 95 Is 124 How the fuck is that You have like 96 Sneak attack Normally And then you Holy shit okay so So that's 120 Yeah that's Um That's 124 And then with Rana's channel divinity Keeping that in the chat Creature Next time you and Alec hit With the attack Has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage And then the curse ends So That's 124 doubled Which is more than it's normal hit points It has 127 hit points left That would have been Nearly enough to kill it Alone And it's at like half hit points So you did like 248 Damage to it How would you like To do this

[Speaker 4]
Um He Slices his head off

[Speaker 5]
In the most disappointed way possible

[Speaker 1]
He watches a bunch of worms And cockroaches Spill out of the You are nasty today

[Speaker 9]
It's a

[Speaker 1]
This is the creature You watch a bunch of worms and cockroaches spill out of this Thing as it just kind of withers And shrivels up Back into this image In the Feywild Some of the deepest recesses That nevertheless were a A willow tree Shaped like a golden ball And emitting The light of the sun It's kind of nestled And tucked away And there's a Go ahead and cast some magic items

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah

[Speaker 1]
Uh Charis' brother has not disappeared

[Speaker 4]
Where is he

[Speaker 1]
He's chilling out next to you Like whoa That thing was pretty fucking scary I hope our crew's okay They're probably not okay

[Speaker 6]
She's gonna poke him

[Speaker 9]
Ow

[Speaker 6]
She's kind of just stammering Like

[Speaker 4]
Oh what's the matter Charis darling Who is this Um

[Speaker 9]
Um

[Speaker 1]
I'm her brother

[Speaker 4]
Well of course hello I'm Mimosa Mimosa's just giving you time to recover

[Speaker 9]
That's a pleasure

[Speaker 1]
Ah No Feeling quite fine actually Oh well I guess It just didn't happen yet Um That did feel kind of easy for dealing with a huntsman though She just sits on a rock You take a breather if you need to I'm gonna go see if there's any wine left Inside that Contraband we were smuggling Where is it She's just gonna pull him down to sit by the rock He's not leaving Okay Alright then Rana has cast in the Pearl of Power I think I need more magic items by the way

[Speaker 2]
For the other thing as well

[Speaker 6]
Should I make a toga for him

[Speaker 2]
You can

[Speaker 6]
I don't even have a name for him Do I have a name for him

[Speaker 2]
I think you did If you look in the RP you should see it

[Speaker 1]
Corpus I think needs to toss another thing in Cause he didn't toss one into the Adult Blue Dragon thing And I don't know if Lirion tossed one in

[Speaker 5]
Probably enough Oh not this cycle Where do I go to throw them in

[Speaker 1]
What you do is you Have to go to drawing tools And then go to draw text Then you can type it on the map That way when it resets I have a rough idea Of what some of these items will be going to

[Speaker 8]
Wherever that happens to be I'm gonna need to head off now Everyone be nice hanging out Okay I've spent all of my channel divinities Anyways No worries Are you tired I need to get ready to get dinner and stuff Oh okay Yeah I just Wasn't expecting you to be up so late

[Speaker 1]
You came straight from work No I appreciate that man I'll see you next time

[Speaker 5]
Bye bye See ya man

[Speaker 1]
I like the shampoo here

[Speaker 6]
Hold on How many more times are we going to be able to cast things in

[Speaker 1]
How many pulls are left

[Speaker 4]
Several One

[Speaker 1]
You can't be tossing your gun in there In the first one Cause you were shooting it during this one Yeah sorry I didn't I don't know why I put that there

[Speaker 4]
I didn't even toss that in I tossed the quest Oh

[Speaker 1]
The easiest way to strategically do it Is when you get to a Pull you can like contribute A memory To it and like try to contribute a memory And like override it So it goes to like the place Of the memory Okay

[Speaker 4]
Okay

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I'm still understanding

[Speaker 1]
Okay um

[Speaker 3]
So like even though this was Karis' memory We can still contribute our own memory Or is that not

[Speaker 1]
Oh no sorry what I mean is Each time you go up to a pool We'll take the next one as an example You could choose one person to go up to this pool

[Speaker 4]
Oh right now Oh yeah Okay which pool

[Speaker 1]
Let's say the one that's Directly above you

[Speaker 4]
The Pikachu pool

[Speaker 1]
The Pikachu pool? Um

[Speaker 2]
Come on

[Speaker 4]
I got stuck under the Drop There we go

[Speaker 1]
Oh you're a dead dragon nerd

[Speaker 2]
His name is Siren No

[Speaker 6]
Close enough Her name isn't actually Karis By the way She changed her name To get away from all that shit

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 6]
It was Lyra I think I wrote that somewhere

[Speaker 1]
You did write that somewhere that does sound familiar Alright so who went up there was that Monk or was that

[Speaker 4]
Yeah it was Monk

[Speaker 1]
Alright so

[Speaker 4]
Oh more drop

[Speaker 1]
Monk Oh I've got decisions to make Monk goes up And Let's see here I have like Two choices for Monk I feel like Gotta be One of these two So Monk You see the image of Dendar the Night Serpent Hurtling Through space Chasing The bird of tematum That is the memory that you're That is evoked right now by this pool What Monk can do is Monk can try to override this with a different Memory And Monk can And by doing so would Pass a different Or choose a different location Or different person For these magic items to be sent nearby

[Speaker 4]
Can I choose Pineus

[Speaker 1]
Well Pineus has been a lot of places But you gotta like choose a memory Like a session a thing that happened

[Speaker 4]
Alright well When Pineus got left behind Oh When Pineus got left behind in that session

[Speaker 1]
Pineus did get left behind in that session That was in Monk's memory Monk wasn't there Because he left Pineus behind

[Speaker 4]
Okay how about the The night they met The night he got hired

[Speaker 1]
What was the night that Christopher Pineus got hired

[Speaker 4]
It was a drunken night Getting rid of him?

[Speaker 6]
Wait hold on What are we bringing into the world here Did you bang your hiring?

[Speaker 7]
Huh?

[Speaker 4]
It's neither here nor there That's not the point

[Speaker 5]
We don't talk about what happened behind closed doors

[Speaker 4]
I was like Would that work

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to figure out like when Pineus got because I need to like Would it be a memory that had some kind of conflict To it

[Speaker 4]
I mean the conflict was him like hiring

[Speaker 1]
Was him being there Yeah sure But like where was that I don't know Anybody else can interject by the way If you have a memory to contribute

[Speaker 4]
If you have a memory Yeah I have a horrible memory

[Speaker 1]
Of like a fight or something

[Speaker 7]
Yeah We had someone In our party A traitor who turned out to be A rapist animal abuser And he picked a gun And he tried to stick his hand Down a dwarves mouth

[Speaker 4]
Okay I think that Way overrides Mug's memory Thank you very much

[Speaker 9]
I think I remember that memory

[Speaker 4]
We weren't there

[Speaker 1]
But if you'd like a refresher While I'm trying to find their character Go to town hall And you'll see two videos Oh it's that thing okay That thing not that guy That thing

[Speaker 5]
Yeah that thing Yeah

[Speaker 1]
It was too heavy Too autistic to be called a man

[Speaker 5]
We can't say that

[Speaker 1]
WF Where's the WF guy

[Speaker 4]
Let's toss that memory in the pool

[Speaker 5]
I'd also like to contribute a memory

[Speaker 1]
I hope Whoever's playing I think his name is Rolando I hope he's doing well

[Speaker 7]
Oh he was there at the beginning

[Speaker 1]
He was yeah

[Speaker 4]
He met Penny after we all Went to the Grand tree I don't remember

[Speaker 3]
That's because it didn't happen in Saffron So He just kind of showed up one day And stole your heart

[Speaker 9]
Kind of like that

[Speaker 4]
I don't know I mean any fight that had Penny or Penny would have been interesting If he kept singing that stupid song

[Speaker 1]
Yeah but you gotta pick one

[Speaker 4]
I don't remember

[Speaker 1]
That's a great memory Any fight

[Speaker 4]
He's a drunkard

[Speaker 1]
Decimus I wonder if that's a good fight

[Speaker 4]
This'll be fun What about Bar's one shot With the Hydra

[Speaker 1]
With the Hydra?

[Speaker 6]
Which one was the Hydra Oh that was the dead island Oh It's a little bit funky I love it You know what I mean? Do you see it?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
I see it, sure

[Speaker 6]
It was the closest that I could find That they looked similar They'd have a good pool to pull from

[Speaker 1]
No I think it's I think it works

[Speaker 6]
It was a good plan actually Unintended but

[Speaker 5]
And mine would have to be The hollow of Leo Claim Claim

[Speaker 1]
Yeah we can get to that I'm going to pick a wizard here Yeah I'm going to pick a wizard And it's going to be copied I don't know who I forgot who Calriss is

[Speaker 4]
I think that was a blue dragon Oh Okay Mine might not Should have done Should have done the most Amongst us like Hops in and out wherever

[Speaker 9]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
Yeah alright go ahead and add yourselves To in combat And a new one Go ahead and add yourselves once this comes up

[Speaker 4]
Alright We're going to keep the 11

[Speaker 3]
Well I stole your 10 so No Yes it says

[Speaker 9]
I stole a shitty luck For the day

[Speaker 1]
Alright this is probably going to go by Really quickly I guess these ones are going to Asheros then Alright Mr. The mushroom guy is going to have Mr. Rupert Shades is going to have An interesting collection

[Speaker 9]
Oh

[Speaker 2]
Warlock Okay You're up first

[Speaker 1]
This will go by quickly Oh god it is a shield Oh no

[Speaker 9]
It's Oh yeah

[Speaker 4]
Oh and monkeys right there Yeah And I'm pretty sure

[Speaker 1]
Spiders will not let you Alright they literally can't survive Like three rounds of you people And also it's applying damage to all of them at once So I'm just going to delete them Combat one Toss the things into Into the pyre here so this will These will be items going to A suspected Cultist within the city Of Asheros Aha

[Speaker 4]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
Now specifically ones that are in That are mostly in prison At the time that they Stalked the module technically

[Speaker 6]
Um can I

[Speaker 1]
The infernal cult was pushed out By the knives

[Speaker 6]
How easy will it be to get these

[Speaker 1]
Um Killing off an infernal cult In Pathfinder 2nd edition I feel like once you guys get like level five Um that's That's when you'll be able to challenge them Very effectively inside their Inside their own

[Speaker 6]
I probably shouldn't have put my gun into the last one How many pools are left?

[Speaker 1]
There are You've done two and there are At least well you've done three now Two Three I guess technically four Good news is that the finale is not really going to have a lot These people are Giddying in The rice fields There are also plenty of unclaimed items That are out there in the We can use those? Well Whoever's in there is going to have Actually there's not that many Funnily But um You know And thus they all Just to be clear we just murdered Multiple copies of the uh Of that annoying guy right? Yes that's correct there were three of them And they all exploded in hellfire

[Speaker 7]
And we all cheered Everybody cheered Including that person's mother

[Speaker 1]
Indeed And you see a brief glimpse of him being Tortured By a pit fiend A very familiar looking pit fiend Who looks out at you Angry that you've yet again Foiled his plans And also angry that this annoying guy Is back there and he has to Torture him for a little while So he goes away

[Speaker 7]
Who tortures who tortures Glorious Fuck that guy

[Speaker 1]
Fuck that guy so hard

[Speaker 2]
Yep a deceiver's lingerie

[Speaker 1]
Including the Including the kickstarter with night sauce Was uh was All the problems I had there were The deceiver's lingerie That was his top contribution It's a bra that makes you look like a mermaid When you put it on That is so fucking good That is so fucking good Incredible And nobody's used it the whole campaign

[Speaker 4]
There was like I When was there a chance

[Speaker 1]
Use your words

[Speaker 7]
Use your words

[Speaker 1]
You better you better fucking watch out That pit fiend just got a Just got a bra Fucking GG's like 40 Numbers that don't even make sense Hmm Taking a claw is interesting

[Speaker 7]
Oh I need to I need to donate

[Speaker 1]
Yes you do need to donate

[Speaker 4]
Mon has nothing He After he's got After that it's either zealots Recompense or his actual stats

[Speaker 3]
Do you want some hearts I have some hearthwands I could give you

[Speaker 1]
Yeah sure Yeah that's right You guys get to cheese it if you want to like trade Items to each other to contribute

[Speaker 6]
How many pools are left I don't know I keep asking

[Speaker 9]
My brain's mushy Yeah one Two

[Speaker 6]
Yeah I'm definitely going to need some items Because I have two left and I'm not partying with either of them Oh no

[Speaker 7]
Would you say we can Use scrolls No

[Speaker 3]
I mean if we don't toss them in we don't get them when we roll over right

[Speaker 1]
Um What do you mean

[Speaker 7]
Are we supposed to drop chump items Are we supposed to drop sweet items

[Speaker 1]
Well you get to The ones that you don't drop in are going to be Distributed normally Or like placed back where you found them More likely This is just an opportunity to Um Yeah but like that Whatever you don't Do whatever you don't place Intentionally is going to be Placed back where it was

[Speaker 7]
Okay

[Speaker 6]
My gun was pulled out of an asteroid

[Speaker 7]
Where's this one

[Speaker 9]
Where's this pool going

[Speaker 1]
Say again

[Speaker 7]
Do we know

[Speaker 1]
This one is going to the cultists And probably to that pit fiend that you guys Have pissed off Like repeatedly across the campaign I'm just going to mark it as pit fiend cult

[Speaker 7]
I'll drop my mess

[Speaker 2]
Really

[Speaker 7]
Well yeah cause the I kind of figure

[Speaker 2]
Oh cause then he has to find you Yeah Do the previous wheeler

[Speaker 9]
Yep

[Speaker 1]
Alright that's pretty clever You got to make him come to you now Then we get to see whether a pit fiend is Is as terrifying a proposition In Pipeline for Second Edition

[Speaker 9]
Very cool

[Speaker 3]
What is their rename

[Speaker 5]
What is their rename

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah would they be a demon A daemon or a devil

[Speaker 1]
It would be a daemon

[Speaker 3]
Well there's three Different types Oh it's called an asari now And it's a tyrant devil They are infernal dukes

[Speaker 1]
Oh no you're right it would be a devil

[Speaker 3]
Why did I say daemon They're a level 20 creature They're like one of the higher creatures Damn Oh excuse me they are the highest Creature In the devil category So he's not going to be really doable In the earlier levels

[Speaker 1]
I guess I've selected one of the bosses For campaign Alright so Next Has everybody contributed to this pool It looks like you guys have

[Speaker 7]
So we should pick a pool Because we can force the pool To go to a particular place Right by giving a memory

[Speaker 1]
Indeed Which I will make you roll for That was the one thing I fucked up with monk But yes

[Speaker 7]
Okay so we should How about on this next one we dip a bunch of our good items And pick like a A nice place

[Speaker 4]
I know Mimosa was going to think about soldiers here Their first fight

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if an adult gold dragon Is a nice fight in Under second edition It's not a particularly nice fight in 5e

[Speaker 4]
We'll find them

[Speaker 1]
That's what Sol Brasier says standing there

[Speaker 4]
Oh Oh no but you became an ally

[Speaker 1]
Yes yes but only upon you beating the shit out of me

[Speaker 4]
Oh

[Speaker 3]
If I remember correctly We didn't even attack him

[Speaker 4]
Cause if I remember

[Speaker 3]
You just like instantly rolled the he's friendly button

[Speaker 1]
I did roll like No you submitted You forced the other one to submit as well I think it was Akira had a gold dragon for a while Wait no it was Zykara Was the other one There was another There was another annoying person Who And Zykara was having trouble

[Speaker 6]
Yeah Zykara Why does that sound so familiar

[Speaker 1]
Cause he was like

[Speaker 4]
A downgraded version of Akira Jump off The second story building And made a bunch of noise that attracted The monster to us Oh my god No okay

[Speaker 1]
No that was actually a different one That was like a monk Actually maybe No that wasn't his name I know who you're thinking about that person was also removed mid session

[Speaker 3]
Yeah he was one who was there And then left and then came back But he was notorious For just like randomly disappearing Or like Not responding for like ages

[Speaker 1]
Yeah no that was frustrating Alright so that Sol Brasier will say If you're thinking of an easy memory Think of a place that was

[Speaker 9]
Oh okay The memory I was thinking about

[Speaker 3]
Was Salile Hatching Is hatching really the right word

[Speaker 1]
Hatching is definitely the right word Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Yeah Hatching Salile Is kind of what I was thinking It had those handy little treasure rooms And everything

[Speaker 1]
Salile was certainly friendly to your cause I mean your cause was Punctually her cause And she was awfully grateful to be freed from the drow Not to mention the drow themselves If you can earn the good graces Of Corgan a second time Recovering his dragons especially That will be an easier place To recover your weapon Think of the drow holding your weapon Should be fine There are plenty of worse options for them to hold it I have all confidence in you To strike them down Don't make me like an insight check Or like an arcana check or something like that Hopefully it represents your Mental intuition Could be religion Yeah, beautiful Just kind of turn your eyes Inwards to remember birthing Salile Sorry yeah hatching Salile And getting her to Like watching her sort of birth Herself out of this Once dead Coral heart Because at the very beginning of the campaign There was a spire of dead Coral towards the north end of the valley And it was Being targeted by these four beams Of necrotic energy from Drow outposts and the party went through They destroyed all the beams Life started returning to the Coral and once the last beam was destroyed Salile was returned To the The new fey lord was birthed From From the spire

[Speaker 5]
Damn I missed a lot

[Speaker 1]
The planned revenge This is March 2023 So I think Well before you were actually there Well before

[Speaker 5]
I miss some cool stuff

[Speaker 1]
Which is actually Really cool because that's one of the That's one of the things I was Thinking about because there was a dragon Encounter there

[Speaker 3]
Yeah they had those Amethyst dragons if I remember correctly

[Speaker 1]
They did and there was a favorite consort Riding on top of it Which is a fucking baller fight There's also the opportunity For me to introduce I gotta bring back the young White dragon Young white Enlightened young one white dragon Fine Everybody add like a How do I do this I mean import

[Speaker 3]
Oh are we getting companions For this one?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah you can bring out your Young white dragons Oh I don't have access to them Anymore They got Moved somewhere Do you guys see an enlightened young white dragon?

[Speaker 6]
There's three of them

[Speaker 3]
I see many of them Oh you're copying I actually only I think we only need one And then we can all just take Like the same one Okay Because they don't have the linked actor data so like They'll all be quote unquote separate

[Speaker 1]
Oh okay yeah that's fine However you guys want to do it And then just add yourselves to the initiative I'm going to place you Around the map I'm going to split you And you guys will be riding as we did that day I'll be getting a surprise Attack as I did that day Oh it was a Funny fucking day

[Speaker 4]
What day?

[Speaker 1]
The day that the That the amethyst dragon attacked There was basically a D&D Dogfight In between the spires of this Giant hole in the ground Spires sticking out From this giant hole in the ground and it was About half the party got lured Off their original track The remainder of the party Couldn't get their attention in time These guys got a surprise attack Off on the players and it was Fucking World War 1 all over it was biplanes all over again Alright those of you who are here Lirian need you to add yourself to the initiative Charis is on there Pair is on there monk is on there Corpus is on there I just need Phineas on there Charis you will be on Glimmer To represent your Your dragon Okay perfect

[Speaker 6]
Two seats and everything

[Speaker 1]
Indeed I'm going to move you over here Corpus you will Also be over this side And Lirian You will be over on that side

[Speaker 5]
I can no longer be carried by my Magic items

[Speaker 1]
That's fine drop a White dragon for yourself down there

[Speaker 4]
We're all going to feel Naked after this

[Speaker 1]
Indeed

[Speaker 4]
Naked with our butts Flapping in the wind

[Speaker 1]
Oh no In the combat Monk your turn Goes and passes you have access to Reaction again Corpus same for you pair same for you Mimosa same for you Growl favored consort I'm just going to update The amethyst dragon to go on his turn

[Speaker 9]
After I complete theirs

[Speaker 2]
Hmm It's all fucked There we go

[Speaker 1]
Shit Okay no you're right Back to the beginning Monk You're all flying You're all flying with white dragons So drop a You should see owned In the actors tab White dragons So you'll be able to drop those down If you want to just move yourself up To go attack him That's also fine You drop the token down after I don't know if he's going to be in your Character folder

[Speaker 3]
It's in the monsters folder

[Speaker 4]
Oh Okay

[Speaker 1]
Do your thing Oh shit you got a critical I didn't even notice that Okay Corpus

[Speaker 5]
Corpus has never been a dragon before

[Speaker 1]
Just kind of like erupts Beneath you

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying to picture in my head How punching a dragon would look While I'm on a dragon

[Speaker 3]
You do like a cool side Drift And you just use the force of that To punch in the face

[Speaker 1]
Imagine punching a horse while you're riding

[Speaker 5]
I can't imagine it I have short arms

[Speaker 1]
You gotta Think about the physics of it later There's a lot of fun shit you can do On a saddle Not that I consider punching horses fun shit That's not what I mean There's fun ways to Ride Quite inappropriately on a saddle You'd be leaning The wrong way You'd be naked You'd be standing on the saddle You would not be on the saddle You'd be like hanging onto the fucking horse's neck And like swing around There's a lot of funny shit you could do Do you have any idea How strong their necks are man They are fine with it You did not even register That is a half ton animal That will kick your head off You're gonna dodge this bonus action That's fine Anything else on your turn No that's my turn Alrighty I'm gonna have this thing Do a legendary action It's a legendary action thing False ionics explosive crystal I forgot about that Maybe Sure I need you guys to Yeah there you go And have your dragons make it too

[Speaker 6]
You too?

[Speaker 1]
Because your dragons fall prone And you also fall prone Oh just the ones in the circle Yeah monk and corpus

[Speaker 5]
Oh Shit but wait

[Speaker 6]
So I'm just using my

[Speaker 1]
No you're not doing anything Just corpus and monk

[Speaker 5]
I'm fine But our dragons aren't bro

[Speaker 1]
I mean your dragons fall like 10 feet Everybody's on a dragon

[Speaker 5]
No no that's monk Oh

[Speaker 3]
Flavor Extra toasty cheez-its

[Speaker 1]
Voice chat what the fuck

[Speaker 3]
Akira sliding on a horse

[Speaker 1]

Alright um What am I doing I am attacking I am destroying rip tear Oh that's a bonus action I'm gonna bonus action a Spiritual weapon Oh that's the edit button Oh Dang it Hang on that's not what I'm doing Wait Did it give me the option Oh okay there we go I want to cast it at a higher level Oh no it doesn't have a thing anymore Oh there it goes 60 feet Oh it's within Cool awesome

[Speaker 1]
Technically you can cast it up to 80 feet away you can move it up to 20 feet on your turn

[Speaker 3]
Yeah and then does it attack When it appears

[Speaker 2]
Yep

[Speaker 1]
Uh what are you targeting

[Speaker 3]
The dragon

[Speaker 1]
That hits Jesus Ouch

[Speaker 3]
Antlers Cool

[Speaker 1]
Anything with your action

[Speaker 3]
He'll catch it

[Speaker 1]
Ow dude

[Speaker 9]
Nothing

[Speaker 1]
Alright anything else on your turn

[Speaker 3]
I think that is everything

[Speaker 1]
Alright That brings us to Mimosa while you're going I'm gonna have this guy attack

[Speaker 5]
Don't kick me That's mean

[Speaker 1]
Like I keep Misunderstanding Oh actually I'm not gonna attack I'm just gonna cast blink Which only takes effect At the start of it's next turn It's Ow Actually you know what the drow favored consort is going to Redirect that to him Oops It takes a 37 Alright What do you got next

[Speaker 4]
Um That's it I used

[Speaker 1]
You still have your bonus action though

[Speaker 4]
Oh duh I forgot about that For some reason I thought I did use it

[Speaker 1]
Fuck yeah I'm gonna I don't know if you guys remember Rolando He was the guy who played with us before WF Um Yeah Apparently he just left a bunch of servers randomly Um but I just invited him to the PF2 campaign and he's excited about it

[Speaker 9]
Yay

[Speaker 1]
This is awesome This is Rolando He was in actually the server that In the session that WF was in

[Speaker 7]
Oh he was the first guy Yeah

[Speaker 3]
I remember I at least talked with him I mean

[Speaker 1]
He was a chogat Like shy but like

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I actually think I talked with him about Pathfinder specifically

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to apply this Alright Drow favored consort has eaten a bunch of attacks He's going to make A bunch of arcane eruption attacks Ah no I just

[Speaker 9]
Fucking ah

[Speaker 1]
Ah

[Speaker 3]
That's why I always Put it up

[Speaker 1]
Yeah

[Speaker 9]
Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Cause it won't let you go back Until you finish loading

[Speaker 1]
Okay we're good now Fine

[Speaker 3]
You should probably put the arrow to make those go away

[Speaker 1]
It's Oh you're right Definitely forgot about that thank you Gonna make some arcane eruption attacks The three of you Look at those all hit Ah and All three of you have an AC of 19 Is that accurate?

That is accurate Pretty funny Well I got 10 above And 10 above is a critical hit in Pathfinder 2nd edition Wow Oh Oh my god So I'm doing all the evading That is my That is my bullshit for This evening This is my revenge for paraleveling Up to level 20 tonight Oh shit How was that?

[Speaker 7]
I don't know how much XP you think that you guys have But it's gonna be enough Anyway That's his turn Lirian while they're dealing with the consequences Yeah I'm gonna start blade singing Cast Oh Dragons have Here's a question Interaction question Does blindsight make the cloak of displacement fail? Because it mentions an illusion But Most effects that create illusions Specifically say this doesn't work If they have blindsight or tremorsight But cloak of displacement Does not have that So there's a question Oh shit I was muted sorry I have no idea why Can you Can you hear me now? Yes

[Speaker 1]
It wouldn't work against the amethyst dragon It would work against drowfaber consort Drowfaber consort is going to Redirect the attack to him anyways I see You're making an attack I would just make it with advantage

[Speaker 7]
Can I I'm gonna use my staff of command Then And I'm gonna use All ten charges to Dominate monster

[Speaker 6]
Drowfaber consort

[Speaker 1]
He's the favorite Walking dildo of a drow matriarch

[Speaker 6]
Oh okay that makes sense My brain is mushed

[Speaker 1]
That was hers that's why she's his favorite

[Speaker 7]
So This expends the last charge So I have to roll a d20

[Speaker 1]
That delivery too

[Speaker 7]
I didn't get a one so it doesn't explode

[Speaker 1]
Dominate monsters Ten charges alright who are you guessing it on

[Speaker 7]
The amethyst dragon

[Speaker 1]
I gotta make a save Wisdom save

[Speaker 7]
My save is a 19

[Speaker 1]
Your save is a 19 okay I failed

[Speaker 7]
Okay I'm gonna tell it to Eat The consort

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
It can certainly do that On it's turn Which is next How does singularity breath work I'm just gonna place this to see if it Does anything interesting Would this work It does something like 46 damage If it just does claw claw fight I'm going to I'm more likely to kill it Oh if it just Straight up does claw claw fight It's actually more likely to kill the drowfaber consort Alright Anytime it takes damage

[Speaker 7]
It gets a save against Against My control I do have a way to kill it Without it taking damage Which is to have it drown itself in the pool

[Speaker 1]
That's clever And then it'll use one of it's legendary Reactions to use an Explosive crystal on the Explosive crystal Actually I can just do another claw attack It's more likely to hit At the end I'll do another claw attack Um Oh hey that's above It's um A few of those were above It's uh Actually I think all but one of those Were ten above I'm going to roll the damage again Twice more In the meantime who goes up next

[Speaker 9]
Charis

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead Yeah He's got a fuck ton of hit points Right now the amethyst dragon is dominated And the drowfaber consort is Being targeted by his own dragon

[Speaker 6]
Okay um So like After it's been eaten I can

[Speaker 1]
You can do whatever you want

[Speaker 6]
Hold on has it been eaten yet

[Speaker 1]
No he's in the process of trying to eat him Oh

[Speaker 6]
If I shoot him will that stop the process

[Speaker 1]
If you shoot the Dragon that would stop it but if you shoot The drowfaber consort no It's the end of the round The dominate continues

[Speaker 3]
If I'm killing the drow

[Speaker 1]
If you If you shoot the drow You're not going to be harming him In fact he'll probably be sustained

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
Uh fourteen Fourteen just misses Already

[Speaker 7]
Oh Wow

[Speaker 1]
He will attempt to flee and then get Bitten by the adult amethyst dragon Obviously Over your fire That's over ten Wait no that's not ten above A normal bite Which he's almost dead Alright and then if there's anything else You want to do on your turn you're free to do so At the start of the next round it will be monk

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
Amethyst dragon is still Whatchamacallit still dominated right now Are you trying to kill it or

[Speaker 4]
Oh shit

[Speaker 1]
Drow guy has alright let me apply The most recent rolls cause that guy Does not have a lot of hit points left Yes it was Ten over ten So you could actually kill him with the first attack Well amethyst dragon At this point is nominated Phineas could Return him to the memory at that point Or just choose to end it

[Speaker 7]
They're trying to reset it Turn it off and turn it on again

[Speaker 1]
But of course

[Speaker 4]
Phineas is dominated

[Speaker 1]
Like you won So the memory is going to say Oh it won

[Speaker 2]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
This is very exciting This is a very exciting match But it's a lot of fire

[Speaker 9]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
I think Para I think you're the only person here Who was there For the first dreaming artifact That we recovered

[Speaker 3]
Yeah it was the cloak of gloaming if I remember correctly

[Speaker 1]
It was indeed the cloak of gloaming

[Speaker 3]
It wasn't at Saliah's fire though It was at the elf place

[Speaker 1]
You rescued the princess And they were really pissed off Cause they were like oh shit now we gotta give them whatever they want

[Speaker 3]
Yeah cause I remember doing like Oh what was it I don't think it was a research I think it was just a meditation or something It was the one that gives me like a few true and a few fake

[Speaker 1]
Oh that's research

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah it would have been research

[Speaker 1]
Yeah my version of um

[Speaker 3]
But I was so sure it was a wrong thing Didn't act on it

[Speaker 1]
Which is really funny But I think one of them actually Somebody in the elf place mentioned it Don't tell them Don't tell them about the The rife of ruby or the The royal wish that's what it was called Alright we're gonna take a quick 10 minute break

[Speaker 3]
Well the hard part is Is I need James to give me the gods Because as a cleric The gods actually matter

[Speaker 4]
Yeah that's true

[Speaker 3]
I can't build her Without a god

[Speaker 5]
Yeah Pathfinder takes your religion Really seriously

[Speaker 1]
Is there Tell me about the gods in Pathfinder What do you think would be closest to White Flagger The like domains Tell me about them Cause I still got my headphones in

[Speaker 3]
Yeah Opsu is the good dragon god So I imagine that they would probably be a pretty good like Bet There's like an entire Let's see Opsu Where are you Opsu Am I gonna die Yeah Opsu the Waybringer The evil counterpart is Dahak But obviously Hera's not evil so

[Speaker 5]
Are you sure about that

[Speaker 4]
Yes Just look at that cute face You think that's evil

[Speaker 3]
One of the domains that works Probably pretty well for Twi'Flanger would be Wyrmkin Which is just the power of Dragons Oh hey there's a lot of Deities that use this Are these all just dragons Are there more than one dragon Okay well that's A demon lord

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna be so excited when she gets into a bit of a scare Also

[Speaker 3]
Wow there's more dragon gods Than I thought Most of these are just Serpentines That is an interesting edict in Arithema There's one called Sobek The dues is to Take what you want, indulge in your base Desires, feast on luxurious Food, and also kill Demons and evil creatures

[Speaker 9]
The don'ts

[Speaker 3]
The don'ts are to Cower from fights, despoil the land And kill the innocent

[Speaker 6]
You know what, perfect

[Speaker 3]
Like wow a god of Indulgence that doesn't like Go into the evil territory That's fascinating

[Speaker 5]
It's actually a neutral god I think What's his face I think his name is Korag Like the god of

[Speaker 3]
God of Gwath

[Speaker 5]
Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Korag the Forgefather

[Speaker 5]
Yes

[Speaker 3]
He's not really about Indulgence though Or were you just saying you like him

[Speaker 5]
I was just saying I like him Especially like his cleric domains Are pretty nice I think he has The efficiency And like protection domain

[Speaker 3]
Yeah he's got the protection domain He also has the creation, earth And family domain

[Speaker 5]
Wow D&D but religion is actually Extremely important to your character

[Speaker 3]
And I like the fact that like Each god also has multiple domains To choose from You know so it's like Yeah if I went with Something like Apsu Pera would probably have either protection Or travel I feel like As opposed to Wyrmkin

[Speaker 5]
I want you to guess what domain I'd use I know there's a lot but I'm sure you can take a bit of a gander

[Speaker 4]
Con-ly

[Speaker 3]
Delirium

[Speaker 5]
Community I'm not sure what the community domain is Like in the Pathfinder TE But a 1e, oh my god It is busted

[Speaker 3]
Community does not exist

[Speaker 5]
Wow

[Speaker 3]
Instead you have cities I don't know if that's necessarily the same Family would probably be another Really similar one But that's just soothing words And a spell called unity Yeah there's nothing else really similar To community in there

[Speaker 5]
Can you filter by like Abilities? What do you mean?

Like the abilities And the domains Can you filter out of whatever you're

[Speaker 3]
So the domains In 2e Pretty much just give you spells Oh So you would just get like A domain spell and then if you took the feat You'd get an advanced domain spell

[Speaker 5]
Okay Because in 1e it's like each domain Has it's own ability Like it's own certain effect

[Speaker 3]
Yeah in this one it's A little bit lighter But I think these Well the spells are the only Like taking the domain is the only way You get these specific spells So there's that Ah yes, parch My favorite of the spells I think it's so funny

[Speaker 5]
It's a spell that makes you thirsty That is an amazing spell

[Speaker 3]
Cities gives you the ability To blend into a crowd And it also lets you Roll really good on some Recall knowledge checks for city stuff

[Speaker 6]
I'm so tired

[Speaker 5]
You've been locked in all night And you still have to be locked in The game doesn't let you go You're kidnapped

[Speaker 3]
There's also the pantheons The pantheons are also cool Because it's a set of gods

[Speaker 4]
A place to one by one That's disgusting

[Speaker 3]
Probably pretty meditative though Nice

[Speaker 6]
What are we talking about?

[Speaker 3]
I put it in voiceover flow It's a plastic model of a sesame ball And you have to place each individual sesame

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god

[Speaker 3]
You have to break it off the plastic frame And then place it

[Speaker 7]
That's hell

[Speaker 4]
I suppose some people would find it Meditative

[Speaker 6]
I first thought it looked like a math problem

[Speaker 1]
Alright so what we're going to do is We're going to end for tonight We're going to finish up the pools Go ahead and add all of your stuff to Celial Spire before we end But you folks will each receive We're going to round it up You guys can add 20,000 XP Sorry No no no 20,000 XP per person

[Speaker 5]
Does anything like carry over Into the I guess rerun?

[Speaker 1]
Things can and will But they can't from the very beginning Because it's just going to fuck everything up

[Speaker 5]
Okay Because I was about to be like Why would we need this XP Among other things

[Speaker 1]
I think Para's going to have I think it's going to be fun when Para's level 20 next session

[Speaker 5]
Speaking of Para

[Speaker 1]
Para's only going to be like 10k away And that will very quickly get fixed At the beginning of next session

[Speaker 3]
So I'm 13k away Yep

[Speaker 1]
So Para contributed The Cloak of Gloaming Zealot's Recompense was contributed by Monk meaning that there is There's Mimosa And Frogatha

[Speaker 2]
And

[Speaker 1]
You have Mimosa, Karas, and Lirion And Corpus Oh Oh There you go So Corpus, Lirion, and Karas needs to be a tribute item So now you respire

[Speaker 5]
I'm out of items to contribute

[Speaker 6]
Actually I have one more I can just use my drum after that

[Speaker 5]
Unless you count this Transformation scroll But I literally threw everything I had Staff of Striking My Dragonhide Belt My Pyrrhic Wound Closure Actually, wait Did I throw away my original Fire Resistance No I did not, okay

[Speaker 1]
If you end up running out you can contribute a Memory of you Which will be a secret that you will Basically forget Until Yeah Now

[Speaker 9]
Go ahead

[Speaker 1]
You do it once as far as secrets go It'll be like something that you Something that That you knew about the game Meta knowledge that your characters Will not have access to until it's Recovered But will confer another benefit upon recovering it

[Speaker 4]
I don't want him dead I didn't realize Can I I have no suffocator I'm toasting

[Speaker 1]
That means you're gonna have to find him again

[Speaker 9]
No she doesn't

[Speaker 1]
Also that wasn't in the Campaign

[Speaker 4]
Well I need Man if she could lose him forever

[Speaker 5]
Hey James I have a wonderful idea

[Speaker 2]
Mhm

[Speaker 5]
A horse that is a bard

[Speaker 9]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
Tell me about this later I'm gonna be on your bed soon Sorry Tyrant devil Rift her

[Speaker 6]
Now I just have my drum I don't have any items That I'm attuned to

[Speaker 5]
Oh wow

[Speaker 1]
Interesting

[Speaker 6]
Nice

[Speaker 1]
Lirian Did you contribute something

[Speaker 7]
Yeah look at this placement

[Speaker 1]
Ah perfect Alright so I'm very excited to do Celial Spire With you guys That'll be One that'll be so much more cool in BF2 I think But more importantly I think you guys will have Like a lot of fun A lot of shit to do over there There's a place Beneath that spire that nobody Ever went to Which I was very sad about Like fuck there was Drow New Orleans And nobody went down there

[Speaker 5]
I can't imagine That you actually being sad Me?

[Speaker 6]
He is indeed a human

[Speaker 1]
Sesame ball I am a human being after all Alright folks That's terrible Okay Well thank you for We got started way later than I was expecting But that was actually a shit ton of fun

[Speaker 3]
Yeah what are we doing The part 2 on this one

[Speaker 1]
Part 2 I believe is going to be on the 22nd Is that when you were available next Well I know you were available on the 19th I just didn't know if I had something Available for the 19th

[Speaker 3]
19th, 22nd, and 26th Are my next We

[Speaker 1]
Yeah the 19th is a Tuesday and Tuesday nights I am working But if we do the 22nd I will not be working

[Speaker 6]
So the people that didn't get to do the session Like Hart What do they do about the dropping things in

[Speaker 9]
They can

[Speaker 1]
If Hart would like to choose things to make up For uh Hart would like to choose a memory Actually tag Hart And Give Hart the rundown Of what these are And tell Hart, Hart can clear one of these By contributing a memory Like picking a place on the campaign map And a conflict that went on To Contribute magic items That will clear them out Instead of those items being found Somewhere Where they normally, where they were like During the campaign It will be, the enemy that you pick Will have access to them, but you will also Know where those items are Or the place of conflict That you pick will have access to them But you'll know where those items are That's the trade off But I think everybody has a chance

[Speaker 6]
Well I'm going to go to bed

[Speaker 1]
I'm also going to get ready to go to bed Anybody have questions for me While I'm up and about walking around

[Speaker 3]
None that you'd be able to answer right now

[Speaker 5]
You can already hear the barrage Of questions when you switch Like I can just hear it in my head

[Speaker 4]
I do better with Pathfinder So if you'd like to ask me About me, about you

[Speaker 5]
Well All my Pathfinder experience has been with First Edition You know, the buff stacking Minmax and Nightmare

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the nice thing about Pathfinder 2 is it's a lot more balanced Um I apparently also have realized That I have a freakish Knowledge about it, apparently Um I always am like, oh I don't know that much And then I'm able to pick out like A bunch of random information Just out of a hat And it's like, oh I guess I do know a lot about

[Speaker 5]
Hold on

[Speaker 3]
It's just easier to understand It just makes More sense I'm also gonna build Kara to be a turbo healer Again

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, um Healers in Pathfinder Are actually Quite, quite powerful

[Speaker 3]
Well In 2E there's not Quite as many of the same Like there's hardly any resurrection magic In 2E

[Speaker 5]
But you still have like the Channel positive energy Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Uh For healing

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, channel positive energy basically

[Speaker 3]
Well yeah, there's like healing and stuff Um, but Like Forget everything you know from 1E Cause like, a lot of it's gonna be different Um, cause I don't even know What that is referring to The closest I could think is Maybe like the um Healing font

[Speaker 5]
Um, okay so Think of channel positive energy like A uh, you know the In 5E you have life cleric So what's their class feature Um, the big like circle AoE heal

[Speaker 3]
Mm Well that's just a heal spell

[Speaker 5]
Uh, no it's their uh Like their ability Not the spells

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just forget everything in 1E Um, there's nothing like that In 2E

[Speaker 5]
Okay

[Speaker 3]
Uh, it would just be the heal spell

[Speaker 5]
I'm cooked Is what you're telling me

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just assume everything's gonna be different And if it's the same then okay cool You get one thing that's the same But for the most part Um, it is going to just be

[Speaker 5]
Uh, pretty different Oh brother This guy stinks You mean I can't put a ring on my dog This is heresy

[Speaker 3]
Also swapping hat Ancestry Know her heritage

[Speaker 5]
My god

[Speaker 9]
I'm not gonna say anything

[Speaker 3]
Oh I'm not in my Foundry right now

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay I found a looking glass

[Speaker 3]
I was earlier and I was Building her Um And In the switchover I'm Putting her into the aasimar Because I can be a kobold aasimar Nephilim Whatever you want to call it And then I have to wait for level 3 To take my Thug and adopted ancestry feed Which I think is silly

[Speaker 7]
I should probably go to sleep

[Speaker 9]
Alright

[Speaker 5]
You have a good one man Night

[Speaker 1]
Gods will be an interesting discussion Uh, I think that I've seen work And it's just a lot of it's just gonna be Finding the closest god Available and I could just turn them into I could just change their name Which one's worse

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the sticky part Is gonna come when um You're almost gonna have to do that With all the gods Um And like have a little database Cause Or have a chart of like which one's the closest To select Cause there's like There's like the whole little Sheet from each of the gods And I don't mind you guys choosing

[Speaker 1]
Normal gods that already exist On your second edition as well If you want to choose Phrasma over like Phrasma's basically I should reverse this The action coil is basically Phrasma As far as Pathfinder's second edition is concerned But if you want to go with Phrasma Anyways In fact I literally had a Koi as a cleric of Phrasma

[Speaker 3]
Or barbarian of Phrasma

[Speaker 1]
I guess really A little bit of both

[Speaker 3]
Cause I remember Koi had come in and built a Pathfinder character first

[Speaker 1]
Yeah I felt really bad about that But that also tempted me Towards it a little bit I was like Huh What if I didn't If I wasn't obligated to like put this module out What would I be doing here Oh yeah I wouldn't be I wouldn't still be running 5e if I didn't have The module hanging over my head Or just whatever I can Put out at the end of the year And then And then washing my hands of it And I'll probably still like add Details to it But only for like the details will be like Mostly Pathfinder second edition things And the things I can put out in 5e as well It is what it is Wattsy put out the OGL nonsense And I'm like alright I don't

[Speaker 3]
And then they did all of their Weird like Remastering but like everything's completely Different

[Speaker 1]
I feel like

[Speaker 9]
The game this was made for doesn't exist anymore

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I feel like 5e should have been separate From whatever they're doing now But they're taking their foundry module And completely like Obliterating it in favor of that one Which feels like a weird decision Because it's like If it's that different why not make them Two separate systems

[Speaker 1]
Oh you mean the fact that They're force updating the

[Speaker 3]
The foundry module

[Speaker 1]
To remove legacy content

[Speaker 3]
Yeah like it's not like they're compatible Like you can't really do Both Because they've changed so much It's not like the Pathfinder remaster Where like it's pretty much backwards Compatible And was just like a renaming of a bunch of stuff

[Speaker 1]
Like the classes are mostly There and like you could import The bastions but like You can't You can't take the stuff That would like be used beforehand And kind of like I don't know you can't rebuild Your 5e character in the 2024 PHB You can have them side by side Have them relatively Competent side one another But And you could have the PHB You have the 2014 ones Do stuff similar to that Use the same skill checks And stuff like that For the 2024 And there's going to be some differences Not everything's going to be equal They're going to be kind of okay next to each other But I don't know once you start getting Into the bastions and other stuff it's like Okay you're kind of turning this Into a different system And if you just delete the legacy stuff Like I can't It doesn't matter if there's stuff I want to play in 2024 You just deleted The legacy stuff that I wanted to play it with So now I have I'm kind of forced to Either not update or switch To a different system at that point They're telling you to switch To a different system

[Speaker 2]
That's insane

[Speaker 2]
And if he dies, I'd like to chop off his head.

[Speaker 1]
He dies. He had nine hit points left after a pair of last hits.

[Speaker 6]
All right, he is- Finally.

[Speaker 2]
And Bruce will start making his way this way.

[Speaker 1]
All right, at this point the hook bar is going to run off the map. It's going to run towards everything- Hey, get back here, you coward! I'll be the end of combat on round seven.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I- I feel like, uh, I need to hand you this.

[Speaker 3]
But it's- it's not yours. But, uh, first comes to worst, so I'd rather you, uh, have something to defend yourself.

[Speaker 2]
I can't hear you. One second.

[Speaker 7]
No, I'm talking to the higher than you explain. What do I- Yeah, I'm giving him the liver action rifle.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be handy. When he levels up, by the way, you'll be able to give him, uh, sharp sugar, if you so desire. God, man, you gotta- you gotta pump up that, uh- you gotta pump up that hit bonus.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Plus six to hit a level eight character is rough.

[Speaker 10]
I- I don't know why I chose, uh, two feats instead of an ASI.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, do we want to take six- uh, ten minutes?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, should- I think I should probably- we should probably heal a little bit.

[Speaker 5]
Well, if we take ten minutes, I have a healing spell.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, let's heal up a little.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, uh- I'm going to put some coffee on the table while you guys, uh- hang out. You're free to take a 10-15 minute break, if you'd like.

[Speaker 4]
All righty. Oh, geez. Wow.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, ten minutes is a short rest, too, isn't it? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, no, no. Ten, uh, an hour for a short rest. I mean, I don't know the- the route that James goes by.

Our- our- yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Well, when he gets back, we can ask, because, um, that does- Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Also, where is the Hireling, uh, document?

[Speaker 7]
Is it the downtime now?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I'm at half on Bruce and three-fourths on Majako.

[Speaker 4]
How are you guys? I'm at full.

[Speaker 5]
Para? I'm at half.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, Majako's gotta consider how he's doing up these. He's going to put ten lay on hands into all three of Majako, Para, and Bruce.

[Speaker 5]
Um, actually, I think I might act- Um, let me double check that. Uh, how close are you to, uh, being all full?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, let me bring up Shitsugin.

[Speaker 5]
What is your Hireling at, um, Mark?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I mean, with the Prayer of Healing, should be full. Uh, Majako's 16 from full. Bruce is at 40 from full.

[Speaker 5]
So I have my Channel Divinity Preserve Life, which gives me 55 hit points to a lot. Um, after healing myself to full, that leaves 19 left over. Um, do you want me to do that, or do you want to do your thing?

Which do you think would be more effective?

[Speaker 2]
I already did the ten to each, but if you could do that on top, it'd be appreciated.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, what do you mean, ten to each? Ten of my lay on hands points. Oh, it's not in the chat.

Um, so is that- is the health you told me after the lay on hands?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. And that was just to your two guys, right? Oh yeah, I also sent ten your way if you needed it.

Okay, so that would take the leftovers up to 29. Um, so do you want that 29 to go to the guy who's, uh, more injured?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 4]
So 29 to you, which would bring you up to 80 out of 101. That is actually 31.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. There you go, that way you can use it up for healing.

[Speaker 4]
So that would max me out, I believe. It would. How do I- actually, how do I know a hireling's HP?

Um, do you have a sheet for him? I do, but it doesn't have a lot.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it should at least have the head points.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I mean, I- I'm the one that filled it out, so- and I didn't know what to put in it, so I didn't.

[Speaker 5]
I also had a potion of greater healing this whole time. I'm silly. Save it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just save that one. We might need it further in. Well, that was an interesting fight.

[Speaker 5]
I think what we need to do is get magic items that allow people to see in some magical darkness.

[Speaker 4]
Would be nice!

[Speaker 5]
Because I have darkness, and I keep not sending it out because I don't want to limit you guys on being able to attack things, but I can send people into hell.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, darkness doesn't matter if the character's got darkvision or not. You need devil sight to see through it.

[Speaker 5]
There are some items that give you the ability to see through magical darkness, like Para has an item that lets her see through magical darkness, which is also what gives her darkness and lets her send things to Eevee Deevee.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the- isn't the Wings of the Bad or something like that?

[Speaker 5]
No, it's the Cloak of Gloaming, which is a fey object, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Look back. How's everything going? Yeah, we're chilling.

[Speaker 3]
How do I know my hireling's HP? Because I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, okay. So, the thing- the system I was initially playing around with was a threshold system where you wouldn't worry about his HP, but if he took over a certain amount of damage, he would cook it down.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Or he would- he would, like, lose a level of hit points. That works.

[Speaker 1]
That would be- let's see here. Level one- let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
Is level times five. Oh wait, his level's three. Why did I say his level's one?

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Now that a bunch of my other projects are- are closing up, I'll be able to put that hireling's stock out.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, should we be having that fire go out, or- Eh. What fire? What fire?

The Flamestrike. Oh, it doesn't set things on fire. Oh.

All right, so what would the party like to be?

[Speaker 2]
Venture forward into the thing, I suppose. We spent so much effort clearing the place. Let's continue on.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, you following along.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, give me one second.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, what's over there?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you come across a- what? Pro- oh, look. You gotta- you gotta give me a chance to answer first.

Uh, these question marks are not here for a reason. So, you see a rack of weapons.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I would inform the party that there's something over here.

[Speaker 1]
So, you see a dagger that looks like a piece of jagged stone, whose blade is scribed with a maze-like pattern with no beginning or end.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm, that sounds oddly symbolic to Majako. Would Majako have any knowledge of a religion that uses such- I don't think so.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, okay. Anything else there?

[Speaker 1]
The dagger? No. Um, but the blade of- blade of broken mirrors?

Now visible.

[Speaker 3]
The blade of broken mirrors? That sounds relevant.

[Speaker 1]
What would you folks like to do next?

[Speaker 3]
It's not really- Wait, wait a- wait a second, wait a second. I gotta look at something. Uh, I'm gonna look through this, uh, this window here.

And uh, did this creature leave an imprint like the killer that we've seen?

[Speaker 1]
Which window?

[Speaker 3]
The one he went through, this one.

[Speaker 1]
Yes he did.

[Speaker 3]
Aahhh. I'll- I'll just kick his head. And I'll go, it was a creature like that- It was flying like a soccer ball.

I uh that's that could be a sport uh anyways uh it was either him or one of whatever that is

[Speaker 2]
that uh did the killings probably right okay let me take a look at him and see if

[Speaker 5]
i can think of what he is para you wish um yes but really quickly james how long is a short rest whatever okay okay

[Speaker 2]
i converse with para and we together would like to put our heads together to try and figure out

[Speaker 5]
what this thing is exactly did we know what they were last time we fought these guys

[Speaker 1]
i don't i don't think anybody attempted it last time i think someone tried and then failed

[Speaker 5]
if i remember correctly because i remember someone making a roll to try and maybe that was the spider guys that i'm thinking of the spider guys um so what would this be

[Speaker 2]
artana or religion uh i'll aid her in her religion role aid does advantage right yes wait

[Speaker 5]
aid sorry what um he's aiding me in a religion role to identify them yes okay all right so this

[Speaker 1]
is known as a star spawn it comes usually as star spawns usually come as the result of some elder evil cult or something that worships apparitions or sometimes called nightmares that are brought into the world usually by horrific or profane acts or rituals magic or rituals that disrupt the natural order of the world and sort of crack open reality it can also be summoned by psionics being used and going terribly wrong the process typically known as fracturing oh i wonder if this has to do with those dreams this particular one you do notice a bit of crystal growing out of its chest

[Speaker 2]
i think we need to grab that body in general and bring it with us what do you think the the wizard can do something about it no but it's also got one of those crystal formations in its chest

[Speaker 3]
yeah that's seen these before yes the killings they had the crystals on them jetting out probably killed with uh the blade that we just took we didn't know it was a knife stab so uh james in the meantime can i look around and try to figure out why the creature was here

[Speaker 1]
why it was here yeah sorry guys okay so you start going through it's as you start going like over this creature and investigating it a little bit more if you find a note inside its pocket okay unfolding it you see it says no need to burn the bodies anymore the killing should be over well played if you found this okay

[Speaker 2]
well that both worries me and relieves me

[Speaker 3]
could the angel have been the auroras so you guess i don't know uh just postulating but uh the the wizard guy from the letters that we got uh from the others he seemed to like be worried about the auroras being so many in the region right so like it could be that the objective of the killings was the auroras i don't know why but you know that is speculation at this

[Speaker 2]
point but what we do know is they claim the killings are going to stop but why they're stopping is what concerns me somewhat did they already achieve what they desired with them or or we know that uh sir go ahead para there's more place maybe there's more clues here true yes yes you're right that's interesting that is interesting let's

[Speaker 3]
avoid going in there for a little bit i'm gonna like taste the air there's a taste of feywild

[Speaker 6]
no uh not here

[Speaker 12]
oh that's outside

[Speaker 1]
hello everybody stop moving oh no magic mirror on the wall all right i think the first two were and uh bruce bruce gets to make it safe first okay and wait they were both around there and there so pc 15 uh what save prisma and now let's see how it ships okay uh and then i think um let's see here so para and paraguassan and jaeger hadn't quite made it up yet um so mizako you feel something pull at you and you see bruce gets sucked into the mirror what do you say in the couple uh bruce all right there i need you to make me christmas save get a plus five um we shot those uh yeah plus five thousand or so you're safe i think we need to examine

[Speaker 2]
this mirror a little better and see if we can get our barbarian friend out so when you spoke sorry let's see here oh never mind go ahead sorry what's happening that there's some sort of mirror that caused bruce to disappear oh what the fuck i'd like to know where or what happened to him so i'd like to let's see do i have detect magic on wait uh james you were gonna say something

[Speaker 1]
no no i reread the uh i reread the stat block address

[Speaker 2]
i'd like to detect magic on that mirror it's definitely magical what type magic with mirror

[Speaker 1]
light trap conjuration maybe i'm inclined to agree i think conjuration is probably is maybe maybe yeah because it's a kind of banishment so or trap so maybe abjuration

[Speaker 2]
but i'll take those two conjuration and after i relay what i discovered to our cleric and see if she has any ideas how to get our friend out of there well uh before that do you

[Speaker 3]
mind uh taking the the mirror off the wall just so i don't get trapped in it um maybe like i turn it

[Speaker 2]
around i turn the wall and mirror so it faces in the corner this way leaned type deal i i think you

[Speaker 1]
just flip it i'll well i guess it sounds like you're taking it off the wall so that's fine

[Speaker 2]
yeah i'm taking it off the wall and leaning it so it has space between it and the wall

[Speaker 4]
already well so have you tried shaking uh i was hoping more no what would it be like

[Speaker 1]
identify it you would need uh in order to discover a command word you would need to identify spell

[Speaker 3]
um you know what mark is gonna go behind the mirror and start like tapping it kind of like when when a person's coughing and they tap their back so uh the cough goes out they go come on uh oh oh i know uh in the fairy tales right in the fairytales they said uh the the word uh magic mirror on the floor who's the fairest of them all

[Speaker 2]
not quite i have an idea it's probably just a joke idea but i i say magic mirror on the wall show me bruce it does show you well hold on are you turning it around i motioned the others to back up out of sight okay i just turned around i motioned you guys to go out of the view of the thing if i turn it around all right okay let's try this and i say that's what happened we'll do in doubt okay so you call to bruce bruce appears okay of the mirror hey buddy how are you doing in there

[Speaker 1]
how do we get you out of there bruce is in a like 10 foot is in a uh is in a cell

[Speaker 2]
that's like an infinite expanse of fog okay i'm hating the thought of doing this but i can't think of any way to get anything out of there other than maybe breaking the

[Speaker 1]
thing will break the spell oh man you guys are just gonna break it yeah no

[Speaker 5]
can we do any sort of like role to see maybe how this like how much we know about how this works or is that kind of just an identify spell thing so you can make you can make it our account to check

[Speaker 1]
and if you if you succeed i will let your players operate on the knowledge that's

[Speaker 2]
okay i'm going to rely on the cleric's input on this should i break it uh not just yet let's let's

[Speaker 1]
think about it a little more okay this is a long ongoing campaign one character being out of commission for a little while might be might be worth it uh if you have something else to you

[Speaker 5]
let's see here i mean if we could put this in a bag of holding that'd be great but i don't know if anyone has one no we don't i mean i guess we could leave it here and um come back for it

[Speaker 4]
you could take it bring it with us yeah is it small yeah it's small enough to uh it's

[Speaker 1]
small enough for transport yeah four foot tall mirror it's like a poster i mean that's still bigger than para yeah it's bigger than para but uh it only weighs 50 pounds and you still got at

[Speaker 4]
least one uh big strong guy yeah so i'm bringing this along with i suppose but i need to find something to cover it up with just hold it up in front of you okay i hold it i bet you okay thank you for the blanket i wrap it in the blanket and put it on my back i'm trying to roll it

[Speaker 5]
but my cat's not cooperating

[Speaker 4]
so the people have spoken we are taking it back have have i tried asking the mirror to free the if you can think of a way to i mean i'll just like uh give a little like

[Speaker 3]
room between the the mirror and the blanket just in case if this works and i will say without

[Speaker 4]
looking at it because blanket um magic mirror on the wall could you free bruce are you in his reflection right now or no no no yeah uh you can't even see him right now but also unfortunately it doesn't all right okay we'll take this with us home and see if we can have someone identify it yeah anyways it'll be strapped to my back so i'll be in behind get ahead of me i'm letting you guys lead since i got the mirror on my back unless rabbit would like to have the mirror on his back hello i mean i can't uh i show my new arms okay then you guys are leading because i don't want to have the blanket slip and try and take one of you guys fair enough there's uh something here um hello once again see in kinky form kinky form of casting uh my gun's loaded i should hell yeah you got advantage all right uh

[Speaker 7]
i mean i don't know the guy i don't know how strong he is uh let's see smooth board that's

[Speaker 4]
going to be an explosive bullet too um there attack no oh sorry i wrote normal let me delete uh advantage how all righty uh time for initiative folks oh yeah uh oh wait it is the

[Speaker 3]
the explosive so it's 10 plus i think uh dexterity only yeah 10 plus dexterity

[Speaker 7]
oh uh 13 would hit that all right then uh damage holy fuck pretty good and eight five uh oh wait this was surprise right i'm an assassin all right so assassinate comes up which what does it do you get a critical this is what happens oh my god

[Speaker 3]
uh slash r to the 12 plus 46 all right uh i think that counted as my round right

[Speaker 1]
no uh no yes all right because well is he surprised uh 5e is so stupid about this uh yeah that would have been your that would have been your turn

[Speaker 8]
all right so i'm just gonna move behind me afterwards

[Speaker 6]
all right you were up

[Speaker 2]
all right magiaco i am an arachnid puts me down over here and one two three four five and dodges

[Speaker 6]
all righty all right let's hear you suggestion on jaeger oh no

[Speaker 10]
uh

[Speaker 1]
let's see uh wisdom right yep wisdom normal i'm so close point the mirror at your friends

[Speaker 9]
how was that he said point the mirror at your friends uh which one

[Speaker 1]
uh uh oh listen if you were to leave the choice up to me that's totally fine in fact i appreciated oh moving on to an eye yeah let's see actually you know what that's she's gonna have to dash to get there so she's just gonna sit here um maybe maybe this is motion

[Speaker 4]
go cast mirror image cool cool cool i get it funny okay this is going to fire me as is and that brings us to para uh i am going to sacred flame yaster oh yester go to not

[Speaker 5]
and i think that is what i can do um on my turn wait i can move do i want to move

[Speaker 4]
and i'll move

[Speaker 1]
enough character did they do a bad thing like is he a bad guy or like this isn't so this is a

[Speaker 4]
by this creature all right just resemble just resemble somebody that she's worked with before and we've been having nightmares about this creature too right all right yes whoo run over to me jaco okay attack okay miss ease okay do it again that is that hits all right you jesus come on man all right uh he gains five hit points you take five necrotic turn experiment there and we come to the top of the round with mark all right mark will mark uh no but really uh he's gonna use steady aim to gain advantage uh take out the light revolver and uh shoot with it with uh yeah just shoot with it uh attack uh vintage there you go and damage there oh i was saving the rolls for uh for despite that that's what i'm going with there

[Speaker 1]
there you go okay so that about damage that's going to knock him uh your buddy jager over here walks over picks up the mirror uh points it starts walking towards me jaco and points it towards him i need to read it again to see if it does i think let's hear me reflect trapping uh it's in the it's in the discovered items tab now so everybody

[Speaker 5]
should be able to see it again it's only when a creature sees its reflection right so if miyako

[Speaker 1]
turns around that's going to happen there's somebody else is going to affect though is this that's funny yeah she has a penalty though oh this is so good i wonder and wait wait so you want to they have uh they have magic resistance they take that out they took it out i believe no they got it eventually saving throws again try and roll again buddy oh oh it's a good for the moment all right miyako

[Speaker 2]
miyako seeing the one in front of him dead is going to go after this one and long sword attack normal with a do i have a little one in there no so i'll leave it at normal try and prone her well she might be able to beat that melana is who i'm attacking okay i got

[Speaker 1]
advantage on this one you should probably just knock him prone to start off with i have to attack first i think that's that's nonsense you could go ahead you could just do it first okay i i think i know what stage of vice you're talking about um yeah anyways i deal a total of

[Speaker 2]
14 damage to melana does she have to make any con on that suggestion uh would suggestion just end

[Speaker 5]
since he's already done the action that she suggested oh true question let me get the spell

[Speaker 1]
book again she said friends not friend so pursues the course of action the suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration so i think he's just going to keep pointing it until the uh until the concentration breaks which there were yeah she succeeds in keeping it all right melania's turn stand up that's uh yes uh all right miyako make me a concey

[Speaker 8]
oh wait no i changed my mind okay oh nice good idea sure i'll move okay

[Speaker 3]
hold on that that's not where he's going oh okay oh yeah you choose uh which person to

[Speaker 1]
choose to change right it's uh let's see maybe swaps with you but no it's not a no it's not a change place it's just uh he just moves yeah uh so let's go and and mark takes days again you two have advantage because you know the nature of the mirror all right and their charisma yep dc15 charisma all right all right oh no all right mark gets absorbed into the uh gets absorbed into the mirror

[Speaker 8]
wait less words what i'm typing it up uh this is going to be

[Speaker 1]
all right so and i'm just going to cast a hex on

[Speaker 6]
and on mr miyako and he's then going to cast eldritch blast uh what is the hex on

[Speaker 2]
okay the 17 misses six misses 24 hits uh it should be damaged but it shouldn't be plus zero

[Speaker 6]
oh six damage okay uh that should be a total of 12 all right that's her turn now you're over here okay you know it's going to fly by flies out of the enemy's reach cool cool

[Speaker 1]
cool tiny servant i'm just going to roll for a bunch of tiny servants all at once all in this that's fine para it is your turn i hate to do this but that mirror is getting smashed

[Speaker 5]
all righty i did not realize it was gonna be so low

[Speaker 1]
let's see here i think it has as vulnerability to bludgeoning damage well it is glass no but it's also magic uh magic item true not just but still it is uh yeah okay so you've dealt you've dealt six damage to all the tiny servants already went mark is currently in uh four four jaeger is going to

[Speaker 2]
jaeger's gonna move run back over uh does the familiar also have to make that save

[Speaker 1]
since he saw it on his way over it's creature there it is attributes

[Speaker 6]
um i need you to make me no save i'm not facing him oh you're right but and i and

[Speaker 2]
melana need to oh wait no this is a construct i'm the best and then i does she need to make that save yep our luck couldn't be that good as to get rid of one of them man all right miyako it's your turn miyako is going to try and get rid of this hex on him too long well first she's he's going to prone

[Speaker 4]
and i wait that's that disadvantage okay still still i'm going to attack her and now i'm going

[Speaker 2]
to do a level two smite if that hits it does i doubt she counts as any of the categories i get an extra d8 for so i don't think so now my second attack okay after she does concentration

[Speaker 1]
well roll your attack now doing so

[Speaker 2]
and damage and my level two smite on top of that because i want her out of here 3d8 these guys are having absurd luck with their concentration i like it okay

[Speaker 6]
okay happy turn she's gonna cast cautious mind whip okay go ahead and make that dc of human intelligence save okay that hurts a little 14 uh psychic damage it's her turn and i is up next and i'm just gonna go finish the class again

[Speaker 12]
mm-hmm

[Speaker 1]
okay so i'm just getting such a quick attack because i know the thing is forged 25 damage force damage yep it's her turn familiar is locked away

[Speaker 6]
tiny servant is going to attempt to attack you while para does her deal um so with spells in 5e

[Speaker 5]
i know it's real fucky um if i cast a bonus action spell do i have to do that before or

[Speaker 1]
after an action cantrip i i don't care which order you okay no the the sage advice on this was incomprehensible and probably wrong i'm gonna third level heal um

[Speaker 5]
uh and then i am going to cast um sacred flame it was oh you didn't take that much okay i thought

[Speaker 2]
you took way more damage no i took only 19 healing before so i took the other two

[Speaker 1]
no i took nothing on but you took nothing on what

[Speaker 2]
field mastery if it's a deck save no no i wasn't attacking you oh my god i accidentally clicked

[Speaker 1]
you're fine um but pair already did already did uh what you would call it six damage so i think this thing just gets destroyed okay so justin and bruce and the familiar and a few other creatures

[Speaker 5]
get released um i actually was attacking milania not the mirror okay that's my bad

[Speaker 1]
listen okay and that's uh and concentration already mark is still out of commission for the moon miyako miyako is going to try and stab it

[Speaker 2]
well first he's going to try and prone this lady who hexed him and can she be the 21 i think it's actually possible okay advantage and advantage damage that kills her okay i turn to face melanin now again oh wait i who were you attacking first

[Speaker 1]
and i the one who both of them oh all right uh well that still kills her what did you did you say her name beforehand or did i just miss it yeah the one who

[Speaker 5]
yeah he had said the hex oh the one okay not a name but in action yeah sorry

[Speaker 6]
you're fine my damage uh

[Speaker 5]
if you like double right click on the tokens it actually puts a little thing above them miyako so you can actually like show which one you're attacking first i'll right click what double right click so like click it twice there you go like that yep okay it puts a little circle above it for everyone else so that they can see who you're

[Speaker 1]
targeting yeah all right milania let's be fun might as well take herself out with a bang

[Speaker 2]
okay what's milania thinking okay let's see if i take nothing or take half i take nothing

[Speaker 8]
did i roll for uh yeah yeah go ahead and roll for your boy come on boy i don't think that's

[Speaker 1]
29 fire damage half on a success uh your guy goes unconscious the mirror is broken oh my goodness these are all going to go down well i think it might be justin and or sorry mark and bruce are released from the mirror uh as are a bunch of civilians and one

[Speaker 3]
fade okay uh so as i come out and i go when i'm down and i see the fade

[Speaker 8]
cox gun shoots wait is it a hyborio is it a hyborio or uh so but do you want to do you

[Speaker 5]
want to take that uh give him a chance first he was crapped with a bunch of people

[Speaker 3]
yeah i'll point the gun but i won't shoot and i'll say give me one reason why it won't shoot you

[Speaker 1]
fucking hunter well um i guess because you're unlikely to hit me uh this creature has a lot of feathers a lot more feathers than you've seen probably on other bay racing their form they're like frowning the like frowning their head going around the sideburns around the neck area you could see them poking out from the you see them poking out from uh does this like

[Speaker 3]
do their features match the description of uh an archway that i would know

[Speaker 1]
yep can it make me a history check all right this is the cardinal this is a fave that's associated with qualeria the songbird it's there they have a spotty relationship that's usually described as like consort or lovers or sometimes occasionally marriage uh but he's been

[Speaker 3]
missing for some time and uh which court is he associated with he's associated with the clover

[Speaker 2]
court all right i i would like to put my hands into this guy oh good idea actually i know you

[Speaker 1]
would need to if you want to bring him back up you would have to do five plus uh what's what's uh you have to pop 13 points of my level date i just took the one point off so he can wake up yeah no okay so what i meant was the hirelings work under different rules if you want him to

[Speaker 2]
wake up you have to i'm doing that while the others are talking okay yeah uh yeah after i

[Speaker 3]
like take my gun off him i'll turn to uh jaeger and do some first aid uh so use improved healing for that's good i'll be right back oh oh he got left the jekyll left oh there he's back oh

[Speaker 2]
yeah i just all of a sudden heard no sound from anybody yeah uh james law for a second or two

[Speaker 8]
that's gonna be interesting because i decided that the hypo real court is my enemy so i don't know

[Speaker 5]
how i feel about the other one well we're kind of working with them at least para has started working with some of them so she is going to probably um take an amiable stance um i also think what para is going to want to suggest is um letting her grab like an associated object from this place and maybe getting a skadoodle on um yeah let's get out of here i know there's more i'm here to explore and i'd love to do that but i am almost completely tapped

[Speaker 2]
yeah i'm trying to think how about a part of that frame of the mirror we could use that as

[Speaker 5]
an associated item um i guess yeah we could leave it here uh i would have to see if james would allow that to count as an associated item for this area i assume if we leave it here probably well

[Speaker 2]
it's broke it's broken now so all we need is a piece of it and just leave the pieces in the corner somewhere no one's going to bug with them unless someone comes back and there were

[Speaker 5]
more things left that's kind of my concern is it's like oh there's more to look at but

[Speaker 2]
i'm out of stuff as majako except nine hands points i just like some spells stuff i'm just

[Speaker 3]
nervous about another fight i can try to sneak ahead and a scout yeah how long does it take you

[Speaker 5]
to do the portal home thingy um it is one action for me but i can also only take um eight other people with me um so i would have to but i also have a teleport so i can take them back someplace um either asheros or uh sears keep um and then come back for everybody else um because basically like i can use my one free teleport for the week uh i don't think i'll have to use it more than once uh-huh oh wait what are all these flowers on the wall of this place i assumed they were

[Speaker 2]
just like moss or like ivy or something well just yeah could we yeah i was just going to ask do we

[Speaker 4]
want it could you take some of that as the associated item those probably grow more

[Speaker 5]
um so if we took a piece of the broken mirror would that count as an associate object for this place to teleport to real thing all right i'm gonna add piece of broken mirror into inventory

[Speaker 4]
all right so uh just because uh you left in while i was doing the thing using the herbalist kit the herbalism that yeah healer's kit uh am i able to stabilize uh yeager

[Speaker 2]
i already laid on hand some one point while i was like i already explained this like three

[Speaker 1]
times right now he does not he couldn't hear you oh he does not get restored to uh consciousness

[Speaker 4]
by one hp oh is he at least stable yes okay then i'll drag him along with over to the teleport circle area yeah basically all right so um am i uh scouting ahead or are we just living

[Speaker 5]
i think we're dipping um that is up to you do you want to scout ahead um just to see or would you want to just come back later possibly i feel i feel like this place will be

[Speaker 3]
searched later so it's good to at least have a general look around i'll try to keep myself safe

[Speaker 5]
um i could also how many people are here like how many of the civilians and whatnot

[Speaker 1]
oh that's right so let's see if the thing holds well now two six civilians and then the cargo

[Speaker 5]
okay so i can teleport them all out and come back and then i'd still have the ability to um teleport us out uh so i can at least get them out of here first um if you want to scout while i do that all right i'll do that

[Speaker 3]
uh in just before i do this uh so we can get notes properly james what's the name of the

[Speaker 4]
clever court uh people sorry the of this specific guy yeah is that with the cardinal the cardinal and he's a lover too all right what did you say uh who is his uh lover his interest i'm gonna put that in the chat all right thank you all right okay and uh i'm going to scout ahead and search steps

[Speaker 1]
good all righty let's go ahead let's see uh along this wall is a bunch of notes papers and pieces from the spell book taped across the floor and wall

[Speaker 4]
all right i'll say i'll just yell back hey i found the mckeef spell book it's uh torn apart here i think you'll want it back well if you want by the way uh because it's starting

[Speaker 1]
to get a little bit starting to get a little bit late if you want we could handle the remainder of your investigation at downtime and that way i could i could basically have all the notes in

[Speaker 4]
writing for your uh your personal notes okay that's that's an option you guys like if there's

[Speaker 5]
unless you guys want to but uh i'm good to keep going my concern was just resources okay yeah like

[Speaker 1]
if there's no other encounter i can well no there are other encounters but right now you

[Speaker 4]
have a high stealth score all right uh i don't know whatever is more comfortable to you that's

[Speaker 1]
up to you man um let's see here so like i said there's a bunch of notes and stuff over here target names target lists some of the writing appears to be way more recent like a lot of the writing is just like faded like the ink has faded to gray

[Speaker 4]
i'll collect those and put them away uh where did you where did you move next

[Speaker 3]
do you have a retrace your steps uh i went uh through oh wait measuring tool went through this

[Speaker 1]
wall and then here you mean the wall all right so you were here like which way did you go here

[Speaker 3]
yeah i was here i went over here then here here okay um and then you went down this way do you want

[Speaker 1]
yeah okay all right so over here it is uh stretched up against the sort of like spread eagle against the wall it looks to be a relatively older man about 10 ish probably about 60 there's a little bit of crystal growing out of his eye and out of his chest

[Speaker 3]
and all right i will gingerly move no i'll i'll circle back and go here so what do we see here over there is another mirror it's a little different last time all right do i need to roll a save or not from your current position no all right i will uh blind fold myself and get down close to the floor and make my way to the mirror and uh just like grab it and gingerly put it away flip it and then unblind fold uh then i'll like put it on my back uh like under the the cloak good and this one i think is only about 25 pounds so

[Speaker 1]
your current severely diminished strength won't cause you too many problems yeah

[Speaker 3]
oh yeah did anyone pick up his stuff what my stuff uh i i left it with uh my harling um so here is that all right so what are you doing uh just looking through the corner to see if i see what's here see the edge of another mirror all right i'll back up uh all right all right so i go um so we found another mirror uh there's also this strung up body down there and some sort of weird big creature here as well as another mirror uh there's something else going on here but uh i don't think it's uh wise for us to stick around anyway i'll just uh i'll make a rough sketch for the place notes here oh i also found and i take the torn spell book and uh invest the target and i place it in one of your hands

[Speaker 2]
here majaka will take that this will help greatly and along with this head as we bring he pulls out the star seers head that we have on us um we should be able to be able to clear that matter up along with the tale of what's here

[Speaker 5]
should we check out that body did it look alive at all oh no very dead uh could you describe the

[Speaker 3]
body um old man around his 60s uh had crystals not only growing from the chest but also

[Speaker 2]
one of the his eyes that sounds almost it's exactly like the person who rented the room man was last to talk to the person who was killed

[Speaker 3]
so that's it that's a genuine question i i don't much differentiate among humans and for how this will you know i think

[Speaker 2]
history check we might want to grab that body as well just so we can have the or teleport from there and grab the body there so we can have the police constable person do a identity verification on it all right so shall we what's the party doing we're heading to where he found that one strung up body grabbing the body and teleporting out along with everything else we found

[Speaker 1]
are you taking this mirror over here uh this one all right yeah i grabbed the notes okay so body and uh yep and are you taking this

[Speaker 3]
no no okay i only looked uh looked around the corner he didn't go there i went back i saw the whatever was over here and i was like yeah no well you're stealthed you have a

[Speaker 1]
stealth of 27 if you wanted to nab it um i think that's okay i i'm not gonna attempt that much

[Speaker 3]
so the body's over here oh uh we gotta be quick about this

[Speaker 5]
grab the body all right para teleports everyone out um probably to oh gosh do we want to go to asheros or sierra's keep sierra's keep sierra's all right so we will go to sierra's keep the

[Speaker 1]
cardinal sneaks back into having disappeared for a hot second for shuffling something into the backpack well then let's see can we get out of here yeah let's get out of here oh i would have

[Speaker 9]
thought para would already have taken him out oh did you um but yeah previously teleported out

[Speaker 5]
um yeah when he was doing his investigation um i was gonna take the civilians all because i can only take eight people at a time so i was just gonna like deposit them either in asheros or sierra's keep depending on where they wanted to be at uh and then offer to take the cardinal to

[Speaker 1]
salil's tower okay well the cardinal's back with you guys now and uh so you guys can definitely do that okay i think that would be first destination the civilians are most interested in going to Bronloch because they're going to sierra's keep Bronloch okay that's what they're

[Speaker 5]
trying to get back to all right so that one uh could be a free teleport and then um teleport back using the mirror frame piece and then taking everybody else back to sierra's keep again

[Speaker 1]
all righty you guys make it back to sierra's keep a bunch of folks are waiting for you including wayne and white the two wardens allison the pay that you folks rescued from red not too long ago uh jesse is standing around as well kind of checking things out more or less to check on anybody who comes in on the on the teleportation circle and cyan is probably sick and you folks come in with a whole bunch of with a whole bunch of civilians a new pay and a uh and

[Speaker 2]
a body and evidence we proceed to explain what we found and the situation to the warden slash

[Speaker 1]
constables and everybody there there are no wardens but both the constables not i mean warden whatever the yeah so those two guys are like uh rangers basically they used to

[Speaker 2]
yeah there are pals okay well we might want to entertain i'm not sure what we should be doing other than i know those notes and the body need to go to the constable for ivy and going through we might want to leave the fey here to spend some time with his friends hopefully they're friends

[Speaker 1]
yeah what's the mood between them uh interesting neither of them have seen the other in ages else you've been disappeared how soon as you've been disappeared since i got back what the hell did you get so they're chatting back valeria will be happy to see you she'll probably it's been long she'll be happy have you seen her i haven't i've just gotten back out here i don't know uh where she is in fact i only only know two of us at the moment about him he's still here still uh he's still in his in his same heat but it seems like he hasn't come out of it as of late and there appears there's a new there's no queen consort there's a lady of the clover salaya he seems to be in some distress of in any case the the nesting gate is still active if you wish to find your wish to find your own plane that location i'm sure she would be close by and the colonel says where you should i'd like to meet salaya have

[Speaker 5]
i have a better person i can teleport you there but if she's in distress we might need to make

[Speaker 1]
an adventure of it i i would certainly love to be teleported there too in fact even even now

[Speaker 5]
just to just to comfort her um para can take them i think the other two have a handle on the uh taking the body

[Speaker 2]
thank you para we shall see you when you get back so para are you just dropping the two of

[Speaker 5]
them off pretty much or um she's gonna get a feel for what's going on at the tower like how urgent it is um but i think i know what i'm planning for the next uh next week so

[Speaker 1]
and that's this uh let's see you guys get to the tower iscarius is gone it's the uh hyborial port guy that was like fishing uh just fishing inside the place and salaya was there and she's she's very clearly distressed the coral spire has gotten way way way bigger and its influence has spread to most of the other spires and it's pretty much in the past about three weeks now like in virtually no time at all like this is a completely different bio see a lot of latticework you see a lot of flamingo looking birds that are composed of latticework coral uh flight they're roughly the size of moa just flying about i love these guys the area is still kind of misty but it's much more like light flurries of snow except it's it's like sea-based particles instead dense and taste of saltwater taffy is pretty much everything there's small flocks of flying jellyfish just floating by it's just a completely different place from when you guys first got here salaya comes up and she looks afraid she's she looks absolutely terrified that they when their their emotions are so exaggerated and they look like facial contortions like jim carrey on steroids whenever they're whenever they're experiencing any strong emotion and she's her face is warped into something of a caricature of terror she said thank goodness both of you were here they it's um in essence iscarius warned he would come i didn't think that he would do it so quickly and i thought that he might wait for his army but he's he's waiting he's he's waiting just past this fire waiting on the other side and um he's just been waiting he hasn't advanced or anything i don't know why he hasn't entered here but and he hasn't completed his ballot yet so i don't know what's going on but he's he's just waiting on the other side i think for me and callison and the cardinal both look at each other all right um okay and that's just he is safain's hunter safain's right-hand man if he's approached here it's because he's attempting to challenge salaya but combat okay the longer he waits the more the more of an issue we're going to have he's here to see if if we don't go out and fight him or if someone doesn't go out and fight him it's going to incentivize him to test the place probably with probably with a larger force

[Speaker 2]
how powerful is he exactly bruce will ask up and would it be one-on-one combat i don't think it would be one-on-one combat wouldn't matter

[Speaker 5]
we can gather a party and and um try and help

[Speaker 1]
if one of us one of us can go out um but i'm i'm first of all i'm in a weakened state because i have not completed my ballot i've been locked up for some time the cardinal here doesn't isn't a board council he doesn't have a ballot one of us goes out it's not likely to be good and even if we do win it means just nobody else it means that was our best if that makes sense perhaps that if perhaps that's a good thing you did send a few of your friends out to of your weaker friends out to die and once they came around here or once he attacked this fire we could be waiting for him it'd be something of a pleasant ambush but it's up to perhaps what is

[Speaker 5]
oh what do you think para um did uh did bruce have a question i was going to ask para which would you think would be wisest i'm not sacrificing people uh i will try and gather a party and we'll see what we can do did i did i push the button or did i forget

[Speaker 3]
no it's good i'm sick all right all right just so uh because i'm confused is it a ballad or a battle ballad or both so they're gonna sing to each other he has to do a ballad to get back to full power ah i see and none of the fey here have a ballot so they're not as strong as he is that what's happening the fey ballads will explain to you

[Speaker 1]
our quests or events in their lifetime that they repeat every year or that they're supposed to repeat every year and it correlates with like the strength of the season report the more folks do their to go ballots it also affects how many people they're able to like muster or marshal around them when it comes to battle so obviously the clover court has a need to worry about the changing seasons for a thousand years so they've been they've been lax in actually doing them the cardinal doesn't have a valid the lyle doesn't know what her ballot is and alice obviously has not completed his ballot because he's been chained up sometime i see the belt of finesses is a rather interesting one it's where he attacks the single handedly takes on a dragon you could you could ambush him in this process after after we chase him off the spire there is a dragon nearby that i know of oh it's not just any dragon but he has to take on the creature at now nowadays is undead or rather the bones simply reanimate and the spirit finds itself once more invested except for mountain what happened

[Speaker 2]
would it happen to have been a mercury-ish colored dragon oh it was white he was white

[Speaker 5]
i think i know where it is um the the oh god i can't say that in the overworld map i i can see it i can't say it um as a as the girth is the girth

[Speaker 1]
why is that funny

[Speaker 7]
oh yeah that is right there was a thing here a very good guess i only

[Speaker 1]
yes and no uh it is indeed over that same mountain range but not in this reality in the world

[Speaker 5]
hmm how strange i i saw a skeletal dragon over here as well

[Speaker 1]
there's a lot of necromancers up that way but yes we should we should reconvene for a plan on how to handle of how we're going to deal with finances helson says i will go out there hell i'll join you if no one else is able to step up the challenge but um i think it will have it will only give it if we go out there and if we succeed if we succeed it will only be a temporary retrieve from a current predicament he will come back with an army but surely you folks at this point to have armies of your own yes units or folks you could rely on

[Speaker 5]
and the farms a few errant mercenary company i know of someone who does

[Speaker 1]
this is good news all right in the meantime you folks also had to take some stuff over to brownlock and escort the civilians there yes they're very happy to be back because they've been trapped for about 10 years they go back they reconnect with family there's a bunch of touching reunions uh mostly touching reunions and the constable ends up finding you guys not too long after you arrived because of all the hubbub i can't believe what happened

[Speaker 2]
we relay this story of the investigation to the us falling to that convergence to what we found there and showing them what we found there and brought along with us

[Speaker 1]
good very good uh this appears to be a body hmm that's a corpse all right i know this fellow

[Speaker 2]
is he the one that was last seen talking to the one guy

[Speaker 1]
unlikely this fellow's been missing for about 10 years doomed dead uh he was he was actually a suspect in our investigation but after he disappeared we thought nothing of it and well frankly the the murder stopped as well so we figured that if he was the killer he must have

[Speaker 3]
died well you were only half right or wait actually that's the the bad way of sitting you were only half wrong so you're half right looking at the bright side any any identifying

[Speaker 2]
marks any anything in these we also we also found this creature with him as i show him the head that we brought along the sarsier head oh goodness all right i'm not

[Speaker 1]
clear with that you're gonna have to talk to an alienist i was i was hoping you'd know

[Speaker 2]
someone it's called a sarsier uh-huh but more i don't know what it is

[Speaker 3]
yeah sounds good well in any case the creature also had uh the little crystal jutting out from its chest uh oh there was also this and i take up the dagger uh this was probably the murder weapon

[Speaker 1]
um nope and the nose now this is much too thick to be the murder weapon all of our autopsies showed something about as thin as a pane of glass and occasionally we found a dagger made of glass after crime scene this is this is much too thick

[Speaker 3]
oh all right well then don't mind if i do i just stow it away um there's a

[Speaker 2]
what did you say machaco the notes and book we found in there so the book i think belonged to someone before these people took it but yeah they might be of interest to this case

[Speaker 3]
yeah i take like the collection of pages of the spellbook from the keith hand them in one pile and uh targets in another pile

[Speaker 1]
uh-huh interesting interesting there appeared to be oh well it looks like you did find our killer or at least the original one uh the more i look at these it seems like this fellow here was the original killer um was no longer was no longer able to keep doing it on account of uh he keeps talking about the thorn in his side i don't know what that is but there's other notes here from someone other than him like referring to him in the third person and you'll recall when you began this investigation they expected he was attempting to summon someone with these murders yeah like there was a mathematical formula that he was attempting to

[Speaker 2]
fulfill yeah and this final note makes me wonder if he already fulfilled it as i show him the one

[Speaker 1]
note we got in the pocket of the star seer no because he needed 52 i think he was i think he was this is just an educated guess but i think he might have been number 52 yeah that's what's worrying me yeah looks like there's another whoever it looks like somebody figured him out and killed him but like this is just more questions than we have answers to like why now why did he uh where is this person now that i don't know but at least we got answers for one of

[Speaker 2]
the things the murderers and because you know now all we need to do is discover where the other one

[Speaker 3]
is but also uh this uh situation seems to stretch way way way beyond just a bunch of murders and brownlock uh you know this aurora business we mentioned last time

[Speaker 1]
i still have no idea what it mean

[Speaker 3]
me neither but uh it has something to do with the killings and uh also the hyborio cord of fey we're not sure what connection there is if any but uh it's not good i can tell you firsthand those guys suck

[Speaker 1]
um i have to let y'all keep i i think y'all have gone above and beyond um i know i initially well i don't know how to tell well i got good news and bad news the good news is not only am i letting you keep your bounty i'm also giving you another five grand on top of the initial 2,500 we gave y'all the bad news is that and i'm also letting you collect some personal belongings the bad news is that the two folks you initially went on this investigation

[Speaker 3]
on were found dead outside brown log that explains a lot because uh they tried to kill us uh but apparently they weren't dead so it's all good

[Speaker 1]
okay i don't i don't know exactly what that means i think

[Speaker 2]
yeah no go for it i do they i think there's a higher magic that lets you make copies of people sorry say again isn't there a higher wizard spell that lets you make copies of people yes i mean yeah could the ones we have faced then one of those two of those since you found the originals possibly be here you said simulacrum i don't think so

[Speaker 1]
simulacrum doesn't really match up um maybe but they don't like the appearance of these creatures was uh black covered like composed of an inky darkness that had little notes of

[Speaker 2]
starlight i was just speculating as someone not very learned in magic type deal no worries

[Speaker 1]
well now learned in arcane magic so there's a plus two uh blood whale vial and a plus two arcane grimoire and the discovered items plus two what arcane grimoire i know somebody that can use this okay uh there was also i mean here 790 gold and 568 gold can you post it in chat okay

[Speaker 3]
that's it here i'll uh do the calculation for the total it also has three healing potion oh i should have put slash and roll all right so the the reward was 5k right yep all right so this is the total split between the three of us it's uh

[Speaker 2]
two one one nine for each and the bruce's sheet now there you go to bruce's sheet because he's also there oh yeah it's divided by four sorry

[Speaker 3]
this is my bad no problem 790 plus 68 plus 5k

[Speaker 1]
1000 so divided by four that's 1000 so for session xp between this session and the last one you're all going to get 7320 experience points uh bruce is going to get uh this is

[Speaker 5]
the only one i'm doing what's up uh i wasn't a part of the last one so right uh bruce also wasn't

[Speaker 1]
so i think and so out of last week's share that means this would have been uh yeah those of you who were here last week which is mark and are going to get an additional 11 okay so an additional 11 mark and betelheart additional 1100

[Speaker 5]
jaco just leveled up gosh uh what did you say it was for this session

[Speaker 1]
it's in the chat but it's 7320 oh there it is

[Speaker 3]
going on all right let's go into ranger yeah so finally get a

[Speaker 1]
oh we started on the 14th yeah it's since past okay 4 14 20 well one skill proficiency let's go with nature also let's see here you have a uh you have a hireling oh yeah it's going to take some xp uh so i think he gets half your xp so that's out of the total of 8,420 so your hireling gets 4,210 experience okay uh

[Speaker 3]
and second i have to pop it into the calculator uh how much 1410 4,200 okay all right what are you all right uh calculator because the experience isn't adding automatically

[Speaker 1]
if he was level three he should have had 900 experience already yes he had a thousand yeah that's right because he should have had a little bit more from your adventuring

[Speaker 3]
yeah so then now he has this so he's level four midway through he's a marshal apprentice right

[Speaker 2]
yes okay it's take average on level up or roll oh you roll good hi mr knolls my name is kat um

[Speaker 11]
dakota northern cheyenne um and they have been here for time immemorial and so that leads into

[Speaker 3]
my question so um for christ in ancient greece there were oh yeah um james do you use uh natural explorer deft explorer or both or either sorry i need you to explain to me what that means uh so ranger has the option the variant features right from tasha's right yes yes so do you use

[Speaker 1]
those or not you you're free to swap them out if you wish yeah uh this i will tell you the this module was made with the player's uh handbook ranger in mind um if you if you like for instance if you pick your favorite terrain from one of the terrains that are on this uh they're on this map you will have advantage for of your exploration checks uh in the exploration roles in that given uh in that given terrain all right

[Speaker 3]
uh let's see i would probably say that my favorite terrain is forest so what is this terrain where are you looking uh the terrain north of Bronloch this one oh of course all right yeah so forest good night all hi buddy good night yeah i think

[Speaker 1]
good session you guys did really good on uh you guys are really good on combat tonight

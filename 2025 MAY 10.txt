[Speaker 3]
Scaling it up, we're just having it at 100. Here we...

[Speaker 2]
Are you on a plane?

[Speaker 1]
Is that what it's... Is that what it's doing right now? What the fuck?

It's totally on a plane.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, it's back to normal now.

[Speaker 6]
It's a virus.

[Speaker 3]
No, it just sounds like you have a fan going to me.

[Speaker 1]
I have, like, a ceiling fan. That shouldn't be doing... I mean, I guess there's no reason why it wouldn't be making a shit ton of noise.

Um... It was dumb of me to assume otherwise, but still. It's not the worst.

I have definitely heard worse.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I... Oh, my... It is at least not directly blowing into the mic.

[Speaker 5]
All right, guys. I'm gonna eat a potty bag of Doritos while not muting my mic.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, dear. Take 68 damage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, my god, was there a...

[Speaker 2]
Does Pathfinder have the thing where you instantly die if you take, um... Your damage over the season? Plank got to experience that one.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
So for that to happen in one strike, you need to take enough damage that equals double your health. It will instantly kill you to massive damage. When someone could hit, so it's even higher than...

[Speaker 1]
I just love how many crits there are in Pathfinder's second edition. Probably because you're using the wrong enemies. It's not a wrong enemy.

It's a overland encounter.

[Speaker 4]
Wrong enemy.

[Speaker 1]
It's your wrong enemy. It's not my wrong... I just work here.

[Speaker 3]
You're literally God.

[Speaker 1]
No, I just work here.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not going. I just work here.

[Speaker 1]
There's a manticore on the dice. That's the manticore's territory now. What can be done?

I have a folder called hollows.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I lost Para for a second. Because she was in the thing.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna drag you over there. All right, so I believe tonight we're doing Tor Bell, which is the hollow.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 2]
We've been clan card again! Yay!

[Speaker 1]
You have indeed! Everyone can pick...

[Speaker 5]
I love the potty tree.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody can pick a brief encounter or exploration state roll.

[Speaker 3]
Which one would click make?

[Speaker 5]
Does he have detect magic?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, does he? Yeah, should Nessie bring a secondary character until Clink is available? Yes.

Okay. I'm gonna drag him off then.

[Speaker 4]
Clink is just gonna come through a door, but he's not gonna open it. He's just gonna go right through it.

[Speaker 3]
Hero closet. Technically, he has to get a feat for that first.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, man.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, who's a full spellcaster? Tynran? Kyran?

[Speaker 6]
Can I bring Vair? I'm just trying to think.

[Speaker 3]
Jenny, Agnes, or Monk is who I'm thinking. I know Pera's a full spellcaster. What is Manaya?

Odd. Oh, she's a witch. Okay, so we have three.

I need to bring the dead boy.

[Speaker 6]
Huge is an alchemist, but I kind of wanna bring Vair because it's a necromancer. Or he's going to be a necromancer.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it would be funny.

[Speaker 6]
I also made a fighter as well if we need a frontline.

[Speaker 5]
I'm fairly confident Nova can hold the frontline, but maybe not if we fight another mythical.

[Speaker 4]
I built my thief to be a companion, but he's not one anymore. He's the main character, I suppose, that I'm going to be playing. Congratulations.

So I don't know if he's very useful. That's the point I was making. I don't know how well he is in a fight.

[Speaker 5]
Rogues work good as a second line character. You don't want to be taking too many hits, but you can.

[Speaker 4]
Stab and step back.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you'll be playing well around flanking with the frontline and being sneaky.

[Speaker 1]
Avoid Noda, this is so original.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, Pera never got to do stealth before. She always rolled below a 10. And now it is secret, so I will not know.

Oh, excuse me, that was not secrets.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I guess I should roll stealth as well.

[Speaker 5]
Well, avoid Noda doesn't have the secret. Oh, it doesn't?

[Speaker 3]
That would explain why clicking on the button didn't make it secret.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it just has exploration. I guess it's only the sneak action that has the secret tag, but it...

[Speaker 3]
Seek has the secret tag. That's weird.

[Speaker 4]
Do I do a private GM roll or a blind GM roll?

[Speaker 5]
A blind for a secret. But Seek isn't the exploration action either, though.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm doomed. All right, what would be a good exploration thing right now? Because I can't hit the little macro because no tokens are selected technically.

[Speaker 5]
Search is the exploration version of Seek. It is also not a secret check.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
No worries.

[Speaker 4]
I actually want to take back my... Should I be searching for traps?

[Speaker 5]
We only need one person to do it, unless they rolled badly. Ah, Minaya is searching.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just gonna be stealthy then.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, having the drop on anyone we fight's nice.

[Speaker 6]
I did so bad, please, Search. Can I have my arrows poisoned?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 4]
You can also re-roll that.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you should use your hero point on the first check of the session.

[Speaker 4]
Hera has a 9 in percussion.

[Speaker 6]
Please. Um, Hooch has also got a few healing potions if people would like some spare. There is two healing potions for the party if someone wants to, like, if anyone wants to grab one.

That's fair. They last only for this day. So, you know.

[Speaker 3]
What do you mean healing? You mean healing elixirs, right?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
That one.

[Speaker 3]
Like I said, Hera's a healer, so I'm pretty confident.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah, so there's two timber one of those if someone in the party would like to grab one. I do make it known that I do have a variety of vials and goodies on me.

[Speaker 5]
We'll feed them to you if you go down. They can just stay on your body.

[Speaker 6]
No? No one wants fun just in case someone else with a heal goes down? Things like that?

Nope.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's okay. We'll die with honor.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I believe James rolled 433 manticores in the next room, so...

[Speaker 1]
Sounds like it's quite how that roll goes.

[Speaker 5]
It'll be like a sauce engine where you open the door and they just burst in, crushing us instantly. Real Tomb of Horror style trap. Do we have a light source?

Hera could be a light source, but I feel like that defeats the purpose of stuffing.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I can put light on some somebody.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no, I've got a light source. I got- I have dim light. We're good.

[Speaker 2]
Imagine not being able to see in the dark. Could not be me. What if I can't?

[Speaker 5]
Um, something in dim light is concealed, so that's a dc5 flat shack target.

[Speaker 4]
I have low light vision.

[Speaker 5]
I have dark vision.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, same!

[Speaker 1]
Great. Go ahead, everybody, add yourselves to the encounter. We're gonna start off with a combat encounter.

[Speaker 7]
Ooh!

[Speaker 4]
How did I do on my stealth in that case?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you would use your stealth as initiative. So did you just reroll as initiative?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I did a blind roll for stealth. Do I- should I go ahead and do initiative stealth or just perception?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, if you add yourself to initiative, James can set it to what you rolled.

[Speaker 1]
I like that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, perfect.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I just rerolled stealth as initiative. That's Dumbledore's character. Nice.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
It has some mutton chops.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, also, I could just reveal it to everybody. Um, you guys super succeed. You both crit succeeded.

So congratulations on your first rolls of the night.

[Speaker 6]
Where did I roll mine? Mine's under the search action.

[Speaker 1]
Wow. There was a stealth, which was also good.

[Speaker 4]
Wild, a 27. Uh, were you setting my initiative to my stealth or was I rolling stealth for initiative?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I will do that manually. I didn't- I couldn't remember if you were able to do that manually. Is Minaya searching or stealthing?

Am I- Oh, you were searching. He was searching, but she did a terrible job.

[Speaker 3]
Are you sure? She got a nine? Didn't you roll twice?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right, yes, I did. Because I did one for the proper seek, which was hidden from me. So I was like, oh, should I roll again?

And then, you know.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the first one you rolled was for- was a 24. So I'm gonna say that's good. 24, so I'm gonna say that's good.

You find- Trapdoors. And you are aware of large spiders underneath them. Actually, I should put that, like, here and here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, boy. Good catch. Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Ugh, spiders. Let's go! If you'd like, you guys could- How does surprise work in Pathfinder 2nd Edition?

[Speaker 3]
I have not yet had to- Okay, so surprise in Pathfinder works. Everybody makes their rolls. And the order is the order.

So basically, like, if you had five guys and five players, and the five players all rolled stealth, and then the five dudes rolled stealth, anyone who got a hire knows about the stealth people. Or they know that they're there, but, like, they don't necessarily know where they are, and they have to seek them. But if they're after the players, then they have no idea and they're off-guard.

There's not really, like, free rounds in Pathfinder.

[Speaker 1]
They're off-guard is a significant route. It is.

[Speaker 3]
Because it reduces their AC.

[Speaker 1]
Was it a 27 or a 24? It was a 27.

[Speaker 4]
Which means I need to figure out what to do. Are these the enemies?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yep. So the hunting spider will- I did hear spider.

[Speaker 5]
So that one- Its initiative has actually beat the stealth DCs of everyone, so I don't think it needs to- Um.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I guess- Is it still it-meets-it-beats for even a nat 20 on Siren?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I don't know about a nat 20.

[Speaker 3]
Because nat 20 raises it up one, so I would think- Unless the spider also rolled a nat 20.

[Speaker 1]
The spider also rolled a nat 20, that's the problem.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well then I think- I think it would cancel out then. Yeah. But there's no crit success on Sneak though.

[Speaker 1]
Is there not?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I'll quickly check if there is one on- There is on avoid notice. Um, I'm fairly certain that he knows where everyone is, but I could be wrong.

[Speaker 1]
I'll have him just go after Nova, being rather close.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's what I do when these things come up.

[Speaker 1]
The attack is a- Ooh, a near hit.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm off guard to the first attack, but that one is still a hit without it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you become off guard by the poison.

[Speaker 5]
Poison.

[Speaker 1]
That's pretty cool. And for grappling, how does this- How do I roll for this?

[Speaker 5]
An athletics check. Again, if you target me and then do it, I think it should- Um, is there not like a button for grab?

[Speaker 1]
Might be one in basic action, but I don't know what it is.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there's a grapple in there.

[Speaker 1]
I suppose technically you should be like in here. I'm just gonna shift him over. Oh, they're trapped doors.

Uh, does grapple also take the multi-attack penalty?

[Speaker 5]
Um- I believe it does. That sounds right. I- I know some of them don't, if it's a creature ability.

I know in- This one's just roll for it.

[Speaker 1]
But that is his turn. From now it's his turn.

[Speaker 4]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
He gets knocked prone from the crit fail.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it just falls into its hole.

[Speaker 4]
All right, I'm flanking him. Um, and I'm going to- Strike.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, don't forget to turn on your rogue stuff. Huh? Um, you should have sneak attack on off guard, which is flanking.

[Speaker 4]
How do you- Where do I find that?

[Speaker 3]
There should be a button in your actions tab that says like turn on for off guard targets or something.

[Speaker 5]
Saren actually can't flank. Oh. Because Saren's tiny, you have to be in their squad to attack them.

You can't physically flank a creature. But it is prone, so it's off guard.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I don't have a sneak attack thingy.

[Speaker 3]
Don't you have a rogue? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, let me- There's not a checkbox at the top of your actions. I'm scared. Enable abilities that require an off guard target.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Does that, um, does that affect my damage or my roll?

[Speaker 3]
Um, it will affect your damage, I believe. Yeah, because then you get your sneak attack.

[Speaker 7]
Hey!

[Speaker 5]
You would need to be standing in its square, which is the pit trap. Are you flying?

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I can.

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Uh, well then, uh, I'll just go fuck myself. Um.

[Speaker 1]
Right now the spider's kind of blocking the trap door.

[Speaker 5]
Stand on the spider.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I can be on top of him. And then I can use my second action to jump off. Go away.

Or my third action to jump off and go away.

[Speaker 5]
Sure. That checks out.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I mean, that's a pretty fun, uh, rogue tactic.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, and then I'll just go over here with, um, uh, our bird friend. Hello, bird friend.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Shooch. Hooch.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, look, sorry, I was on mute. I'm going to try for, uh, to get the spider. And I think I'm gonna do that one again.

Okay, that is not letting me do that. Um, it's not letting me do my attack.

[Speaker 3]
Is it giving you an error? No.

[Speaker 2]
Are you targeting a creature?

[Speaker 6]
Yes. What attack is it? A vial of alchemist fire.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have it drawn?

[Speaker 6]
It says I don't have any available. Okay, it's bugging out. Never mind, I know what it is.

All right, sorry. There you go. And I throw a vial at the creature.

[Speaker 1]
All right, well that hits, so go ahead and roll there.

[Speaker 6]
And I'm going to take a second one and I'm going to quick alchemy. And I'm going to make an alchemist fire. And then I'm going to throw it at the second spider.

For a map. I think I'll move down here as my third action. That is my turn.

Still deal splash damage.

[Speaker 1]
That'll apply one damage. This is really nowhere else for it to land, right? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Is that my boy? Monk! Hello.

[Speaker 3]
Honey, I can't tap it right now. Okay, you'll tap it. Why are you enfeebled?

I have no idea.

[Speaker 1]
What's the matter, buddy? Tap it.

[Speaker 6]
Good job. No.

[Speaker 1]
No. She does.

[Speaker 3]
Did I give him people play something? Should be gone already. I don't know why you're enfeebled, so I wouldn't know.

Some of them.

[Speaker 1]
I'm taking it off. Kill it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm trying. I couldn't get stumbling stance to be in to be in effect. Man, I am all over the place.

It's like I haven't played this game.

[Speaker 1]
It's cooperative.

[Speaker 3]
Is it dead? Does an 18 kill it?

[Speaker 1]
18 damage? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
We did it, guys.

[Speaker 5]
What a level up. Who leveled up? Unaccessible.

[Speaker 1]
It's now instituting another rule from AD&D. You have to spend a number of weeks training equal to your level. You have to go back to town.

No kidding. That's awesome. What?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I think I was like, oh, I think someone just ate something. I'll be right back.

[Speaker 5]
You were eight XP up leveling.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. And now you kind of experience like, oh, sad. Did you?

[Speaker 5]
Are there any goodies in the trap door?

[Speaker 1]
Are there any goodies in the trap door? Yes. Turn my camera off.

Don't fall in. What? She was selfishly using the the kitchen bar to enjoy a nice evening meal, as opposed to letting me.

Why are you running back and forth? It has been very distracting. Oh, you find a pouch with 14 gold.

[Speaker 7]
Nice.

[Speaker 5]
How many of us are there? Six.

[Speaker 4]
That would be like two gold and some silver. We can divide it later. Indeed.

I'm sure there will be more money.

[Speaker 5]
It's a repeating number. Yeah, we can't.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so let's just wait for more gold. Also, is there anything interesting about the spiders?

[Speaker 1]
Are there spiders?

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Onwards. Oh, can I have some poison? Do you have the fate that lets you harvest things from animals?

There is a fate for that? I think it's like a seventh level range of fate. It lets you use animal carcasses to reduce crafting costs.

I guess getting poison from them would be different to that. Any complaints with me kicking this door in?

[Speaker 2]
Zero complaints. Let's go.

[Speaker 5]
If I will, release a hand from...

[Speaker 3]
Pera's in a trance right now. Yeah, sorry. Pera's out of her trance right now.

Just wanted to make sure no one was dying.

[Speaker 1]
Reasonable. Where's the... All right, so what's up?

You can't have a door anymore.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Can my belt help me here? Nope.

[Speaker 4]
Kick it. Yay! Nova smash!

[Speaker 1]
Succeeds!

[Speaker 5]
Is it a correct success or a regular success?

[Speaker 7]
Poison pluck, no.

[Speaker 4]
Glad it was Nova. Yeah!

[Speaker 6]
Everyone's been defeated.

[Speaker 1]
All right, folks, give me like... Five minutes.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, good.

[Speaker 1]
Five minutes.

[Speaker 5]
Or less.

[Speaker 1]
If anyone has knowledge checks they would like to do across the course of this dungeon, there are plenty of excuses and reasons to do so.

[Speaker 5]
Knowledge checks.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, my scientist is left at home. Sorry. Knowledge check?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like, is there something noteworthy to do a check about?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. You could do the history of the thing. The history of the hollow.

Depending on what you've heard in town or the people that you've heard about. Critters, people have... Somebody recovered a specter or wraith or shadow of some kind.

[Speaker 4]
A shadow, yeah. What can I do with that?

[Speaker 1]
You can interrogate him. That's technically knowledge checks.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. You can try. But I'm also a faerie, so would I have any knowledge on this being a fae?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
I could intimidate it.

[Speaker 1]
Likely more so than whatever your role is. That's a helpful four-step system.

[Speaker 4]
How do I do a recall knowledge, folks? Is that in my macro?

[Speaker 3]
You click your token, you go into the basic action macro, and then you hit the recall knowledge, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 3]
But I think asking questions is a different role.

[Speaker 4]
I could ask my...

[Speaker 3]
That would be a make impression.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy, I'm just as good at recall knowledge as I am at make impression, which is a zero.

[Speaker 3]
Well, recall knowledge is going to show a zero by default. But it's actually whatever the skills are.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well, I did a recall knowledge. Because I don't remember anything about the shade. I don't remember if he's friendly or if...

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And if he wasn't friendly originally. So recall knowledge, you know that he's probably been bound by the... He's probably been bound.

[Speaker 4]
I was doing the recall knowledge for the hollow.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Yeah, all right. So you're going to be like one step...

[Speaker 7]
No, Augie, come here.

[Speaker 1]
For success. Okay. You know, on a related note, you will have to give me a milk.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll be right back, guys.

[Speaker 1]
It's not intended to still target Nova. I don't know why. Let me untarget Nova.

Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
Need to make more Nova JFK memes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, they're cutting so many onions. I'm starting to feel it up here. Holy shit.

Whoa. I might have to institute an onion on it. Jesus.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm good now. Okay, in the next room is a...

[Speaker 4]
Manticore.

[Speaker 1]
Singular pixie.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, excuse me. Pardon me.

[Speaker 1]
With regards to your knowledge check earlier...

[Speaker 3]
What's a pixie like you doing in a place like this?

[Speaker 1]
With regards to your knowledge check earlier, uh, you know that the Torbell is headed by the Maid of Winamere. She's fond of... She's fond of binding spirits, as are most of the courts associated with the Underdark or the World Below.

Especially in this region. So she has a... She has a big affinity for spiders.

She has a big affinity for spirits. She's not too interested in the City of the Dead itself. She prefers more to do information broker style things.

Like she's interested in binding wraiths for the sake of finding out what they know.

[Speaker 4]
Would this pixie be bound?

[Speaker 1]
This pixie is a regular pixie. So she might be bound by the laws of hospitality or things like that. But she's not going to be bound by...

Well, she could be bound. She could have a contract. If she's here, then she's probably native.

[Speaker 5]
Just double-checking.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, the party's all... I mean, they're webs.

[Speaker 5]
Hello! What are you doing here, Nervous Epps? After kicking the door in.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I'm here to see if anyone was going to come along and... I think I'm waiting for you, actually. Waiting for us?

[Speaker 5]
Me specifically?

[Speaker 1]
People in general? You have a stench of someone who recently died upon you?

[Speaker 5]
A friend?

[Speaker 1]
Companion?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, my buddy Nervous getting teary-eyed.

[Speaker 1]
Provider of alcohol?

[Speaker 5]
It smelled all the way?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, that's me.

[Speaker 1]
Who shares alcohol? Oh, thank you. Your tears are lovely.

Thank you for this gift.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, what?

[Speaker 1]
So the rest of the Hollow is getting a little bit of a makeover. The local queen is getting... Maid of Windmere is getting ready for a little bit of a...

Oh, what did you say? A performance? A ballad?

There's supposed to be an invasion again. So recently we've been shoring up the basement.

[Speaker 4]
Doing what to the basement?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shoring it up.

[Speaker 4]
Uh-huh. What does that mean?

[Speaker 1]
Making it more difficult, reinforcing it, making it more difficult for people to get inside. Unfortunately, a lot of miscreants had invaded the basement already, so, you know. There's still a section that opens up into the Glade proper though, so you'll be able to make it there.

I believe that the lady has an objective for you, but she's also willing to restore your companion.

[Speaker 5]
Great, how do we get there?

[Speaker 1]
Just follow the... So there's three spiders she would like you to collect across the dungeon, and you just have to put those near the door case. Sorry, the door case, near the staircase.

Which leads up to a door. I'm going to write that down, actually.

[Speaker 5]
Three spiders, you said?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. You'll know them when you see them. They have a gem embedded in the back.

[Speaker 5]
Okey-dokey. Let's go!

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'm gonna sneak. I'm gonna hang back and sneak.

[Speaker 1]
Sure thing. You can see the weblurker deadfall, which you had seen last time you were here, is currently... Well, this one in particular was styled as like a noose that was supposed to come up when the boulders fell, and did catch somebody, and somebody has been n-webbed.

[Speaker 4]
Do they have anything in their pocket?

[Speaker 1]
I've got all of them. No, they actually have something that looks like a spider, attached to the front of their chest.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wonderful. Okay, well they, you know, they're enjoying a meal. That's good for them.

I'm gonna not check their pockets.

[Speaker 2]
Are they dead or something?

[Speaker 1]
Probably.

[Speaker 2]
If not, they wish they were.

[Speaker 1]
Well, they're not moving.

[Speaker 2]
Cool, I'll check the pockets then. Um, I will...

[Speaker 4]
do my best to get a- Are you sure they have a spider on them?

[Speaker 2]
That's okay. I like- I can eat them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, when I say the spider, I mean one that kind of looks like it has a gem in the back.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh, splendid! I will take that.

Just pocket it. Well, eat it? I'm not quite sure how to do this, but yes.

Um, I would like to check their pockets, please.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to move your character up next to this deadfall for me?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, fun. Okay. I have moved them.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. And everybody, add yourself... to the encounter.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, before the encounter, can I switch my, uh, shortbow- or my daggers out for a shortbow?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Since we know there's spiders up ahead.

[Speaker 1]
Next time you want to do that ahead of time.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Oh! Oh, ma.

What the hell?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, um, I rolled a...

[Speaker 4]
I rolled for stealth. Um, I rolled a 21 for stealth. I forgot to do it secretly.

Should I roll initiative for 12? Uh, 12? Uh, stealth, not 12.

[Speaker 1]
One more time?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, do I roll initiative for stealth?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, use your stealth for initiative. Um, you can. Sorry for you two.

And then I'm literally the last one. Hey, I love how much of a high initiative these guys have.

[Speaker 5]
Rest in peace, Minaya. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
So it truly is a grudge against the birds.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
See?

[Speaker 1]
I missed. Let me try it again.

[Speaker 6]
What can you say? These are birding spiders.

[Speaker 5]
Did it roll an attack while still just seeing private dice rolls?

[Speaker 1]
Are you seeing private dice rolls? Oh, shoot. Hey, that hits.

It's still a taste arrest.

[Speaker 5]
What? Your default's set to private.

[Speaker 1]
Why is my default set to private?

[Speaker 3]
Because it's probably a hidden creature.

[Speaker 1]
Tell everyone what's going on, man. He has a visibility state. I don't know what's going on there.

[Speaker 5]
We don't see him in initiative. Initiative also hasn't started.

[Speaker 1]
What does it take to drag somebody with you?

[Speaker 5]
You can drag one thing at a time.

[Speaker 1]
You see here it says the target is grabbed until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target escapes. I'm also going to have it attack to keep it simple. All right.

Was that secret?

[Speaker 5]
I think it needs an ability to be able to move the creature it's grabbing.

[Speaker 1]
That's actually fine.

[Speaker 5]
I know there are feats for it.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. Manaia.

[Speaker 2]
Ouch. Okay. I shall...

Please take the ability. Effects. Stoke the heart, everyone.

Or I can drag it onto you guys. Yes, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
Stoke the heart is one creature.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, darn. I thought it was a multi... Multitude one.

Well, Nova can take it. Please, Ouch, extract yourself. Extract it for yourself.

Thank you. And then I'll just give myself this since I'm currently in the clutches of a spider. And then for my other things...

Can I still attack even when grappled?

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, splendid. All right, let me go get this thing. And then we cast...

Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Um, yeah, you need a flat shack.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I succeeded.

[Speaker 5]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
That missed. I'm going to re-roll that because that is embarrassing for me. Ah, wait, hold on.

I forgot to update the hero points thing. All right, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Well, there it is.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, six damage to the, um, spider. And that shall be the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Hurrah!

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I am going to... Oh, needle darts is 60 feet. Okay, I'm gonna needle darts it.

Oh no, I'm gonna re-roll it.

[Speaker 4]
There you go. Much better.

[Speaker 3]
There we go, you get eight. And then with my last action, I am going to stay where I am. Um, is there someone underneath me?

There is.

[Speaker 5]
Is there anyone?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. That will be my actions. Oh, wait.

Actually, since I have an extra action, I'm gonna recall knowledge about spiders.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
That way I'm not just wasting an action. Um, let me target you, spider. Let me recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It's a hunting spider. You know that the, you know from earlier that the local lady really appreciates spiders and likes, and likes setting them up.

So, just briefly, what do you get for recall knowledge, generally?

[Speaker 3]
Um, you learn... Yes.

[Speaker 1]
You can save it until later.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, I don't feel like I need to know what it is. I guess, what is its weakest save?

[Speaker 1]
Weakest is will.

[Speaker 3]
Interesting.

[Speaker 1]
You know that because its eyes are actually a little glazed over. This critter is being, uh, bred for a special kind of magical firearm. The name of which is the provocative spider gun.

[Speaker 2]
Does it, does it shoot spiders?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so.

[Speaker 3]
There is a spider bomb.

[Speaker 1]
This is a spider gun.

[Speaker 2]
Splendid.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, anyway, that's my turn. Oh my god, I cannot see anything.

[Speaker 5]
First action, stride. Second action, I will attack this thing non-lethally because Nova, Nova thinks we need it to open the door case, so. I think it's a pretty good reason to not.

I'm holding a crowbar, I spend an action to change my grip. My last action, I'll try and hit it. The minus two circumstance for non-lethal.

It's a miss. That is my turn.

[Speaker 6]
It's rough. Hooch. He's going to run up and he's going to quick alchemy an alchemist fire.

And he is going to then throw it at the creature. Oops.

[Speaker 1]
Hit. I keep forgetting it doesn't always roll this one. Oh, nice.

[Speaker 6]
And.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I tried clicking damage, but it told me no.

[Speaker 6]
Last action, he's going to move out of the way because he's not in a line. That is my turn. He's like, ooh, that burns even better!

I also do the bomber focus where it only splashes on a single target, not on everyone else around him.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I did the splash first and now it doesn't want to do the... I, in either case, it's it's dead. Which means it falls and Minaya is no longer grappled.

[Speaker 6]
Minaya. Yeah, so it's, uh, the bonus just lets you, the splash, I can focus the splash only on one target. So I don't want to splash anyone else.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, thanks.

[Speaker 1]
The spider's body falls on the fire.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, query question. Can I fly here or am I still sort of grabbed?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's, it's not... Do you have a reaction fly? Oh, do you?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I have action fly, not reaction fly.

[Speaker 3]
Then no, you would not be able to then.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it would not be relevant to what's about to happen to you.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Would you like me to make a reflex save, too?

[Speaker 1]
No, I don't think you're in the, uh, I don't think you're in the... I would love for you to be. I would love for it to be just like a 30 foot square.

That's, that's reasonable.

[Speaker 3]
Monk helps Minaya out.

[Speaker 1]
Did Minaya take damage? I'm still waiting on Minaya to make that reflex save.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
I was waiting for the damage.

[Speaker 2]
I just... No, it's... okay, I fail.

You can use a thingy. I just used my hero point. Oh, damn.

Yep. Ouch. Damage.

I'll live. Uh, probably.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's when the computer's supposed to hear you.

[Speaker 2]
Why, thank you, monk. And I, can I... Can I still look through the pockets of this spider?

[Speaker 3]
He walked away. Uh... Spider pockets.

Monk will dust Minaya off like she was dirty, but it's really just him conjuring dirt. Dust bath, let's go! Someone needs to make a genchilla that's monk's best friend.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god, yes. I was, wait, whose pockets were I looking through before I got into the whole spider scenario?

[Speaker 1]
There's a spider-bound, there's a thread-bound corpse right in front of you. Oh. Can I continue looking in his pockets?

Yes, you can. There is a... Thank you.

Where's my list? There is a weapon potency rune plus one on a coat pistol.

[Speaker 4]
Oh hell yeah, I'll take that.

[Speaker 1]
As well as a missive mint.

[Speaker 4]
Uh-oh. I'm stuck. Why are you stuck?

I don't know, I'm just stuck.

[Speaker 1]
Also a beacon shot and 19 gold.

[Speaker 4]
What were the last items?

[Speaker 5]
Ah. There's a beacon shot and 19 gold.

[Speaker 1]
And a missive mint.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just a monk. Whoa.

[Speaker 5]
Is the beacon shot an arrow or a bolt?

[Speaker 1]
It is an...

[Speaker 2]
Uh, apologies for dipping, my computer died. What was in those guys' pockets? I did miss that.

[Speaker 5]
It is a bolt. There is a plus one, uh, dueling pistol, I believe. Missive mint.

Uh, a beacon shot bolt. And 19 gold.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is a, this is a coat pistol.

[Speaker 5]
Coat pistol, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, well, it can be added to the party general due to the fact I don't think I can hold a pistol.

[Speaker 3]
Monk wants it.

[Speaker 2]
As, I guess, graceful thanks for getting you, getting her out of the spider's grasp, it shall be given. Oh, you're taking everything else? Oh, no, well, what was else?

Missive mint and beacon shot. I don't know what those do. Beacon shot was the gun.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so everything is now on the, uh, everything's now on the hunting spider token, if you would like to use that for thievery.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, thank you. Oh, a mint. It's actually a mint, nice.

I'm afraid that she is going to take it, but gentle encouragement will make her share. You're taking the rounds? You can take the rounds.

[Speaker 1]
You can take the gun, I'm taking the ammo.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. What a good deal. It was tempting, but no.

[Speaker 3]
Like the best friend necklaces.

[Speaker 6]
Amazing. Can I have the candy?

[Speaker 2]
Which person is asking this?

[Speaker 6]
Which?

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Minaya spits it out of her mouth. Hold on.

[Speaker 6]
I thought it was going to my mouth. Save it for later.

[Speaker 2]
Um, Minaya will give it to you, but on the basis that she's probably going to take something from you later. But yes, spits it out, gives it to you.

[Speaker 6]
I, uh, grab something from the spider, just like... I rip his leg. I rip off like a spider leg, and I give it back to Minaya.

It's like, here you go. Yay!

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh. Accepted. All right, on we go then.

Thank you, James.

[Speaker 5]
I guess Nova will pick up the gem spider corpse. Take it with us.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you now have one of those.

[Speaker 2]
Splendid. We'll just, I guess, add it to the inventory of... gem spider corpse.

[Speaker 5]
I hope they aren't too unhappy about us killing all their spiders.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, they probably will be. Oof. But I can't be helped.

Actually, I can speak to spiders, but I don't have a very high charisma, so it actually can't be helped.

[Speaker 5]
Is there anything in the hampering webs, or are they just there to hamper us?

[Speaker 1]
They're for the purpose of hampering. Onwards!

[Speaker 4]
One here, I think we should disarm it. Oh, it's been disarmed.

[Speaker 5]
It's already set off, isn't it? If it happens again...

[Speaker 3]
Um...

[Speaker 4]
I do blind... Oop, no, blind gem. All right.

[Speaker 1]
One of the things you guys discovered last time is that this is, uh... there is a... a secret door.

Or there is a false wall, specifically, here.

[Speaker 4]
Let's take a look at it. Okay. Um...

Does it look like it has a clear... Are there any, like, things on the wall that I can pull, or bricks that are loose that I can push?

[Speaker 1]
I spent a little bit of time tapping the... Yeah, tapping the bricks. You push in one, and it goes all the way in.

The door does not open, but there is a very small passage leading into the next room that's actually above this false wall.

[Speaker 2]
Did a tiny creature theoretically wiggle through?

[Speaker 1]
A tiny creature is what this passage appears to be made for.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, splendid. Wiggling through. On we go.

[Speaker 4]
Do you think it leads back up there? Yeah, I think so.

[Speaker 2]
Right, pops back and says, Please. Okay, yeah, I'll go with you.

[Speaker 4]
We died together.

[Speaker 2]
Yay. So, how do we pass through this secret hole?

[Speaker 1]
I will drag you through in just a moment.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Did anybody actually end up asking that specter any questions? Or doing any checks on him?

[Speaker 3]
No. Cerys has it, so...

[Speaker 4]
I'm guessing after this we can ask the spirit some questions. The shade. The shadow.

Provided we don't die.

[Speaker 2]
We will probably live. Tell that to Klink.

[Speaker 6]
After trying the myth for a little bit, you're just like, No, I don't like this. You can have it back.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I guess you can just give it to me back, and I give you back the spider leg.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know how to transfer it back to you.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh, drag the little, um, from your inventory, drag it onto me.

[Speaker 6]
Onto your character?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, onto my character.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know where your character is. Is it behind the spider's lips?

[Speaker 2]
Um, yes, it's...

[Speaker 4]
Right here. Don't accidentally give it to Siryn. It's the...

Siryn's the on top of... Um, Minaya.

[Speaker 2]
What kind of bird is Minaya? Uh, crow. Hence the stealing.

Yeah. Her and Klink get along really well.

[Speaker 1]
Her familiar is a pigeon.

[Speaker 4]
Everyone should make a crow character, and we just have, like, a crow party.

[Speaker 3]
Otter has a game set up for a bird.

[Speaker 6]
Well, it's beautiful.

[Speaker 4]
It could be like a secret society of birds.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, did you hear about what a group of ravens are called? They're called an unkindness. How did they earn that?

I don't know. I'll have to do, uh... I'll have to look that up, but...

Let's see. They are ravens. Unkindness.

[Speaker 4]
They did something to earn that name.

[Speaker 6]
Clues are always around when bad things happen.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, apparently it was due to a misunderstanding of raven behavior. Because they thought that they were mean to their young, and obviously because they were linked to bad luck. Hence unkindness.

What'd y'all find down there? Oh, we're about to find out. Hold on, I want to take my pigeon buddy with me as well.

[Speaker 1]
Almost done. They changed some of these names past the, uh... Once the orc license was done.

There you go, I've unlocked the door. Yay!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, um... Yeah, I go behind you.

[Speaker 1]
All these are covered in webs, of course, but they're actually relatively easy to move through. When I say covered, it's just... They're kind of around.

Cobwebs, not really structured. Not reason. And the...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm taking the arsenic.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, uh... Minaya didn't take it because she... Obviously, not a fan of pest poison.

Please take the arsenic.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. What did you get?

[Speaker 2]
Also... Oh, uh... C.

I just grabbed it without thinking. It was shiny. Common in libraries, monastery, labs...

It glows as a torch. It's like a light stone. Oh, and the scarf!

[Speaker 4]
I will trade you something awesome. I don't have anything awesome, I don't think. Actually, do you want my shadow?

Hold on, what do I have? I'll trade you for that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll give you the scarf. You can trade me something good later. Where are you?

Oh, I'm on top of you. Sorry. Here you go.

You can trade me something cool later. I have something awesome for you.

[Speaker 4]
Are you ready?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I don't... You!

Seriously? Okay. Well, it'll be a nice gift to give Klink later, so...

All is well. I hope you enjoy the scarf. You're most welcome.

[Speaker 6]
Monk will also take alcohol.

[Speaker 2]
I am willing to trade. I am open to all sorts of trade. Hold on.

Oh, I collided with the wall. Would I roll perception to see if there's anything else that might be in the room?

[Speaker 5]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Secret check. It looks like the... Yeah, it looks like the wings of these pixies can be...

These pixie statues can actually be turned.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. May I do so?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. The first one turns to the right.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I will keep doing it till something changes.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, well, I'll start turning some too. Do I know anything about this?

[Speaker 2]
Sure.

[Speaker 4]
Should I do a recall knowledge?

[Speaker 1]
Double again. Yeah, here we go. Fae do love putting random shit for you to mess with in their hollows for the excuse, if you will, of attacking you.

[Speaker 4]
Ah! Okay, I'll relay that knowledge.

[Speaker 2]
I will stop touching the statue. All right, let's shimmy back through this tunnel.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. It's coming down the way of some jerks. Everybody, go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 6]
I was gonna say, it has been made clear that we're not too welcoming to you.

[Speaker 2]
Nessie, I don't know if you saw it, but I will happily give you the alcohol, literally for a jar of dirt, as long as you label it Elemental Dirt and then, I guess in brackets, From Monk.

[Speaker 5]
Bath. It's like Game & Go, bath, water.

[Speaker 2]
No!

[Speaker 3]
Are we all in initiative?

[Speaker 6]
I think this is like the third time I rolled 22 for stealth initiative.

[Speaker 4]
There's one person missing, I think. Okay, there you go.

[Speaker 3]
You were saying something, Hart, were you just telling me to roll initiative?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, I was saying something earlier, but remember how you said Monk would like alcohol? I said that I will happily give it to you for a literal jar of dirt from Monk, because he's an Elemental, so clearly Elemental Dirt is valuable.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I think it's everybody. I've got a jar of dirt!

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
All right, thank you for the jar of dirt, here is your alcohol. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Where is that gif? Oh god, it's a pixie. And I don't have a very good charisma skill, so I can't flirt with her.

To save a life.

[Speaker 1]
No, I can fly 45. Damn. Okay.

All right, well, that's their turn. See an arrow whiz past Nova and slam into the wall.

[Speaker 6]
You're muted, by the way. Uh, whoops, sorry. I said, well, there's something a little up there, and this is the same place as last time we came to, right?

Like, we know that there was, like, a guard in there, and...

[Speaker 1]
There was a what?

[Speaker 6]
This is the same place that we're in last time, where Klink died, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
So, like, this would be, like, where the guard's room was?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, she did come out of the guard's room, yeah. No, that is the same room that she came out of.

[Speaker 6]
And she's up there now, or is that just a different one?

[Speaker 1]
That's, uh, that's the one that shot.

[Speaker 6]
Ready, uh... I'm going to try pull up my blue dart and see if I can shoot it from here. So that's one pull out.

And then I'm going to do the poisoned arrow. I'm not sure how to do this on there, but this is the arrow with the Blackout of Venom. Nope, that's my turn.

How's it go?

[Speaker 1]
We have another pixie. I'm also going to sprinkle a little pixie dust. Wait, I have a spell.

I should not be able to talk. Plague Growth, amazing! Cool, all right, that's her turn.

I should have reversed those, but that brings us to Para. Their mystery in Stelmog.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, I don't want to move at the end. Um, I'm going to reach around the corner and touch Nova.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think that does anything.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, do you already have a plus one striking?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I bought a striking weapon.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, um, then I'll give that back to myself. And, um, I will cast Draconic Barrage. Um, I will choose Force.

Um, oh, interesting, it didn't make me choose a spell type. Uh, and I think that's it for now. It doesn't do damage until I sustain it, so.

[Speaker 1]
So I have to...

[Speaker 3]
So do I make the save now, or...? No, because it doesn't do damage until I sustain it. So, like, they're just floating around me right now.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that's pretty cool. Nova.

[Speaker 5]
Take an action to stride. Oh, there's a lot of guys in there.

[Speaker 1]
Hello. Now I am... I am hidden.

[Speaker 5]
Do I get stuck on the invisible pixie?

[Speaker 1]
No, I think you barely register it. I think Nova would barely register it.

[Speaker 5]
Well, she went off to getting stuck on it, is all.

[Speaker 1]
I think that... I guess... Oh, it's small.

Okay, I was under the impression it was tiny.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I guess I'll try and hit this one that's in the way. I'm kind of in their house, so I guess I'll do it non-lethally.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Um, and it should automatically do a flat check. It was a success, and a success to hit. 14 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez. I'm feeling poor, feeling like not a great time.

[Speaker 5]
My last action, I'll do it again. And I missed that one from the flat check. End turn.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I don't know what's going on, so I'm gonna go take a look. Oh boy, um... Uh, that thing right here, it's invisible, but I can still see it.

Why?

[Speaker 1]
It's, uh, so it's hidden, but it's not undetected by you, because it...

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I could...

[Speaker 1]
It became invisible, like, in view of you guys, so it has to go sneaking before it can become, like, really undetectable.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, critical miss. Um, is knocking an arrow an action, or can I just shoot again? Okay.

Jesus Christ, okay. All right, that's my turn. How do I, uh...

End turn. Oh boy. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Let's try down here. I'm gonna move on this side. My melee, I'm going to attempt to shank you.

Hey!

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I'm off guard because it's invisible.

[Speaker 1]
That one misses. That is his turn. This guy, similarly gonna slide around.

He's small, so I'm just gonna put him in these nice cramped quarters, and he's gonna do a technical choice. Missing once. Hey!

There we go. For a mighty one damage.

[Speaker 5]
He didn't do a crit, did he?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, it wasn't a natural 20. Wait, no, I did- Oh!

[Speaker 5]
This is struck above that crit me.

[Speaker 1]
Oops. Magnificent. Bring us to Manaia.

[Speaker 2]
All right, she's going to move because she cannot see anything. Ah, right, collision. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Actually, you do have to go around. There is a wall.

[Speaker 2]
Yes! Yes. And I'll also move my familiars so they can have some happenings of what's going on.

Great!

[Speaker 1]
A bunch of tiny dives shanking Nova from like the sides of the thing.

[Speaker 2]
Right. So once again, we'll provide an assist to Nova with a Stoke the Heart. And because she's on the front line, she can also get a Restored Spirit.

[Speaker 5]
Bless you.

[Speaker 2]
You're welcome. And then I'll try to hit the fairy right in front of her with needle darts. Oh, actually.

No, yeah. Needle darts. Oh, it's invisible.

I cannot see her. Never mind. I miss.

All right, that is my turn. I failed the flat check, so I can't. Wait, hang on.

I'm still quite... It was still counting me as grabbed.

[Speaker 5]
I think it's still just the one flat check though.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Is it the same flat? Oh no, the DC is 11.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to remove it, but yeah, I still fail.

[Speaker 1]
It's a principle of the thing. This one is going to run over and shank Nova.

[Speaker 5]
That one isn't flanking, I don't think. Ah, he just gets me.

[Speaker 2]
No, Nova looks a bit banged up.

[Speaker 5]
I'll stop clicking. No!

[Speaker 1]
That one, you take more damage.

[Speaker 5]
I do.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Later on, Onis get feats that make them stronger at half health.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hell yeah.

[Speaker 4]
What is an Oni?

[Speaker 5]
Onis are like an Asian demon. They brave battle.

[Speaker 6]
Aren't they equivalent to like our ogres or things of that nature?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, they're more spiritual in nature than an ogre.

[Speaker 2]
But they are comparable.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
I can't, uh, shoot a pistol for a Flurry of Blows, right? Not unless I have a feat. Flurry of Blows specifies, um, yeah.

Okay. Okay. Oh, but I can't see the fairy?

Is that what's been happening?

[Speaker 5]
You'd need to do a flat check to shoot it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Should I just roll a d20? Should I just roll a d20?

[Speaker 5]
No, you just targeted the attack.

[Speaker 1]
It'll do it automatically.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it'll do it? Okay. Yeah, roll first.

Okay. Nova hears a bullet whistle by her ear. Oh, shit!

Uh.

[Speaker 1]
Is there a two-way? Final mid-flirt. Oh, it's a 10-foot emanation.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Bane.

[Speaker 1]
This guy fails.

[Speaker 5]
It's just enemies in the area need to do it.

[Speaker 3]
This one does specify. Maybe his enemies with his friends. Yeah, he doesn't like that guy.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck him. If either one of them survives, there will be a story. They're not gonna survive.

That's his turn. Which means we come to this other pixie. And Nova is in volley range?

What's less effective at close distances? Okay. So we'll go for the back.

Oh, you little pixie dust. And then I'm gonna shoot you. Yes.

All right, make me a will save. Nova.

[Speaker 5]
Fail. Crit fail. Holy shit.

[Speaker 2]
Is this for the Bane?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is for...

[Speaker 5]
Hi.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, did you roll for the Bane? You did roll for the Bane.

[Speaker 5]
I did. I succeeded.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the effects of a third-ranked sleep spell.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, sleep is in cap. What level are the pixies?

[Speaker 3]
Um, it says third-ranked sleep spell.

[Speaker 5]
Third rank. That would be a... It's still a crit fail, sad.

Creature falls unconscious. I dropped my sword.

[Speaker 3]
Um, but it also does allow you to still wake up with a successful perception check in combat.

[Speaker 5]
I guess that would be at the start of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Good chance. All right, pooch.

[Speaker 3]
Ready. Yeah, if you take damage, if you receive healing...

[Speaker 6]
See, my companion has just fallen unconscious. I want to try to run up to him. Can't.

Ah, whoopsie, I got the tutorial. Interrupt him. Like, don't worry, I'll get you.

And I'll mix up a strange and wily concoction.

[Speaker 3]
You can also just shake him awake.

[Speaker 6]
But do I notice his sleep, or do I see he's just being knocked out?

[Speaker 5]
Nerva's not bloodied. You just got hit by an attack.

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to give you a potion, why are you opposed to this?

[Speaker 5]
Why not fall prone? You got hit by an attack. Oh, I didn't fall prone.

Nerva's just there, standing there.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, creature falls unconscious from this spell. Doesn't fall prone or release what it's holding.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
As you run up, Nerva's... They're just like, over and over and over. I use an action to shake him up.

No time for sleepy! Naughty! Bad!

Mack!

[Speaker 5]
Ah, what? You're asleep, I wasn't.

[Speaker 6]
And then I'll look at this guy, and then I'll try shooting with a dart. And then I go... That's my turn, done.

[Speaker 2]
Is this blow dart poison? No! Okay.

[Speaker 1]
She is going to move back. 35 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Can we see the dart sticking out of it?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, different enemy.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, the goblin guy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh!

[Speaker 6]
Go here, and then...

[Speaker 3]
Shit, when did those guys get there?

[Speaker 5]
Pretty much after I walked up, they started hitting me.

[Speaker 6]
There's the same guards that we saw last time, playing cards. This is the exact same guys? Can...

I was going to say, that'd be too much to threaten them in my turn, wouldn't it? Okay, like, next time you'll have something more powerful in there! Yeah!

And I'll shave my blue down at him. Yeah, it's his turn.

[Speaker 1]
We're coming out of the parrot.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I see that you have just cast a spell.

[Speaker 5]
Plant growth.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, she's handling four, and that means she's entirely different.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well, one of those is invisible. Can I be in the same space as the two small critters here? Or the two tiny critters?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. If you're, like, pushing past them. We just sort of...

[Speaker 3]
Um, so, since parrot can't see, like, anything... I'm going to... Uh, parrot reaches out and points at this one really far away.

And I need it to make a fortitude save as I shake its bones.

[Speaker 5]
I need to roll the... Oh no, they're really far away. Jeez.

[Speaker 1]
Oh! All right. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 2]
That's his... wow.

[Speaker 1]
That's really effective.

[Speaker 3]
It bone shook.

[Speaker 2]
It's uncomfortable conceptually, and it's powerful practically.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I love that I have access to the spell now. I love Bone Shaker. Anyway, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, was that the three action one or the two action one?

[Speaker 3]
That was the two action one, because I had to move.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that's... Do you want to move them? Oh man, that poor thing.

It's not doing so odd. Nova!

[Speaker 5]
Um, I guess I'll hit the guys around me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh shit, enfeebles. I didn't know that enfeebled.

[Speaker 5]
My first action, I will strike this guy just to the left of me. Um, these guys are trying to kill me. They can take a bit of punishment.

Oh, I may have killed this guy.

[Speaker 7]
Good.

[Speaker 5]
My second action, I'll heal for half of that. Um, I don't need to stride to get to any of these guys. Oh, that heals me for 16 points.

Bring me back to full. And I guess I'll just hit the guy to the right of me now. My second attack...

Miss. I'm done.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Siren!

[Speaker 4]
All right, so how do I see these guys? I missed that part.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the one really far away has not sneaked yet, so it's still... It's not undetected, it's just invisible. So if you try to act against it, you're gonna have to do a flat check.

[Speaker 4]
Are there guys, like, right here and right here?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, you've seen the tiny knives, uh, sticking out, trying to stab at Nova.

[Speaker 4]
Um, okay, well then I can shoot them, right? The thing... Where are they blocked?

[Speaker 1]
If you could see them, then you could fire on them. All right. I'll shoot at this guy.

Yeah, the guy you're shooting at now is probably the easiest to fire on.

[Speaker 4]
Did I shoot him? I have to scroll all the way fucking down. Yes, I did!

[Speaker 1]
You did!

[Speaker 4]
He takes eight damage. All right, let's do that again. Or unless he's dead.

Does he die?

[Speaker 1]
He's near death.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, one more. Come on, we got this.

[Speaker 2]
Yes!

[Speaker 4]
Die!

[Speaker 1]
He's bleeding out.

[Speaker 4]
All right, awesome. That's, uh, that's my turn. I'll hit and turn.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. I have a Mitflit, who is currently baned. So I'm going to have him spitefully cast Bane.

[Speaker 5]
I failed that one.

[Speaker 1]
And his knot buddy directly next to him also failed. So he is going to, I guess he's going to go for a quick jab. Which barely hits.

Three damage. That's a turn, isn't it, Aya?

[Speaker 2]
I was muted, sorry. Is this place full of plants or can I move in without getting entangled?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, can you fly?

[Speaker 2]
I will.

[Speaker 1]
Temporarily, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's see. Let's put her out. All right.

[Speaker 3]
This is the perfect use case for your fly. Hmm? It's the perfect use case for your fly.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, but I fall out of the... I don't have advanced flight, so I fall out of the air after the movement if I don't land. Only go like 10 feet in the air and then like...

Yeah. Yeah, no no no. This was specifically to move closer.

That's what I was asking. I wanted to cast Bless to counteract Bane. But I can't really do much about that.

Stoke the Heart yet again. That is not who I wanted to give Stoke the Heart to. Oh wait, it's Sustained for a minute.

I do not have to cast it again. Never mind.

[Speaker 5]
You do have to spend an action sustaining it.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, okay. So spend one action sustaining it. You still have it.

Uh, congratulations. And then I... No problem.

And then I will cast Needle Dartsy yet again. Oh, boo. Well, that is my turn.

Oh wait, hold on. I can reroll it. I've got a hero point.

Give me a second. Um, hmm. It's a Flint.

Sweet, success.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What? Is it rerolling the thing again? Or is an 18 a miss?

[Speaker 1]
18 is a miss. Can you... You should be able to see it.

I hope it sees it. It says it.

[Speaker 2]
No, I can see the thing. Oh well, that's my turn. Monk.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, it's difficult.

[Speaker 1]
Have you make a reflex save against... Have you make a reflex save against... Tangling for a...

Tangling. Head popping out. Make it.

[Speaker 3]
Woo. Can I walk normally?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
All surfaces in the area are difficult terrain. I don't know if that affects you.

[Speaker 3]
It does. It means I can only go 10 feet. Ish.

Yes, I can't really move because I'll be in huge space. Oh wait, no. Never mind.

Just kidding. It's good for that. I remember.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you got this.

[Speaker 3]
Why are these missions...

[Speaker 7]
Brrrrrr.

[Speaker 3]
Well.

[Speaker 7]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
How'd he got here? He's gonna... He's gonna go up and he's gonna try to get you.

Wait, he's in the area. He needs to make a 21. One second.

[Speaker 7]
Oh man.

[Speaker 1]
Never mind. Uh... I don't think he's gonna do anything.

Pixie! Oh, there's my heavily injured Pixie. No, things are looking not great.

So it's gonna fly. Oh, but... Action to interact.

Another action to interact. Now give the remainder of its participation.

[Speaker 6]
Hooch! All righty. Oh no.

Whoops. Um, I guess that guy's still there. So I'm going to throw a bomb at him.

I'm going to do quick alchemy. And I'm gonna do a light bomb. And then I'll throw it at him.

And I want to focus the splash just solely onto him. So don't hit my allies. Wait, who are you firing on?

The goblin? The dead? The dead one?

Ah, oh, he's dead. Yeah. Sorry, can I try to change it to that one?

I'll, uh, move up.

[Speaker 1]
You can. I believe it will miss by one. I also need you to make the reflex save.

[Speaker 6]
Reflex? Reflex is here.

[Speaker 1]
Holy shit. All right. So a 22 would miss him by one.

Unless you have something to boost it.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no, so he'll just take the one splash damage.

[Speaker 2]
You could do a hero point.

[Speaker 6]
You could? Yeah, I'll do a hero point. I think you even received an extra one earlier.

Yeah. So just do the attack again. I don't know how I'd bring it up to attack it again.

[Speaker 2]
Right click your attack and then do re-roll with hero point.

[Speaker 6]
Would I need to roll first just to make sure I can actually hit him? Because I didn't do the attack because I targeted the wrong creature.

[Speaker 1]
You already did. First, just roll it. Just re-roll it.

With the hero point. You targeted the wrong creature and would have missed the higher AC creature. I'm comfortable with establishing that would have been missed.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know where my attack is to re-roll it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it should be like right at...

[Speaker 7]
Huh.

[Speaker 6]
Am I missing my chance? I've got quick alchemy and then I've got the damage roll.

[Speaker 1]
Just roll whatever attack. Fucking anything, we don't need to... Okay.

All right, so it takes the splash.

[Speaker 2]
You get a plus 10 if you roll lower, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, so would I change that if I only miss while I want to do a plus 10? Oh, if you roll lower than the previous roll.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, last time it was a 21.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's if it's below 10.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, I see. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Well, nothing happens then.

[Speaker 6]
All right, I guess it's me done.

[Speaker 1]
Mifflet does not... I'm not trying to get the Mifflet to take damage. All right.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I couldn't see that attacking me because the Mifflet was on its side.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know where it went. That was the most annoying part.

[Speaker 6]
Me neither.

[Speaker 1]
Use your axe. I'm just going to walk back. That's going to be a weird turn.

Hera! Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, let's see. How far can I move? 12 feet.

What? What? Oh, because I want to avoid notice.

That can go away. Okay, 25. All right.

So I can pretty much go two squares into this.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I cannot see anything in there. I will go and I will move up to Nova. And that is where I will end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Nova! If you guys... I shall kill this guy.

Yeah, these two. You can end the combat if you desire.

[Speaker 4]
I'll kill him.

[Speaker 1]
I have to press this little button. Oh, he's dead.

[Speaker 5]
I'll then activate my Scar of the Survivor to heal. And I can move towards this guy that I can't see. I'm able to stand.

I need to move in a straight line towards him. Would that count for that purpose? Because I physically can't move.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can. It's just a...

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'm just going to move in a straight line. I'm going to hit him before he dies.

Um, multi-attack penalty five. That's a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Brings us to Seraph.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Um, I'm going to move up. I don't see this creature.

Is it in this room?

[Speaker 1]
Um. Which one? Uh, whatever.

The last, uh, little gremlin guy is in the...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. I can see him. Yeah.

All right. Um, I will shoot him. I need to stock up on arrows after this.

Oh, okay. I'm going to use a hero point. Fuck it.

Eight damage. And then I'll shoot him again. Oh, he's dead.

Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Super dead. If you guys would like, I could empty a counter there and you guys can...

[Speaker 5]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
I heard a yes. The eyes have it.

[Speaker 5]
What level encounter was that? Did the level ones get double?

[Speaker 1]
Did you guys get that XP? I just, uh, I got like a notification about something.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it looks like we got it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I think it was extreme.

[Speaker 5]
I think that would constitute as double for the level ones.

[Speaker 1]
Do we still have a level one?

[Speaker 5]
Me.

[Speaker 1]
I think there's two.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, you're in, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Is monk level one or is monk level two?

[Speaker 2]
He's level two. I have missed enough sessions that I'm still level one on this, on this last. All right, where are the level ones?

Uh, here, I'll move Siren into this, yeah, moving Siren into this little room. Oh yeah, okay. There we go.

Oh, wall collision. Give me a sec. Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
All right, just use him?

[Speaker 2]
I believe so.

[Speaker 1]
146. I really like that rule.

[Speaker 4]
Yay, oh my god, I, I have, uh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're so close. That's so sad.

[Speaker 4]
Is there anything I can do to boost that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can win your next fight. I think about it this way, if the next fight is like, really high level, then you're gonna get like a. You're like, you get to like, double dip on it.

[Speaker 5]
300%, holy shit.

[Speaker 2]
Quick question, what is in the mint, if anything? Or was nothing put into it?

[Speaker 1]
Remember, put stuff in the chat. Oh, right. Um, oh, interesting.

You put another deadfall in front of the second spider. Make sure to cover it with leaves.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, um. But I, but I will tell everyone that's what was in the mint and just go, whoa, that was strange.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, these gremlins, by the way, were trading back and forth about, uh, another, sorry, another 13 gold. And one of them had a playing card set.

[Speaker 2]
I, I did not take the gold nor the playing card set.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I didn't add them to the, we'll make this guy the leader.

[Speaker 2]
I'll put that.

[Speaker 5]
I've just been tallying up the gold if we want to split it all at the end.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that works well.

[Speaker 5]
We're currently at 46.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh.

[Speaker 5]
You'd buy a tower shield with that much gold.

[Speaker 1]
That's a lot of gold. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone want the playing cards? Because if you don't.

[Speaker 4]
Um, what do they do? Exactly.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. They're marked playing cards. So you can cheat.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, um, don't mind if I do. Unless somebody else really wants them.

[Speaker 6]
I'll play them for you. Play you for them.

[Speaker 4]
If you want them, you can have them. But my character is a scam artist, so. Which character is this one?

Um, this is Siren. He's a rogue, a thief. Oh hey, two thieves.

[Speaker 6]
The only way they should be rightfully owned is to win them. So we'll have a game at the end and whoever wins gets to keep it. Maybe it's more of a plot.

[Speaker 2]
What do we roll for this? Game lore?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Game lore.

[Speaker 4]
There's a thing for that? Alright, that, um.

[Speaker 6]
Electro theory.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, it says unrelated.

[Speaker 6]
You can also do sleight of hand if you're cheating.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think. Oh, I'm definitely cheating. I'm really doing sleight of hand.

[Speaker 6]
We have to do a three-year-old.

[Speaker 4]
Um.

[Speaker 7]
Ooh, look at this, look at this.

[Speaker 4]
Sleight of hand. Where is this macro at?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's just a- Oh shit, wait. Sleight of hand isn't a thing in here, is there?

[Speaker 6]
Nah, it's thievery.

[Speaker 4]
It's thievery? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Would underworld count? I feel like that's cheating though. Right?

Thievery it is.

[Speaker 5]
It'd have like a higher DC.

[Speaker 2]
Ah darn, you win.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, the master!

[Speaker 6]
Teach us! Teach us!

[Speaker 4]
How much is the- Well, where are they? How do I drag- Are they in the party sheet?

[Speaker 2]
No, they're- You know, you see that dead goblin next to you? They're in his pockets. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Thunderbough.

[Speaker 2]
Uh oh. Oh, right! I never gave you thanks for warning me about the, uh, the trap.

There you go. Ooh. What is this?

Three swords.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. A sword. Um, quite heavy.

Three of them. Three of them. That's quite heavy.

You're so gracious. Um, I'm just gonna put these down right here. I'll come back for them later, I promise.

[Speaker 2]
I can- I still have space to hold them.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't have those. I can't have those. I'm tiny.

[Speaker 2]
All right, you can give them back. I shall give it to you as thanks later.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, just hold them for me.

[Speaker 2]
All right, on we go.

[Speaker 4]
We have an alchemist in the party, right? Yes. Who's the alchemist?

It's, uh, Hooch. Hooch. Hooch.

Where's Hooch? Oh, Hooch is buried. Holy shit.

Um, so I- I don't actually know how to use this arsenic, and you're an alchemist and it says it's alchemical. Um, would you like this arsenic? Because I can also put it on my bows and shit, but, um, I figured the alchemist might want something.

[Speaker 5]
Is the alchemist muted?

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, hello? Yep, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Would you like some arsenic?

[Speaker 6]
I do have some arsenic already, but I will take more.

[Speaker 4]
Here, I'll give you- I'll give you one. Um, how do I- how do I only give you one?

[Speaker 3]
Um, when you drag it over, it should come up with a thing where you can enter just one.

[Speaker 4]
Giveth item. There you go, friend. Giveth- You gave it to the wrong lad.

Pocket. You're supposed to pull some arsenic out, chance it to you.

[Speaker 7]
You gave it to Monk, not Hooch.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, did I? Oh, they're on top of each other. Damn it.

Monk! Haha, it's mine now! Get off of it!

[Speaker 6]
It's still being placed, yay. I'm not sure that's- I think I'm locked. I don't- there I am.

[Speaker 2]
Zaras, now- now don't move. Oh, you're burdened.

[Speaker 6]
It might have been the 13 darts I gave you.

[Speaker 2]
It's just speaking things into people's pockets. It's gift as thanks! Yes, yes I am.

I- I took them off the, uh, I took them off the misfits. My pockets became too heavy and I'm like, you know who likes darts? Hooch.

[Speaker 6]
Hooch likes blue darts.

[Speaker 2]
How long we go? Unless, uh, other people need to, um, heal and things.

[Speaker 5]
Unkindly, I got hit and I'm fine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Ah, it's good to go. Hooch is, uh, fine and healthy.

Um, do you- do you need- do you need some healing now? Uh, a little bit.

[Speaker 3]
But- How long are we spending here?

[Speaker 6]
They've probably- Cla- Ctrl-Clap-A.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, um, I'm just gonna- I'm gonna hide in this corn- uh, in this- there's no corners in the circle room. Um, I'm just gonna, uh, stealth. And pull my daggers out because I'm short- short on- health one, health two.

All right. Uh-oh, and stealth. Oh right, I'm gonna ask- forget that.

I don't want to do that. I want to ask my, um, Shadow some questions.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm listening by the way.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, does anyone else have any questions that I should ask the Shadow?

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Hera will assist you asking the Shadow.

[Speaker 6]
Um, who wants to know what it tastes like?

[Speaker 4]
Probably like air. Um, I don't- I know it probably has information that we need, but I don't know what to ask it.

[Speaker 2]
Um, we are looking for a way to revive our friend, right? Oh yes, we are. So we needed to get to the basement, I believe, because there was something- um, the lady of the house was there, and the friendly Fae at the beginning said if we go there, we might be able to get our friend back.

So, how do we get to that basement?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we'll ask that.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, you must see the maid of Windmere loves to- loves to set traps. The three spiders were set up, so somebody would have to, uh, would have to explore more of the dungeon in order to acquire them, and then bring them to the- bring them to the entrance. It's smack in the middle of this basement.

Uh, open doorway that goes out to a small glade. It's, uh, behind Castle Windmere. What happens is if you- if you bring all three spiders there, then they entrap or ensnare the soul of one of your companions who's fallen.

In this case, that seems to be what you're going for. Nothing of a happy accident.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, Mr. Shade. So, how many spider corpses do we have on us right now?

[Speaker 5]
Just one.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Well, on we go to search for more spider corpses.

[Speaker 3]
Anyone have detect spiders?

[Speaker 1]
You should know, it's not really a corpse, it's like a- it's like a crafted thing.

[Speaker 4]
I can talk to spiders. So if we see any really tiny ones- Yeah, there's plenty of them around. Oh, uh, what am I asking it?

[Speaker 3]
If there's any bigger ones?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. That we can fight, yeah. Uh, you.

He's gonna, like, get on its level, you know, lay on the ground, look right in his little eyes. Um, can you help us find big spiders?

[Speaker 1]
Are you, uh- That looks something like this.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, he's literally just getting on the floor and talking to it. Um, he's got, uh, he's got a thing because of his race or whatever, ancestry.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 5]
Like, see, sprats can talk to insects. They can use diplomacy to make an impression on a request from insects.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, pretty boy!

[Speaker 3]
Oh. There's plenty of them around!

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I, uh, big, big spiders. Yeah!

[Speaker 6]
Maybe, like, the legs the size of this one when she says big, big spiders. And I wave the spider at her, and she's like, get me.

[Speaker 1]
There's one in that room over to the right!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's quite useful. Uh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Past all the leaves!

[Speaker 4]
Past all the leaves. All right, I can work with that. Thank you.

No problem!

[Speaker 1]
And he goes about his way.

[Speaker 4]
All right, well, I guess we should go about our way, too. Oops.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I've been- Before you is a room covered in leaves.

[Speaker 4]
All right, there's a spider to the one on the right, I believe you said.

[Speaker 1]
At the very back, there is, in fact, a spider.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, don't forget about the candy! The magical candy told us of the traps!

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for the reminder, friend! I had a couple- I don't care for traps! Come here, spider!

We all care for traps! Oh, well, I'm standing far back, because I remembered what happened last time.

[Speaker 5]
How many traps do I trigger walking up to the spider and grabbing it? Don't forget, we have a special bond! We've shared candy together!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, right in the middle. I'm gonna put you right- Ah!

[Speaker 2]
Whoa! Nova, holy shit, where'd you go? Nova, we warned you about this!

[Speaker 1]
Everybody add yourselves to the end!

[Speaker 3]
Nova clips through the wall!

[Speaker 5]
I haven't seen shit now.

[Speaker 1]
Now, everybody take a quick 10-minute break. Very quick.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no! Lostest 10 minutes there's ever been.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, by the way, Hooch, well, during this break, Manaia most definitely thinks you have a friend now, so... People who share weird mint together stay together.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
I've heard that phrase before.

[Speaker 2]
Really?

[Speaker 6]
I have a weird history of sharing mint with people?

[Speaker 3]
I was mainly poking at wind mimosa and, um... Oh, we shared the fungi.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right, yes! The mental- yes, yes, that is true. Yep.

[Speaker 3]
We may not be the closest old friends. Yes, of sorts.

[Speaker 2]
You were, if I recall correctly, Mimosa was yelling most of the time, though.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so... I'm blanking on your characters. Dr. Basha, just kidding. Um, one of our characters, whatever, um, got infected by a fungi that meant- that linked them mentally? And it was growing in them.

[Speaker 1]
But they began each other's thoughts. It's gonna be so good. Oh, no!

Nothing even had like, just freaked you guys out so much.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, well, Mimosa's a wee bit of a germaphobe, and she got implanted with fungi.

[Speaker 1]
This one's not a, you know, not a proper bacteria, that's more of a, uh, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Parasite. The doctor was simply- didn't want his thoughts broadcasted to two other people.

[Speaker 4]
Valid. I have intrusive thoughts. Especially if they're being broadcasted, they'd be horrible.

[Speaker 1]
In this game, I could actually make use of that to be...

[Speaker 2]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 4]
Like, oh my god, people are reading my mind. Definitely don't think of the worst things possible.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, during that time, it was because, you know, this was before he had befriended like, anyone. Well, befriended, sort of. So he wasn't too sure how people would take the whole hunting for his past subject thing.

But, you know, when people would chill with it, he was like, oh, all right then. So if it happened now, I think he would be less concerned about the thought aspect, and more the, ah, this fungus. I think Mimosa would commit a murder.

[Speaker 3]
If it happened.

[Speaker 2]
This didn't happen in the Hidden Bluff. This was a different cave, right? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
This was looking pretty...

[Speaker 2]
It's on our way to get the stars, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't remember. We had to, to get rid of them, we had to hunt other things. Let's see if I can find my way for it.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I have to drop it first, that's fine.

[Speaker 7]
Uh-huh.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, here we go. I, uh, I found the report in which we got mildly infected by spores. There was a pit fiend there.

Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Whatever happened to that guy?

[Speaker 2]
Which one? The one who made a bad deal with the pit fiend?

[Speaker 1]
No, the pit fiend.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, nothing.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, time got reset before any, before any consequences could set in.

[Speaker 1]
Thank god for that.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. Our good old cabbages pit fiend.

[Speaker 1]
You guys can see a third spider. Uh, this one does have a gem on its back. Much in the same manner that the other two do.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, icky, love it. All right.

[Speaker 3]
Wow, wow, wow.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Nope, hold on a second. This guy, he's not supposed to roll that.

He's supposed to... He's supposed to roll... Stealth.

Oh, all right. Also, this room's well lit. This gentleman is currently climbing on the ceiling.

All right, and is anybody...

[Speaker 2]
Nova, Nova!

[Speaker 1]
...back, by the way?

[Speaker 5]
I'm here.

[Speaker 6]
Eyes also potentially here.

[Speaker 7]
Very good, very good.

[Speaker 1]
Now, importantly, you did not actually set the trap, Nova? Or spring the trap? Uh, there is still one inside this room.

Ah, there it is. I do want to spend an action to grapple the target. I did not want to miss.

But I did. So I'm doing some damage. I'm gonna try to...

I can't do that. I have to do my last action. Uh, speed is 40...

Well, no, not technically. Technically it's climb. It is, uh, 20.

So it's moving this way. And there is an animal that cannot open doors. Wait.

That does not help me. Never mind. It cannot open doors, and so it shall remain there.

Uh, Pixie is going to do some prep.

[Speaker 7]
8.

[Speaker 5]
That's a big spider.

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna cast utility. B. I'm not doing that.

You just get zero. All right.

[Speaker 4]
Here. Oh, boy. He's big.

That's really big. Yeah. You didn't tell me he was that big.

He's just a spider. B. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm scared. I think when you're that small, everything is just so big.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So much bigger than you, it doesn't matter.

[Speaker 4]
I guess yelling at this thing won't really fuck with it. Um, all right. Well.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hold on. Hold on. You totally can, though.

Because you can speak to me.

[Speaker 4]
What a waste of action. Can I speak to it without wasting an action?

[Speaker 1]
Uh.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly. I'm hitting him. Fair.

[Speaker 1]
Why did it say you can't hit it?

[Speaker 5]
Sarah needs to be in that square to hit it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I do, I do.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you for reminding me.

[Speaker 3]
You gotta fly up there. Uh.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, let's try again. All right. Well, that's shitty.

All right. Go on. Eat me then.

No, I don't say that. I don't say that. I do miss twice.

Um, and I moved. So. Yeah.

Good luck, guys. All right. Bring me back to- How far high?

[Speaker 3]
I'm so- I'm so tired.

[Speaker 4]
How high is it?

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna move back just so- It's like barely 10 feet up.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I can just hit it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's actually pretty cramped. I'm coming out of this ceiling trap door. All right.

[Speaker 3]
Huh. This, and then that. Did I get it?

Just give it to me. Replace my square.

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Well. Well.

[Speaker 1]
So I am.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yes. Uh.

Stoke the heart. Here you go.

[Speaker 3]
Well, see ya.

[Speaker 2]
And that was my turn.

[Speaker 5]
What's the dog doing?

[Speaker 1]
The dog is going to delay its turn till after- The dog whines and paws at the door. Yes, which means we have a witch.

[Speaker 6]
Whoa. So in here, I see that, I'm like, ah! And I, uh, I'll use some quick alchemy.

And I'll make some fire. Fire, fire, fire. And then I'll throw it at him.

Make sure I'm targeting him so I roll correctly. Oh, it looks like a hit. It do.

And then I'm going to quick alchemy again. And I'm going to make some acid this time. And then I am going to throw it also at him.

But miss. Can I hero point that? Uh, since that's under a 10, do I get to add plus some to it?

[Speaker 5]
And that is my turn. I'm not sure how the bonus works.

[Speaker 2]
Did you reroll with a hero point or did you simply reroll it?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, he did.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, never mind then.

[Speaker 6]
And that is my turn.

[Speaker 2]
I see the issue. It's multi-attack penalty was applied to it.

[Speaker 3]
That's because it's a multi-attack penalty.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so he would have missed.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. But should the 9 not get buffed to a 19?

[Speaker 3]
Um, so the the plus 10 rule is actually not going to be on Nethys because that's, um, that's a homebrew rule that someone used that, uh, made it into Foundry. And Foundry has like an automation for it.

[Speaker 2]
Also, he rolled a 14. He rolled a 14, but, um, they made it an 18, but multi-attack penalty is applied to it. Multi-attack made it 13.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. What? No.

The multi-attack penalty is the minus 5 that are applied on the 18. It basically like removed the trained, so it made it 4 rather than... Ah.

Yeah, it just, it's a coincidence that they're 5 apart.

[Speaker 1]
He's gonna move up there.

[Speaker 5]
Open the door.

[Speaker 1]
Chill. And this guy can move very quickly. Hello, Bugs.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hey, what's up?

[Speaker 1]
Nova!

[Speaker 5]
Um, I'm gonna hit this thing. Uh, actually my first action I'll use my style of transformation to become Supernova. Uh, replay.

Oh, it automatically went to my sword. With my second action I'll attack the big guy. They crit.

My last action, I will heal for half of that.

[Speaker 1]
Amazing.

[Speaker 5]
The brink. I haven't seen that before.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, it's weird. It says 0.7 hit points.

[Speaker 5]
What?

[Speaker 1]
I'm lying. It says, it says 1. It says literally 1.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's... Okay, well that's my finished bear. Ah, there's more dogs.

[Speaker 1]
There's more dogs!

[Speaker 3]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 1]
You drowning dogs. Kara, make me a fortitude save. Pretty please.

Otter!

[Speaker 3]
I'm rolling it.

[Speaker 1]
Otter! You make it. I've rolled it.

[Speaker 3]
These are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.

[Speaker 1]
They'll be scaled up chihuahua.

[Speaker 2]
Are those not hyenas?

[Speaker 1]
Look at this fucking ugly ass.

[Speaker 3]
I love the implication of the eyes bulging out if you scale up a chihuahua. That's the only applehead a chihuahua was.

[Speaker 5]
The brain's too big for its skull.

[Speaker 1]
Kara.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well I don't like this thing, so I'm going to blink my halo. And blind it. Um...

Shit, I should have done that. Um... I don't want to kill that spider.

So... I think I'm gonna daze the spider. The spider needs to roll a will save.

[Speaker 1]
Spider will not.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, is it dumb?

[Speaker 1]
He failed.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
He is dumb.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so what happens?

[Speaker 3]
Um... I mean, does it...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, non-lethal!

[Speaker 3]
It is non-lethal, so the spider gets knocked out.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like we should just leave it instead of killing it. Maybe that'll spare some kind of wrath from the person that owns this place if we don't kill their most special prized spider.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we're supposed to take the spider though somewhere, right?

[Speaker 1]
You are supposed to take it somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
Monk will grab one of its legs and turn it. Oh wait, no never mind, we're still gonna knock that. Yep.

There's Orbeez.

[Speaker 1]
Yum.

[Speaker 3]
All right, um, that is all three of my actions, so that is me.

[Speaker 1]
Is it so dead? It's turn, pixie. But which pixie?

This one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, um, that last one bit me, right?

[Speaker 1]
That is correct.

[Speaker 3]
Blood Vendetta.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no. Yes! Oh god, she takes that.

[Speaker 3]
Did it roll its, uh, will save?

[Speaker 1]
I just applied the damage to it, uh, it did fail.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it critically failed. So it takes double that.

[Speaker 5]
No, it applies it at the end of its turn. It's got 4d6 persistent bleed.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is what I need to do.

[Speaker 5]
Anyway.

[Speaker 1]
I missed! Fucking bullshit. All right, regular attack.

Oh, of course.

[Speaker 4]
All right. All right, um, dog, spider's knocked out. All right, uh, I can't move.

There we go. Dog, work with me here. Okay, this is a little bit difficult because I have to be in his...

This is such an infuriating fucking rule. I can't click on my dude.

[Speaker 3]
Um, you should probably make yourself, like, slightly higher so that you can be...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That hits.

[Speaker 7]
Just hits.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, jeez.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, was it off guard? Because I think you still have off guard clicked.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, is this guy off guard?

[Speaker 3]
Does it have any reason to be?

[Speaker 1]
I thought so.

[Speaker 3]
I can't exactly see what's going on, so.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't think it should be off guard so there wouldn't be precision damage.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a... Do you have a weapon with reach or a melee unarmed attack?

[Speaker 4]
I'm not gonna lie, I don't know what the fuck that means. Um, I just have two daggers. Do you want me to re-roll the first one?

[Speaker 1]
Nah. Okay. Five to putz back.

Oh, we're good.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, that's my go. I will intern.

[Speaker 1]
Monk.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to drink some wine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're targeting hooch? Oh, that's hooch? My bad.

[Speaker 3]
Not to say y'all look alike. Okay, wood. Okay, this one then.

The 26 and the 9.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 26 would be a critical hit actually, so I'm gonna undo that damage. Hold on. So go ahead and roll.

It's right there.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry. Um, she looks terrible. Monk's gonna point at Para.

And that's his turn.

[Speaker 1]
Para's looking pretty bad. But I am. Oh, I didn't even see you there.

[Speaker 2]
Thank god. Do you know how thankful I was that you were targeting Para, not me? Good lord.

[Speaker 3]
I thought you were- Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
At first I thought you were doing it to be nice, but now I know you just didn't see me. Okay. Well, I'm going to recast Stoke the Heart.

I'm still going to put the, um, you know, the nice attack bonus on Nova. But I'm putting the restored spirit effect on Para so she doesn't die. And, um, I will also cast Bless just to make life a little easier for everyone.

And then I'll cast Shield, so I- Um, I don't think you can do...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you would have to- Oh, wait, no, it's two!

[Speaker 2]
Ah, it's two actions, not three. Whoopsie daisy. I'll take that back.

Nothing happens. Uh, so I'll keep Bless up, though. Okay, I did it, I did it, I did it.

[Speaker 3]
And that will be my turn. Did you drag the aura onto yourself? Oh, yes, why?

There we go. I think you dragged it onto me.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Put yourself plus one so that you're above me.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god. Okay, it's just going on to you. I can't, um, hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Let me move myself out of the way. Hold on, let me move myself- And now it's gonna go on the creature. One second.

[Speaker 1]
Here we go. What is the action that you're going to do? What is the action that you're going to do with that move?

And then look back.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. And now I'm ending my- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, before I end my turn, I'm going to get my bird to heal me because, um, he remembered I existed. Two, that's fine.

Okie dokie. And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 6]
Um, I threw a bomb at the healthy person, but that missed. And I'm going to draw an acid and throw it at the doggie.

[Speaker 2]
Throw it at the doggie. Oh, sorry, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
That is a critical miss. So, I guess I'm going to focus splash only on him, too. And I'm going to...

...draw. See, I- Quick, uh, quick bomb. And then I'll also draw it at a, um, a flask of minor, um, life-giving, whatever it is. But not giving me the option to draw it, but that would be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks. Where's Minaya?

[Speaker 3]
Minaya's under the bird. What the fuck? We need to get Minaya an actual token, Border.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's rough. Here we come now, Zenova.

[Speaker 5]
Okie dokie, first action, I will... ...transcend my scar to heal a very small amount with my, uh, my root epithet, I think is how it's pronounced. I can, as part of that move, half my speed towards an enemy in a straight line.

My second action, I hit this dog. I know that one's dead. Second action, I'll stride.

I can't see if there's anything blocking me. I'm stepping to... Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, James put these doors, like, midway through a block, so we can't go through it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, because the walls aren't on there. You just have to not move diagonally.

[Speaker 3]
What? Moving straight doesn't allow us out of these, because it's not a full... We have to move diagonally.

[Speaker 1]
Right, I'm wrong, I'm very wrong.

[Speaker 5]
Um, there's too many people in the square, I'm gonna move to here. All right, so that's my second action to move to there. My last action, I'm gonna hit the top dog.

Whoops, accidentally shut the door instead of... I may as well use a hero point to reroll that one. Would that count?

[Speaker 1]
Just quickly, did that count as, like, using a move action with a guy's reach?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yes. I did trigger any attacks that... Um, I would have moved through both of their squares to get to here.

That they can attack. I'd be at 47 hit points before taking this damage. Five.

Eight. Thirteen.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want me to apply those?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I've got it.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. Uh, now I need to roll damage for my crit. 35 on the top dog.

That is my turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Heal thyself. Yeah, um...

I am gonna cast a two action heal upon myself. Okay. Um, and then that was two actions.

I have one action left. Um, with one action, I'm gonna cast shield on myself. And that is me.

Oh, it's still Nova's turn.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Save. Which is succeed. Nice.

That is his turn. Coming out to a pixie. You know what?

It's not going well. Oh, we're not... We're not with using actions still.

Zero.

[Speaker 4]
Um, turning that corner, would that be two actions?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. You sound really quiet. One more time.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, uh, I asked if turning that corner would be two actions, but someone said no. So I'm gonna take that.

[Speaker 6]
Turning corner? No.

[Speaker 1]
Target this dude.

[Speaker 4]
Come on, target. Oh, someone's scrolling. Okay, all right.

Critical miss. All right. Well, I got one hit, so.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yes. Toasty. Carbonaya.

[Speaker 2]
That's fun. Uh, I will try to attack it. If I miss, I am leaving immediately.

[Speaker 3]
Don't go too far. Oh, I guess. Yeah, you can go somewhat far, but not too far.

[Speaker 2]
I miss. He is invisible. Goodbye.

I'm taking my familiar with me. Just here. Taking my familiar and going.

Oh, wait, I can't move too far because of the- Give me a second as I just move slightly so I can get everyone in the bless effect.

[Speaker 3]
Monk is too far. It's fine, it's fine. Okay.

Well, I tried.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, I wanted to pick my bomb and throw it at the pixie, but it did not like that, and I don't think it rolled. That's why I'm trying again. Nope, failed.

So, uh, just the one splash damage. And then I'm gonna go up here, and I'm trying to dash our companion with a elixir of life. Whoops.

Will that be the end of the turn? Yeah, I just can't do the elixirs because I can't target the person.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Can you- Get that fucking bird off your token, I swear to Christ. All right, there you go.

[Speaker 6]
Do you have, like, next reset?

[Speaker 1]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
There you go. So you should be able to use that, and it should heal you. If you use it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not obliged, I'll use it on my turn.

[Speaker 6]
Can I use that? But, like, I'm using- I'm giving it to you now, so I'm like, I'm feeding it to you right now. Oh, okay, okay.

Or death, and then you're in it, you know, considering I'm tiny.

[Speaker 1]
I'm opening the door. And with that, whatever you would like to do next, I'll draw that counter as depleted.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Minaya is getting a heal.

[Speaker 1]
And Siryn also gets a double dose.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, everyone likes double dose.

[Speaker 2]
How do we add the extra 220?

[Speaker 1]
I automatically assign it to you. I automatically assign it to you.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
I'm like, uh, I don't know about you guys, but, uh, I'm writing a lot of things to start.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we might need to find a spot to, um, make camp.

[Speaker 1]
Always do it in the glades.

[Speaker 3]
We get to it. That's a lot smarter than what Mata was going to say.

[Speaker 1]
He was going to stay in his room with the spider. It's a pretty straight shot because you've got all three spiders.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, should we do?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. That big one was also the, uh, represent spiders because I thought it'd be funny if two of them were objects and one of them was a giant fuck-up.

[Speaker 7]
That is pretty funny.

[Speaker 3]
So if we have everything, we can just look to the glade.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't hear that.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. I know.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't even hear the last part of that sentence. Whoa, you're hitting me with the doppler.

[Speaker 3]
I am so tired.

[Speaker 1]
I feel you.

[Speaker 3]
It's fine.

[Speaker 6]
Since people are thinking, are we taunt here? Are we going to keep going?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I'm going to call it here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we're going to. Yeah, I mean, I guess we can get to the glade at least.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're going to get to the glade, you're going to meet the lady, Lady Windmeyer. Oh, there we go. That didn't load.

That's fine. It doesn't matter. We're not going to see this map again for a while.

Certainly not this iteration of it. Oh, that's one other thing. There was a, uh, there was no spider cocoon in the...

I'm going to move everybody back. Why did I do that? Control Z.

Oh my god. I tried doing that. It didn't work.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we're almost there. Oh my god, that's a lot of copper.

[Speaker 1]
Also, the pixie had a, uh, rune of striking on her. Oh, wait, no, you didn't. Uh, she's alive.

Never mind. Now, basically, the Lady Windmeyer will offer to bring back a clink as a reward for testing. Testing on her dungeon.

[Speaker 3]
Like, fully? Or as a ghost?

[Speaker 1]
As a ghost. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Not if it goes to hug clink and just goes through it.

[Speaker 3]
No, go... These ghosts are corporeal.

[Speaker 1]
And then we have...

[Speaker 5]
I think I saw the...

[Speaker 1]
...things like fetters and stuff like that, but we could do that later. Yeah. I will be...

I'm listening. I will be back. I just...

I gotta use the restroom.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
It's time to, I guess, divide and, um, all the gold and stuff?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, let's look around for that.

[Speaker 5]
Did we get any more gold?

[Speaker 3]
Um, there's the copper that's in the spider repository.

[Speaker 5]
Oh boy, copper.

[Speaker 3]
Two thousand three hundred and nine. James could do the cool thing and just have it automatically, um, divvy out. In there.

[Speaker 5]
We all get, um, seven gold and six silver from the, uh, other bits.

[Speaker 2]
Our dear alchemist could probably use the alchemical chart.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Who wants the mysterious charter of conquest? Whatever that one is. Quint does!

Quint does! Oh, give it to him!

[Speaker 2]
He'll go use it on his pack. You said seven gold and six silver for the other divvy?

[Speaker 5]
That was the gold that I tallied up. The gold that I tallied up.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Seven gold, six silver.

[Speaker 4]
When I pick a skill feat, do I need to select any traits? Like rogue or barrier?

[Speaker 3]
Um, skill feat is separate from... General feats. From class feats.

So you don't need to select anything except for the skill that you're using.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Is the copper being divvied up or can I steal it?

[Speaker 3]
I... It's being divvied up. Yeah, there's an easy way for James to divvy it up.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, would you like your shortswords now? Oh, um...

[Speaker 4]
Sure, actually, yes. I... They will be wonderful additions to Quint's coin purse.

Splendid. Oh, there's a what's that up your sleeve, uh, feat or skill that, um, gives you gambling lore and you fought cheaters. That's awesome.

I think... I think I'm gonna have a downtime thing where I just... I gamble for money.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, and you have your marked cards which should give you a plus one.

[Speaker 4]
I think I could do something really special here. Or I could become a tattoo artist. You need a tattoo?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, Franca. Uh, Franca. Hm?

Sir Yolan's hubris in the party sheet. I think that...

[Speaker 5]
It's a really...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the only one.

[Speaker 4]
I got a lot of stuff this, uh, throughout this thing.

[Speaker 2]
You know, the dueling cap, is that just the matador cape? You know, the people who like duel bulls and stuff?

[Speaker 3]
Possible.

[Speaker 4]
I really only got the scarf and some arsenic. Um, what is this? Sir Yolan's...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I read the whole description. It is just a bulls cape. That's why you have feint and AC bonus.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I didn't really... It's already been... I don't know if, um, you're gonna have Cirrus do a lot of feinting, but...

What does feint do? Click the button. Yeah, reading it now.

Feint, you roll a deception, and then they become off-guard to you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I actually have a feat for that, for this character. Well then, there you go.

[Speaker 3]
You get a plus one to it. All right, I'll take it. I'll take it.

Well, you get a plus one to AC anyway. And then you also get one.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone want the animal allies thing, or may I take it?

[Speaker 3]
I don't need it. I don't need it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Anyone else?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, I can't use it, so...

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Yonk.

[Speaker 6]
What kind of weird scientist was using this chart on this spider?

[Speaker 4]
Underground network? Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so doing the math on the copper. Rounding up, we'll each get 385 pieces of copper. So just add 385 copper pieces to your inventories, and then I'll just delete it off the spider repository.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, how much?

[Speaker 3]
385. You're making us do math? No, no!

[Speaker 4]
I'm just telling you the answer! Yes, they already did the math.

[Speaker 3]
It's more math than my brain can handle right now.

[Speaker 4]
Has everyone...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, good night. Has everyone added their stuff? Yes.

Yes. Splendid, I shall delete it then. Somehow...

Wait, hang on. If I give it to my thing, it should delete itself.

[Speaker 3]
Nope, that did not work.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I guess it stays in there.

[Speaker 3]
I am also gonna go eat, but I'm gonna move, um, Hera out. Oh, the thing. Oh, look at it.

Oh, look at it. Skilled. Here, that should delete the copper.

[Speaker 4]
Good night!

[Speaker 2]
See ya. Good night.

[Speaker 4]
Good night.

[Speaker 2]
It is like 7am, so I'm going to sleep.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wow. Goodbye. Goodbye.

[Speaker 5]
See ya.

[Speaker 4]
See ya.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that would be fun. Confabulator. Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie.

Reduce them circumstance bonus. A target gains for your previous attempts to create a diversion or lie to it. From a 4 to a 2.

I think that'd be really funny if he just rambled on after being caught in a lie. Just adding more. He does not have a good charisma.

[Speaker 5]
It's a good feat in very niche circumstances.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heck. I think I might go with underground network.

Nah. Actually, wary disarmament. Disarmament might work if you trigger a device or set off a trap while disarming it.

You gain a plus 2 circumstance bonus to your AC. Or saving throw against it. I'm going to be doing all the...

[Speaker 5]
Some of the skill feats have prerequisites that you might not have.

[Speaker 4]
I have expert. Do I have expert in Daybreak? Are you sure I have expert?

I'm trained. I don't have expert. Uh.

What to do then? I don't have gambling. Do I have expert in...

Absolutely. No.

[Speaker 6]
I know there's a... Because a rogue gets a bonus to level 2, like for a train. And so there's lots of expert things there, but otherwise it throws you off.

[Speaker 4]
You know what? Maybe I should look up rogue... Rogue leveling.

[Speaker 5]
At level 2 you get a rogue feat, a skill feat, a skill increase, and a archetype feat. You can do your um... Skill increase before taking a feat as well.

Okay. So you could put society to expert, for example. If you're trained in it.

[Speaker 4]
I think I'll... Oh, I should either do stealth or thievery. Stealth probably?

[Speaker 5]
They're both good choices.

[Speaker 4]
You can also get skill training as a thingy. I think that might be my best bet. Does that give me like a few extra?

I'll get in the skill of my choice. Skill training. Deception.

Perfecto. I now have a plus 4 in deception. All right, I think that's that's it.

Good night, you guys. Oh wait, hold on. How much gold was I supposed to take?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, 7.6 gold and then... So 7 gold, 6 silver, and 300 and...

[Speaker 4]
385 copper.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Alrighty, well, good night you guys.

[Speaker 6]
See ya. Good night.

[Speaker 5]
I am going to head off now. Catch y'all later.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, catch yous too.

[Speaker 5]
See ya. you

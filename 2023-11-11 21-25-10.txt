[Speaker 6]
That's totally a lie.

[Speaker 1]
That is a lie. Alright, second day.

[Speaker 5]
Will you stop saying that? What?

[Speaker 1]
The result is public.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, but it makes me feel paranoid.

[Speaker 2]
Hi.

[Speaker 1]
Day two is on this side. Oh, I can't like... I'll drive it.

That's fine.

[Speaker 2]
I will admit, I am kind of happy it's an all ladies session. It is.

[Speaker 3]
It is.

[Speaker 5]
All ladies and James.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I mean, that's how it always is.

[Speaker 5]
But I meant players.

[Speaker 2]
It's always a bunch of fun and nonsense.

[Speaker 3]
And always a little bit chaotic.

[Speaker 4]
We love chaos. We thrive in chaos.

[Speaker 2]
I definitely do. No, you're not teasing him.

[Speaker 1]
The Lay Adepts, so you guys have what is it? You have two groups of forgers, I believe. And one of...

here. Alchemists, forgers, Lay Adepts and you have a VIP priest that's been coming along for these.

[Speaker 6]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
As well as a team of researchers, I think it is.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
What is it? Five wagons? Plus the supply wagons.

Oh, wow. I guess about six. Oh, seven.

The researchers have brought learning from their earlier caravan journey and some of the things that happened there, they have brought a cage wagon that can be used as a prison or as a cage for a particularly large creature.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
That's a big creature. Can my elephant have come along, too?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah! It's a giant elephant. You could have...

Bix came on the airship, but you could have brought Bix's elephant along, too, if you want to.

[Speaker 1]
We also have an elephant.

[Speaker 2]
His name is Harry Elephante.

[Speaker 1]
An ironically good cavern guard. Look, if enemies see really big creatures following along, they're, generally speaking, not going to attack. It's going to dissuade them.

[Speaker 6]
Wow. I would not mess with anyone.

[Speaker 5]
I can do Vanguard.

[Speaker 1]
Bix, you notice occasionally when you turn back, it looks like you see moving trees. You guys have been going for about... Let's see here.

This is day two, so you guys have gone a total of 96 miles. You're going at two hexes per day. On account of the pleasant weather.

[Speaker 2]
And we're all by the forest. So they've been following us. We're being stalked by a bunch of trees.

[Speaker 1]
We're, in fact, being stalked by a bunch of trees.

[Speaker 6]
Our TV doesn't like it.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like we should offer them something if we're all going to be moving together. But what would a tree want?

[Speaker 5]
Blood.

[Speaker 2]
I was going to say water, but blood probably also with these ones.

[Speaker 1]
Interesting.

[Speaker 5]
When are these troll playing with that being interesting?

[Speaker 1]
They're always interesting because I made them. That's the easiest part. I made them to be interesting.

You guys come across a patch of explosive mushrooms.

[Speaker 5]
Oh! That is pretty interesting.

[Speaker 1]
See?

[Speaker 5]
If the trees get too close, we can just throw them at them.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa has this filter where she's like, I could send that to my ex-husband. No, no. No, no, no.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the caravan comes across a spot where the trail just seems to end. It just kind of seems to dissipate into a clearing next to some sheer cliff walls. Basically, this is a pretty common feature across the valley, a mesa.

[Speaker 5]
Can I roll to harvest some of those mushrooms?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can. I guess Pix is an herbalist, so go ahead and roll me a survival check. If you succeed, you'll get an additional mushroom.

[Speaker 5]
Can I do sleight of hand?

[Speaker 1]
That also works. Perfect. Alright, so you get two mushrooms instead of one.

[Speaker 5]
Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
This is a wonderful place to set up camp, by the way. Very pretty.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. Para, your little golden plate that you've received from Corrigan begins glowing at this place.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. I'm gonna pick up a rock and put it in my bag.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so which party would like- I guess it doesn't matter too much. You guys are going around anyways. Which way would you like to go around?

North or south?

[Speaker 4]
North? Because that's forward. And south is backwards.

[Speaker 5]
Where are we on the map?

[Speaker 1]
I've just put that little blue line Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, are we at this little sun- are we at the end of this little sun place?

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I've ever been to one of these.

[Speaker 6]
Did I hear parties go north?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sun shrine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're at a sun shrine. We need to figure out if we want to go on the north side of the mountain area or- It would be less time to go to the south.

[Speaker 4]
Probably.

[Speaker 2]
We need to go through the desert. I assume that's a desert. A mesa, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. That'd be interesting. We've never had one of those before.

Alright, we go south.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the northern place kind of looks like it's it's dividing us to where we have to go in between these two bodies of water, which makes me nervous.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
What does that make the cat person nervous?

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. I was just thinking of how many times the mouse has been dragged away in the water.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the pleasant weather has ended. Actually, there is something new.

[Speaker 5]
Nope, surprise! It's more pleasant weather.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty! And so it was.

[Speaker 5]
I'm a prophet.

[Speaker 3]
That's okay. If it gets too bad, I also have control weather.

[Speaker 1]
What does that mean? What does a CR 15 plus creature draw? Oh boy.

[Speaker 4]
What is CR 15?

[Speaker 1]
There's a lot in that range.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
What isn't in CR 15?

[Speaker 5]
Let's hope for 15 CR 1s. Does 15 CR 1s equal a CR 15?

[Speaker 6]
15?

[Speaker 1]
That's it. Scanlan Shorthalt is CR 15.

[Speaker 6]
So many options.

[Speaker 4]
Just one. We have elephants.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have elephants? Oh, I know what that is. That's CR 20.

It's supposed to be 15 plus. It's not supposed to be 20 plus.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
I think I know what to go with. Just give me a quick five minutes to go over this because there's a bunch of options. What I thought would be the obvious one does not apply here.

[Speaker 4]
That's how I feel as a druid.

[Speaker 1]
Huge moon. Let's filter to make sure I'm not going with...

[Speaker 6]
... ...

[Speaker 1]
... ...

[Speaker 6]
It's going to make me reload again. That's annoying. ...

There we go. All right. Come back in.

[Speaker 1]
My importer is not working. While you guys are moving along, you come across an area that has a rough, pretty neat riverside. A bunch of small lakes and ponds in this area kind of seeping up from cracks in the ground.

Lots of spring water here coming up in semi-unnatural formations where it's just like a sheet basically of water coming out of the ground.

[Speaker 4]
Warm waters.

[Speaker 1]
And a lot of your forgers go out on these sort of improvised canoes and some of them even take logs out. And after... ...

... ... ...

... ...

[Speaker 4]
...

[Speaker 1]
... ...

[Speaker 2]
...

[Speaker 6]
...

[Speaker 4]
... ... ...

... ...

[Speaker 2]
...

[Speaker 1]
... ... ...

... ... ...

... ...

[Speaker 4]
... ...

[Speaker 2]
... ... ...

[Speaker 5]
...

[Speaker 4]
... ...

[Speaker 1]
... ...

[Speaker 4]
... ... ...

[Speaker 3]
... Para.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
I would like to locate creature.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I rolled perception to kind of search the area. Sounds good.

You start canvassing. Let's see here. Para, as you're walking along, Fix points out to you a spot of what looks to be recently carved wood that's been shattered.

It looks like an unnatural collection of wood and such that's just been deposited or left floating on the surface. And as you get closer, you get a ping for underneath the water.

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Or billows in the starting.

[Speaker 6]
Huh.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
All right, Para's gonna let them know. And gosh, I do.

[Speaker 2]
Under the water? Under the surface of the water?

[Speaker 6]
That's correct. Under the sea. Oh boy.

[Speaker 5]
Under the sea.

[Speaker 6]
All right. Sea, under the sea.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was gonna see if I had like a water breathing spell, but I don't think I do. I doubt the children did either. So Para's just gonna- Para's standing right behind you.

[Speaker 2]
Hold her breath. Yeah, Para's gonna say I'm counting down to when Mimosa goes and she's just gonna go.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Para's gonna go. If she doesn't have a water breathing, she would have just jumped in anyway.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me another perception check.

[Speaker 3]
Bix or Para and Mimosa?

[Speaker 1]
Para and Mimosa. I think they were in the water.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, well, Bix will jump in too. After probably turning into a sea elf or a mermaid or something. PB's not enrolled in that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we pat PB on the head and jump in.

[Speaker 4]
If you guys are gone for too long, she'll come around.

[Speaker 1]
There's what looks to be a large air bubble under there with a little bit of light coming under it.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I go.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. I don't think that you have the constitution to dive that far down. So?

[Speaker 2]
Get down there one way or another. I go find a heavy rock.

[Speaker 1]
So they think the idea of the- so constitution, what is it? I think you hold your breath for a number of minutes up to your constitution modifier. It's pretty generous to begin with.

[Speaker 5]
I've got three. I've got a plus three. I have two.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's pretty good. Plus three. PB, you standing on the surface watch as a very large ripple.

Kind of like- you ever kick while you're under the water and watch the ripple just kind of like form out from it? Yeah. Kind of looks like that, except it produces a wave.

[Speaker 5]
Oh boy. That's not at all ominous.

[Speaker 4]
PB's gonna start pacing and hyping herself up, trying to get her- get herself more confident.

[Speaker 1]
And then she comes over and gives you a potion of water breathing.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, oh, oh, she downs it.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 6]
And then she dives in.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. PB, you see the tail end of a large, very, very large, huge, some might even say shelled creature sweeping downwards towards a barely lit bubble of air.

[Speaker 4]
Um, how does it- what does it sound like when you scream underwater?

[Speaker 6]
Water! That's what you hear.

[Speaker 4]
Um, uh, let's see. I have four javelins that I could just start swimming with in that direction. Okay.

I'm assuming whatever this creature is is not friendly because it's going towards them.

[Speaker 6]
Nothing's friendly.

[Speaker 1]
It has currently attempted to sweep up Paramimosa and Bix, and basically it's- if not, like, it's arms or fins, I guess, uh, slash mouth, also in its- in its wake, just kind of dragging them towards the air bubble. Well, maybe that's not so bad. You can't see them for the moment, but the three of you are deposited into a large air bubble and you see two children run over, uh, looking rather terrified.

There is a- you have tumbled out into this bubble. There is a- a huge reptilian face with a hooked top jaw looking down at you folks. Hamasa is immediately checking over the children to make sure they're all right.

[Speaker 3]
Para's gonna say hello in Draconic.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, indeed. I take it you've come to pay ransom?

[Speaker 5]
Bix is flipping their tail comingly.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Ransom?

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa- uh, Mimosa's smile will tighten and she'll turn- turn her head a little- cock her head a little bit and be like, ransom? Excuse me?

[Speaker 1]
Ransom. Ran- Ransism. Ransom.

We're kidnapped.

[Speaker 2]
Is this your first time ransoming?

[Speaker 1]
Kidnapped kids?

[Speaker 2]
It's okay if it is.

[Speaker 1]
No, usually I just eat.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
But this time I ransom for food.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Is- you said this was a dragon?

[Speaker 1]
It is a dragon turtle.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. That's right. You just want food?

[Speaker 5]
I have pastries and I have candies.

[Speaker 1]
I- I have a- I eat gold?

[Speaker 5]
I have a prime peppermint, would that interest you? I have- Marble berries. I have hero's feast.

At some point- That's a good idea.

[Speaker 3]
Um.

[Speaker 4]
At some point I'm sure Kiwi would- Yeah, she's gonna come in like- Jump into trouble.

[Speaker 1]
Less than a minute, basically.

[Speaker 4]
Like, big thing!

[Speaker 1]
Yes, we've met the big thing, thank you. Monster. I need monster feast.

[Speaker 5]
You could- Heroes can be- Monsters can be heroes too.

[Speaker 1]
This is ransom.

[Speaker 5]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't really seem like he knows what a hero's feast is.

[Speaker 3]
Um, Para will kind of pause and she'll be like- If you give me 10 minutes, I can have a lot of food for you.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, and she will take 10 minutes to prepare hero's feast.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. You have a bowl? With a thousand gems- Er, worth a thousand gold pieces?

Encrusted with gems? Up, up?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it has a thing on it. No, but I have a thousand- Gold worth of gems, probably. Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
I have a rotten eyeless cave koi.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Kiki gets here. Everybody make me a perception check, real quick. And Mimosa, right now the kids are talking like- We saw, we saw glittering down below.

We saw, we saw the treasure. It's in that cave that we thought that we could dive for, but we got swept in here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, it's okay. We'll get you back home. And then she'll lean in close and be like- But seriously though, don't ever do anything like this again.

Unless you're prepared.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, come on, man. But we did so much gold.

[Speaker 2]
Were you prepared this time? No, sweetie. No, you have to go when you're prepared so you can come back with the riches.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so Para, you do see that there is quite a bit of treasure over in the nearby cave. But the dragon turtle right now has its eyes locked on you. Mimosa can also see where it was pointed out.

And there are some, there are some jeweled objects in there. Bedazzled objects, if you will.

[Speaker 3]
Did I take message?

[Speaker 1]
And Vix, you can also see it. Kibu right now is distracted by the giant fucking turtle that she just jumped on top of.

[Speaker 4]
Very suspicious and angry at this thing for no apparent reason.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna tell the turtle while she is working on that, I'm gonna head back up to the surface. And talk to the family, see if they have anything to contribute to the ransom.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, good, good. I should ask for more food.

[Speaker 5]
No, you won't. And if you want me to roll deception for that, I will. Because I'm gonna stealth around behind it and see about getting a bowl from the horde.

Yeah, that sounds good. Although I think I could get advantage on that.

[Speaker 4]
I'm very much against the idea of paying ransom.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should just kill it. We can try. Mimosa's wanted to kill it since it said it was going to ransom the children, so.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
This thing does not have a turtle.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, Para will go with it if you guys attack, but.

[Speaker 4]
Is there a way we can raise the bubble? So that, like, they can not die when we bring the children out of the bubble?

[Speaker 1]
Well. Raise the bubble?

[Speaker 3]
I mean, they made it down here. Going up is usually easier. Plus, Para does have teleport.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, Para has teleport.

[Speaker 2]
I was just thinking that. You just want to teleport it out? Okay, but are we smart enough to know that Bix went off to stealth behind us?

Or do we believe that they actually went up top?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you're actually looking. I mean, you're looking in that direction right now. So you probably would notice Bix.

[Speaker 2]
While we wait. Oh, did they see Bix, though?

[Speaker 1]
No, they did not. Okay. Bix got a 24, and even though they got a natural 20, it's still just a 21.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's not Pathfinder rules here.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa will offer some tweets while they wait. Oh, no, they want gold. They don't want...

[Speaker 3]
Meat. Do you have any meats?

[Speaker 2]
I... Not in my bag of holding.

[Speaker 6]
Have you ever gotten fish?

[Speaker 2]
It's gonna go bad. I've eaten it and cooked it.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they were kids' kids, by the way. Bar.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, yeah, I got that.

[Speaker 2]
So are we waiting for Bix to come back with the bowl, or are we teleporting out of there?

[Speaker 1]
I'm waiting.

[Speaker 2]
I figured we were waiting.

[Speaker 1]
So right now, Bix, go ahead and make an investigation check. All right, 17, you'll find a bowl that seems suitable for these purposes. You may be able to take a few little objects on your way out as well.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Let's scoop some gold up.

[Speaker 5]
I will swim back over to the bubble and hand it over to Para and say, Oh, you know, the family sent this down to help you prepare the feast and also as part of the ransom.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, good, good. Excellent.

[Speaker 3]
All right. After 10 minutes, Para is able to make the feast.

[Speaker 1]
All right. The dragon turtle is very happy and very distracted with these.

[Speaker 2]
And also leaves immediately with the children.

[Speaker 1]
So the children are not going to be able to swim up. They're not going to be able to hold their breath long enough.

[Speaker 3]
That's why we can teleport up.

[Speaker 2]
We teleport up. Okay. Can you teleport with them?

Obviously.

[Speaker 3]
I can teleport up to eight willing creatures, so.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 1]
All right. And I dropped some of the gold that Bix was able to just scoop up while they were hanging out.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I got to go and lock my door. I'll be right back.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, she's up. I'll be right back too.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. Guys can take a moment. Families are very happy.

[Speaker 5]
I'm here. I'm always here. Bix is quite enjoying being a ridiculous little mermaid.

Their tail is purple and sparkly. It's possible they're wearing a little seashell bra.

[Speaker 1]
The deceiver's lingerie. Yeah, Mosa has one of those.

[Speaker 3]
All right, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I did not need to open all those. Oops.

[Speaker 1]
There, save that there. Perfect. And I am going to- Oh, Bix, while you were there, you also noticed some activity or some offerings that looked a little bit- that looked handcrafted and recent.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Like armor fashioned out of clamshells or shields.

[Speaker 5]
So somebody in the area is worshiping this dragon turtle. Or at least friends.

[Speaker 6]
Very interesting.

[Speaker 1]
With that, does the party want to move on?

[Speaker 6]
Yep. I would say so.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, one more until you guys actually reach the search area. I'll take a very short break so I can go grab... Wait, no I don't.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, he gets.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, did you hear the noise? Yes, you did.

[Speaker 1]
That's fun.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, marmy agent.

[Speaker 4]
I'm assuming I've paid my debt by now. Um, Kara says.

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Oh, probably.

[Speaker 1]
Kara sort of been able to pay it with the money that she got last evening.

[Speaker 3]
I bet.

[Speaker 1]
It reminds me, I was expecting you guys to like harvest those T-Rexes. The what? The T-Rexes.

[Speaker 5]
I completely forgot about that.

[Speaker 1]
There were- Oh, wait, no, that was Bar. I fought the T-Rexes with everybody else.

[Speaker 5]
Dinosaurs? And I went in there intending to harvest some dragon stuff. Gotta find that dragon.

So I just found myself.

[Speaker 3]
Little mister, you're getting real chunky. Yes, you are. I don't think it's chunk.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's do lake foraging.

[Speaker 5]
Somebody decided to go the way that didn't have the lakes.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you guys are adjacent to those lakes.

[Speaker 3]
I think there's some lakes that are here that aren't shown on the map.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Because I think we're down here.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are... Yeah, we're right here.

[Speaker 3]
We went around the Shrine of Sun. What are sun shrines? What are they?

Mm-hmm. Um, as far as I can tell, they're just like shrines to an old sun god that we don't know the name of. And, um, we were activating them pretty heavily when I first started here.

Um, and it was basically like pushing back the frost.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. So we need to do that more.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and then the frost kind of stopped for a while and now I guess it's been picking back up. So we should probably go and reactivate a few of them. But yeah.

[Speaker 5]
So the person in charge... Also, we have also gotten some news about Zephain's seals. So we have another way to fight the frost other than just...

[Speaker 3]
Yes. That was just kind of like the first one. So what happens if we kill him?

[Speaker 4]
You know, just get rid of the person doing all the frost stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Presumably it disappears.

[Speaker 5]
No repercussions? Yeah, but only until there's another one. I'm gonna kill that one too.

[Speaker 6]
Very reasonable.

[Speaker 2]
There is someone who will probably replace Zephain immediately if we kill him.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, power vacuum.

[Speaker 2]
Could make an order, like a sacred order. I've been chatting with her in the RB channel.

[Speaker 5]
I thought you were gonna say an orgy for a second.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, we could do that too.

[Speaker 5]
I mean... We're gonna fight the frost with the power of an orgy to keep warm. Exactly.

That's what snakes do.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to go get some eggnog and you can decide... You guys have reached the search area. You could decide where it is that you're going to...

[Speaker 6]
Right there.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, what was the specific thing Nessie got from that? Do you remember the thing that Sol said to Mimosa? Mimosa.

[Speaker 1]
What specifically are you referring to?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I was asking Nessie.

[Speaker 2]
I figured she would know.

[Speaker 3]
She had gotten some more specific directions, I feel like.

[Speaker 2]
By the map.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I think the map is what took you here. I thought it was between mountains or something like that that he was saying. The more flowery, specific language.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I want to say, but I don't remember.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I just thought maybe you might remember it.

[Speaker 2]
It's been a while. A lot's happened. Yeah, I could've sworn he was like, Where's your coordinates?

Like, pinpointed where it was.

[Speaker 3]
Nested between two mountains.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my burrito is here.

[Speaker 3]
That is so much excitement for a burrito.

[Speaker 1]
Skip. Already? So, where does the party want to go exactly?

[Speaker 3]
I think she was saying, like, over in this area? In this area? In this area?

That seems like a pretty good place to start. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Morph, morph, morph, morph.

[Speaker 1]
In this area, there does seem to be a little bit more, like, actual roads. And not just, like, trails. Like, they're going through random places in the woods or having to be forded.

The lake keepers have been doing a pretty good job. Asking ley lines and praying, basically, for the trees to clear. Making small offerings to them.

And it's been, it's been going pretty well.

[Speaker 4]
What did I miss? Huh? What's going on?

[Speaker 1]
Sunday. At the research area.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Quick save note. All right, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Someone leave?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Zianna was in here for a bit.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
How neat.

[Speaker 2]
Are we looking for the tower? Is that what we're doing right now?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Okay. What was I describing?

Oh, the, uh, so yes. The lake keepers have basically been the only reason you guys have been able to ford a path through here for the moment. But once you get to this, start getting to this area, there's more, like, actual roads that seem to crisscross the sort of random villages around.

You'll stop at a village at your first day or some of the caravans to, like, offload their goods. A lot of the foragers and trappers have been foraging and trapping and collecting a lot of goods that the townsfolk can use. Local alchemists brew some potions for minor ailments, a few healing potions.

And the lake keepers are drinking a lot.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. How many days would you have said this was?

[Speaker 1]
This was a total of five days because you guys were going about two days per day. Okay. Nice.

[Speaker 4]
Shouldn't be too hard to find a tall tower.

[Speaker 1]
The town alderman comes up to the group, or sort of introduces himself as Zacharias. Hi, hi, this is the mayor around here. We don't have much to offer in way of food or drink, but we've had a decent harvest this year.

So as long as we're able to give coin and not cause trouble, your people are welcome here.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. You are so sweet.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Why did you folks come out this way, if I can ask?

[Speaker 2]
We are looking for a tower.

[Speaker 1]
Tower? Interesting.

[Speaker 4]
Why is it interesting?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not really familiar with any around the area, but I've only been about two towns over. I haven't seen everything on this side of the mountains. I've lived here pretty much my whole life.

But it's interesting, really, because most of the people who've been passing through here have been going the other way. Going back the way you came, specifically.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, how come?

[Speaker 1]
Every time they come through, there's complaints. There's dragons flying overhead. There's witches.

Dwarven holds have- their lights have shut off.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm. Huh. I don't like that.

Mommy, is that a lava duke?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Which direction are the dwarves?

[Speaker 1]
Are the dwarves? They are. If you're looking at your map, I will ping it for you.

If this foundry stops fucking telling me, then I'm disconnecting every two seconds.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Right here?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they're nestled up in the mountains there.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. They're having trouble with their light.

[Speaker 1]
Nah, they would have made a call out to the other settlements if they were.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's why I think it's mostly hogwash. Maybe there's a- maybe there is a witch in the woods playing tricks on peasant minds or something like that. We don't tend to get bothered much.

[Speaker 2]
All right. I feel like we're side-eyeing each other, like, romance! Mimosa will share her pastries and treats as, like, an exchange of the food.

[Speaker 1]
Very nice. Townsfolk, by and large, are pretty happy to have you around here. Is there anything that anybody wants to attempt to buy?

If there's, like, basic supplies you're looking to get or questions you're looking to ask while you guys are here? And if not, which direction would you like to head?

[Speaker 6]
How you guys originally set this up?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, which is where the witch and the dwarves are. Was that the only thing they said causing issues? A witch and the dwarven light?

There were also dragons. Okay, that's why I went, like, well, what do you do about dragons? Befriend them or kill them?

I don't know. It's Mimosa's track record.

[Speaker 1]
All right, roll for a subdual.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi is itching for a fight.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'm sure the dwarves would love a good bar fight. I'm sure they would. Okay, well, do we want to go towards the dwarves or do we want to go somewhere else?

[Speaker 4]
Well, since we're pretty close, because we entered around right here, so, I mean, it should be not too far a walk.

[Speaker 2]
All right, we'll go check on the dwarves. See if everything's honky-dory.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, boy, again?

[Speaker 1]
I guess so.

[Speaker 4]
Exciting.

[Speaker 1]
I've got a much better idea for this fucker.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
So, your first night out, the settlers are pretty frequently complaining about nightmares and stuff like that. They calm themselves down by putting up some bigger campfires, turning them into bonfires, singing songs. So, some of the caravan leaders are letting you know, like, hey, we're probably gonna make a little bit slower progress tomorrow, but it's better than having these folks get into a panic, or at least we think they are.

[Speaker 4]
Are we having nightmares, too?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, you don't seem to be. Oh. It's just a few people out of every wagon.

Oh, wow.

[Speaker 2]
What- That's normal. What kind of nightmares?

[Speaker 1]
Just stuff about, like, a fun out.

[Speaker 2]
I guess the point is, are they all the same, or are they all, like, their darkest, scariest things, or- It's just about, like, things coming out of the woods.

[Speaker 1]
It's the most common. Getting dragged- Getting lost in the woods is really common.

[Speaker 2]
All right, yeah, I would say let's- Oh, sorry. Let's keep together. We're not in the Cloud Forest, so that's fine.

Okay, yes, but we did get stalked by a bunch of free creatures last week.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, it's probably fine.

[Speaker 4]
Aren't the trees always watching?

[Speaker 1]
I want everybody to make me a percentage.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, oh.

[Speaker 2]
I think she'll just smile at Kibi. She doesn't like that.

[Speaker 1]
Who here has been to the Cloud Forest?

[Speaker 2]
That's where I went fishing. I think- Oh, I guess not specifically- I think Kibi went at one point, didn't she?

[Speaker 3]
I don't remember. But maybe I guess- I don't think Spix has, if I remember- I know- What's in this Cloud Forest? That's the High Bahamians.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think I've ever- I don't know if Bar's ever been.

[Speaker 2]
No, she has!

[Speaker 3]
I thought that's her- Yeah, Mimosa got teleported there. Because she was a part of that group where the- That Cloud Boy got fucking obliterated. And still hasn't come by for a re-revive or anything.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's busy.

[Speaker 1]
He's having a time right now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. He'll be welcome back with open arm when Bar's- It was the fishing episode where Mimosa fished and made a fishing pole. And that's where I figured out she was competitive.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay, so let's see here. I have Bix, Para, Mimosa, and a missing Kiwi.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, yes. Perception.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody gets a plus two additive, by the way.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Perception. I did not, so I get a 21.

[Speaker 1]
All right, then. Mimosa's the only one to notice. Just as like the idle comment of- At least there's no High Bahamians here.

Mimosa sees a arm roughly 40 feet in length silently pluck one of the caravaners that's kind of like standing on the outside edge of one of these bonfires by the neck and just pulls them back without making a single sound.

[Speaker 2]
Do I get the sense that I can go after them and save them or are they just poof?

[Speaker 1]
Um, their neck was not in the right shape when it was getting carried back to the woods.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Tribunal dinner, everybody! We're gonna have a feast tonight, all of us together!

[Speaker 1]
All right, some of the people come back.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody has to come back, please, for dinner! She's gonna go to the leaders of the caravan and be like, you cannot. You cannot let them stray.

Everybody has to be together away from the forest.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, sure.

[Speaker 2]
No, not yeah, sure. Like, you have to or they will die.

[Speaker 1]
What are you- Are we in danger? The guys of the previous town said like, everything's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they did, didn't they? They don't- they also don't leave their town very much.

[Speaker 1]
That's probably why they said everything's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, just do me a favor and no stragglers.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, yeah, sure.

[Speaker 2]
Just keep it away from the- Absolutely.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, of course. She's gonna tell the group that like, the forest is super, super janked. How do you know?

What do you mean? I just watched a giant hand grab a person and kill them and take them back into the forest. Oh, I wonder if my anti-thingy will work here.

[Speaker 3]
Para's gonna pull out her drift globe. This one works in the cloud forest, so I don't know if it'll work here. I hope it does.

I also don't know how far you have to be from it for it to work.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that hasn't been- Yeah, lightning is not gonna start suddenly striking the caravan. But a storm does roll in from over the mountains while you folks move along. Ugh, rain.

Yeah, it is very rain. Everybody's in relatively poor spirits at the moment.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I imagine Kibi will be drenched. Just, oh, her fur is completely messed up.

[Speaker 1]
The good news is this is happening right as you guys are getting over to- to the Dwarven Hold.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody in, in, in, in! Let's go! You start them.

I feel like since the day that we lost that one person, Mimosa has kept numbers. She's counted.

[Speaker 1]
You've only lost three more since then.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no! Okay.

[Speaker 1]
How many days would it have been? So that would have been another two days.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh, cool. Oh, cool.

Oh, that one doesn't come until after.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you guys make it to the, to the Dwarven Hold, and a bunch of the researchers are a little perturbed. They take note, they pull you guys aside. They're like, hey, um, you see those really big, they point out some sconces on the right and left side of the door that are supposed to, like, that appears like these very giant brassieres being held up by Dwarven figures.

[Speaker 3]
I think it's braziers.

[Speaker 2]
Braziers would be, uh, some boulder holders. Stone bras! Image in my mind, in my head.

[Speaker 1]
My very first session of D&D. Hey, look guys, stone bras!

[Speaker 2]
They're like, yeah, the Dwarven statues holding up.

[Speaker 6]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
But yeah, so, uh, yeah, those are supposed to be lit. I guess, I guess the town was right when they were talking about that. Or maybe some of those people were right when they were called back?

[Speaker 2]
What happens if they're not lit?

[Speaker 1]
We have no idea. Oh. They're supposed to be always lit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I think we need to get ready in case that it's haunted.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi immediately brings out her greatsword.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, just a little bit more casual, sweetie. Just a little bit more casual. I don't want to freak out the people.

But ghosts. Yes, ghosts. But if we start freaking out the people, they might try to go into the forest, and we all know they can't do that.

[Speaker 4]
She puts her sword back. But she's, like, very jumpy.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, okay then, I guess... Hang on.

[Speaker 6]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
While you guys are sitting here discussing this, the door opens.

[Speaker 6]
Somebody's opening it, right?

[Speaker 1]
There are no lights on in the city right now, with the exception of a fire near- towards the, uh, there's probably about three fires towards the back. Um, like wildfires, or- Oh, Jesus. Definitely, like, a building fire.

Some of the people are a little weirded out, but, like, they're just kind of walking in right now.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, oh, Mimosa will stop them. She's gonna run ahead and, like, everybody back out, just give us a moment.

[Speaker 1]
What's- the fire's all the way over there.

[Speaker 2]
No, it just- Just wait out here, please. Let's make sure that we're allowed. That was my bad.

I made a mistake. Let's make sure that we have permission to come in. Okay, so can we see people in these fires?

Or not in the fires, but, like, with the fires, like, can we see people?

[Speaker 1]
They're pretty far away. It's, like, uh, like, basically half a city away.

[Speaker 4]
We have to walk through the city in the dark?

[Speaker 6]
What's up?

[Speaker 4]
We have to walk through the city in the dark? That's rough.

[Speaker 1]
You'll probably see some little moving figure- figures, like, moving around the edges of the fire.

[Speaker 2]
Does anybody have, like, a message or something? Can- does it work that way? Can someone just do magic, please?

Can someone magic fix this? Yeah. Is there a way to talk to them all the way over there?

[Speaker 3]
I have sending.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have to know the person that you're sending it to? That's my concern. As Nessie- I have to be familiar with it.

Mimosa doesn't know about that.

[Speaker 3]
No, don't eat that. But I want to. He does.

It's hat food. Of course he does. But it's medicated, so he can't.

Oh, no. It's the wrong one. Anyway, um, hmm.

Do I have something for this? Mayhaps. Perhaps.

Uh, nope. I don't really have anything for this. Uh, well, um, anybody got some binoculars?

Ow, ow, stop biting me.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, actually- Or you could just go. Somebody in the- Oh. I think definitely would.

[Speaker 2]
I was just wondering if I actually gave Mimosa binoculars, but I could be thinking of somebody else.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody definitely has binoculars. I think we have a magic set of binoculars or something.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, cool. Parents can go ask around. All right, we asked to use those binoculars.

Take a magnifying glass.

[Speaker 1]
So you guys now have access to a pair of binoculars. What are you guys looking for? Where are you looking at?

[Speaker 2]
What do those people look like? At the camp. At the campfire.

[Speaker 1]
At the campfire? Uh, they look like they are stumbling. They're actually quite large for the population of ostensibly dwarves.

They look pretty large.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, this city does not belong to dwarves anymore. Nope. I say we take our leave.

The tower is obviously not here.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We've been here the whole time and I didn't even realize. Oh, I wondered why you were so quiet.

[Speaker 3]
Could be survivors.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, us.

[Speaker 3]
What? Yeah. Yeah, do we agree to just like quietly shut the door and walk away and like- Well, unfortunately, I have the ability to do locate creature.

I have it now because I have it prepared. Oh, rich! I can locate creature of a specific kind.

Pera's gonna go for dwarf. And I think... Um, yeah, in a different form.

I don't think that counts with undead. I don't know. I don't know if that counts with like undead or anything.

I wouldn't think so personally, but that's kind of a James call. That's a good question.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you get a ping about a hundred feet above wherever the gate, where the top of the gate.

[Speaker 3]
A hundred feet above the top of the gate, like not in the city?

[Speaker 1]
Well, in the city, insofar as that's definitely in the rock is where you're getting that ping.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we could have dwarves hiding out.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Pera's gonna let her know that they're not in the city. Let them know that there's some dwarves up in, up there. I think we should at least check it out.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, can't say I'm not curious.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, is there an obvious way to get there? Or is it just like, yep, there sure is rock up there.

[Speaker 1]
If there are staircases that go from like adjacent to the tower up to the, kind of like adjacent to the tower, up to the, going further up into the rock. You don't know where they go, but that's a start.

[Speaker 3]
All right, well I have this for one hour, as long as I keep concentration on it, so.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we're going upstairs? Yeah. Okay, please, please, please, to the group that isn't going up the stairs, do not go into that city, no matter what.

And if you do, you're on your own. Haha, cool. I think she'll just like, hurry, keep you along.

Haha.

[Speaker 3]
Pyrrha's gonna leave her little um anti-hide-behind thing with them yeah will it be a bad idea maybe but she will keep him safe

[Speaker 1]
hopefully we don't lose they don't lose it it's stairs as you guys are moving along you see getting ready to go you go inside and start moving along you do see a shape very very large compared to all of the other figures that you've been observing cast against the shadow or casting sorry being a silhouette of this figure up against the particular one of the fires in the back there big

[Speaker 2]
dwarfs I'm sure we'll find out unfortunately I knew I should have

[Speaker 1]
brought my old lady but you guys are going upstairs all right so to start off with there are a bunch of there a bunch of tours on the stairs themselves they are kind of walking listlessly they have crossbows and Cadillac's and this

[Speaker 2]
particular on this stairwell there are three of them do we leave them and try not to engage are they like guard are they again can I percept to see if

[Speaker 1]
they're like alive mm-hmm try to make me a perception check with the van yeah oh that was not with advantage but he's definitely undead okay are they coming

[Speaker 2]
up on her locate creature okay okay this isn't them oh okay so do we want to get past them stealthily well yeah I mean it's worth a shot okay this is my time it's my turn would it do anything if they're dead you might do all you might

[Speaker 1]
slice through their spinal cords it's a magical rod but I have to be our B real

[Speaker 2]
quick we don't draw attention to yourself he wants you to keep using that yeah all right where's my girl should be this is weapon we're talking about interested in action it's a tool to strangle and subdue I don't that's awesome that all right how many does you're gonna spend on this my level right um oh I'll do three said t8 right mm-hmm okay all right so 3d8 all right

[Speaker 1]
so all right so it's taking it's taking damage but it's beginning to struggle a

[Speaker 2]
I tighten it I okay is this my that so the the d8 is a check okay so then what

[Speaker 1]
would be the grapple check then oh that's right so for if you're sneaking up behind him I'm just gonna have it like automatically okay okay okay so

[Speaker 2]
then I just use another d8 okay I'm gonna use another okay so basically

[Speaker 1]
you're gonna keep rolling those 3d8 okay and he's gonna attempt to make a save he fails and the head just kind of there's a just very quietly okay I'll

[Speaker 2]
move to the next one then I guess just make my way you guys can follow the

[Speaker 1]
corpses yeah

[Speaker 3]
oh that was mistake oh you okay there I I'm applying some biofreeze on my shoulder cuz it's hurting and I literally just did a massage where I put biofreeze all over a guy's body I don't know why I forgot about how much it

[Speaker 1]
stung my eyes all right um there is if the garrot incapacitates your target before you release them you regain all expended trap dice I would assume decapitation gives them back exactly oh okay that's fine okay okay you did not

[Speaker 2]
all right next dead guy I'll do three again you gotta read at them

[Speaker 1]
he's struggling again what's your DC um it'll be your proficiency bonus and like basically an ability check of your choice or ability score the ability score modifier of your choice side of hand the dexterity yeah okay yeah so

[Speaker 3]
nine I think it's usually plus it's usually plus ten so like if you have

[Speaker 2]
18 cuz my proficiency plus my dex is 9 so it would be 19 it would be 17 17 must

[Speaker 1]
be because it's supposed to be plus a save DC is 8 plus etc oh he fails he does fail all right he's dead just barely

[Speaker 2]
just have like 24 hit points each yeah next one these guys are pretty easy if we've come across more the next time we can all take them out yeah plus Paris

[Speaker 3]
here so I have turn undead again wait so what do these things look like

[Speaker 1]
there's they do in fact look like dwarves just just so that we have one on the map all right and then the most you could go ahead and roll versus the next dwarf there I did I got 21 go on all right he gets one more save where should I get dropped oh you can get dropped anywhere okay put these guys all right and he failed so and you literally can't roll less than us then what it takes to kill him there's 24 hit points exactly

[Speaker 2]
oh I can't oh that's so nice except I almost did it wrong oh I'm why what

[Speaker 1]
let's mark out the gate

[Speaker 2]
here where are we supposed to have our tokens by the gate or the stairs

[Speaker 1]
right down to the bottom left hand side by the stairs okay

[Speaker 4]
Kibi left her elephant outside and um yeah we did bring those elephants

[Speaker 2]
the elephants will keep everyone safe hopefully yeah me or they'll be bigger

[Speaker 1]
bait for the hands all right so there are three tomb drawers

[Speaker 4]
head at your feet have anything interesting on them

[Speaker 1]
let's see here they do let's see here go ahead and make an investigation check wait am i there sure

[Speaker 2]
you're just going up after the kills pick picking their

[Speaker 1]
oh well what am i rolling investigation investee 19 all right you're playing three point three pints of oil three flasks of oil i guess three how many flasks of oil three three

[Speaker 4]
flasks of oil i'm sure this could be useful at some point to light someone on fire or something

[Speaker 1]
so there is a little room next to you guys uh it's currently unoccupied and there's a door on one side okay a couple of desks here and some papers rather large looking book oh what's the book everybody speak dwarvish

[Speaker 2]
come on nope last night do not

[Speaker 1]
i do yay looks to be a shipping manifest the last entry was about i look at when that was about two months ago

[Speaker 2]
oh is there anything significant or weird in what they

[Speaker 1]
brought in or what like so the very last item on the shipping manifest was a bell oh i'm sure this is not a friend of obsidian and there was people going through great lengths to procure it

[Speaker 2]
okay um i'm gonna this is gonna gently tear the page out i'm just gonna like fold it up and tuck it as evidence uh is there anything else what did you say was in this room just

[Speaker 1]
some dust and stuff like that okay it's like this was basically used for accountings and and there's a door

[Speaker 2]
a door we go through the door quietly oh i think we still

[Speaker 3]
yeah we're gonna stealth oh my best subject yeah that's what i expected

[Speaker 6]
oh

[Speaker 5]
oh no can i can i can i carry para so she isn't having this elf

[Speaker 3]
i was gonna say oh wait that was supposed to be a disadvantage but i really guess i can't lower lower

[Speaker 6]
you can roll two ones okay or you could roll it's money and it

[Speaker 4]
be really angering oh excuse me what are you rolling oh

[Speaker 1]
that's damage of course anyways uh that was a pretty big roof on the other side here

[Speaker 2]
um where did we get hurt from is that no that was that was a joke that

[Speaker 1]
was you guys did not take 46 damage that's

[Speaker 2]
all right well then we go on our way wincing all right is it her tail it's her tail making the noise

[Speaker 1]
it is very loud uh luckily the next room is let's see here it looks like a collapsed section uh there's actually a bunch of treasure in here which in order to open the door basically a parrot tried helping open the door sneakily and then just like stumbled into a bunch of buckets of treasure knocking them over it was

[Speaker 2]
straight out of moria that's i was trying to find the gif of that

[Speaker 1]
i wasn't using the right keywords and it looks like there's a bunch of rubble and treasure that's piled up against a door on the right well they're not using it here there's about 250 loose gold pieces around here yeah i

[Speaker 2]
assume we scoop that up i mean are the doors really gonna need it

[Speaker 1]
there are two doors both of which have been collapsed by rubble

[Speaker 2]
okay so we have to go back try and clear through it yeah we can try um let's just take you guys like 10 minutes okay which door do we want to spend the first 10 minutes on

[Speaker 1]
um where is para feeling the pings her is feeling opinions to the north

[Speaker 2]
all right i want to clear the doors did you say the doors yes probably it's fine i'm feeling it further up okay so we need to find stairs and more stairs more stairs okay um kiwi can you help us clear the debris absolutely

[Speaker 4]
that'd be a strength i guess

[Speaker 2]
hey big strong muscles

[Speaker 1]
oh i didn't know that i have to have brogan okay so you guys clear off the um you clear off the all right sorry sorry you clear up you clear away the rubble and now the door opens amazing what do we see there's a passageway it looks to go for about 60 feet okay

[Speaker 4]
wait are we in here yeah i love all the the rolling that we have no idea

[Speaker 2]
he's making he's rolling for the map all right so this is about 30 feet well here we go then

[Speaker 1]
oh boy and when you step inside the a wall closes off the passage behind

[Speaker 4]
you yeah oh no i'm scratching this is para not coming with

[Speaker 1]
oh i figured i would but you said that before i moved i figured that you were i was even looking at my screen

[Speaker 2]
okay i would have been with them okay so then i assume vix is with us too you're happy with

[Speaker 3]
not moving your token uh hopefully bar is not muted again

[Speaker 5]
no i'm here okay okay but yeah i assume you're with us you're just not moving your token yes i was on another tab sorry that's okay this is an ominously narrow corridor

[Speaker 2]
yeah and once you come join us you're gonna be trapped with us

[Speaker 5]
what fun yeah

[Speaker 4]
you'd be scratching at it like furiously

[Speaker 2]
no we're trapped okay well i guess let's just keep going there's no other doors it's just like the end of this corridor that

[Speaker 1]
turns well sorry you come across a wide passageway stop doing that oh okay here we go so it goes in two separate directions um which way do we want to go the warp signal is right above you hmm it starts moving forward a little bit and that falls to the same level of as you on the right hand side and you hear a gunshot that escalated

[Speaker 2]
uh para's gonna kind of is it open to us as well

[Speaker 1]
yeah there's a door yeah oh i mean we heard it coming from

[Speaker 2]
um do you tell us to go this direction para's gonna be like hey hello oh did we get shot at or did we just

[Speaker 1]
hear it you just heard the shot from behind the door okay yeah in dwarvish what do we hear i helped but uh in a rather in a way that i can't scream right now because it's okay

[Speaker 2]
yeah it's fine and there's a door right here that's correct all right i try to open it is it locked

[Speaker 1]
it is in fact locked

[Speaker 2]
this is gonna sound stupid but do you have a key

[Speaker 1]
oh no no i don't have a game please okay okay he has an axe

[Speaker 4]
kiwi can smash door if i have this

[Speaker 2]
i i assumed i had mimosa start to lock lock picket

[Speaker 1]
pick lock all right mimosa you pick it uh two i'm gonna roll you do it in one uh you open the door uh dwarf stumbles out over you he has no idea do npc token and there is a wait no that's not it there we go oh oh dear i'm

[Speaker 2]
gonna shut the door go ahead and roll me initiative dang it initiative someday shutting the door will work

[Speaker 4]
all right keebs don't fail me well the problem is a lot of things do

[Speaker 3]
in fact have hands to um

[Speaker 2]
open the doors with well i was hoping to like pull on it until it's locked sometimes i have to do that to go to the bathroom

[Speaker 4]
oh i have i have um advantage on initiative rolls

[Speaker 2]
um so i'm gonna roll again i guess um it it gave me the option like when i went to click initiative it highlighted the advantage box so i didn't click it because i forgot until i checked the best advantage roll in the initiative

[Speaker 3]
yeah i think there is a uh yeah there's um in the special traits on the attributes page there is a like check box for advantage on initiative um if that's something that you forget consistently that might be a nice nice way to do it uh right where d so um it's kind of in the small text to the right hand side yeah it's not letting me i clicked it a

[Speaker 1]
couple times so just hold like a d20 and if okay all right

[Speaker 2]
did you say no there you go all right 15 oh you said special traits plus two yeah would be yeah i have i have uh they just wanted me to highlight so that would be a 17 i hate that i'm in front and i'm last yeah uh-oh going to begin

[Speaker 1]
arm annihilation and it's going to use withering gaze on mimosas oh oh yeah nice i'm a mother of five i expected that look

[Speaker 6]
all right and that is its turn let's see here that

[Speaker 5]
brings us to vix um can i move to it

[Speaker 6]
uh would that be moving through people you can

[Speaker 2]
walk over both of us there's kind of because we're small we're small and i have a feet that lets me go under people so i can just kind of duck

[Speaker 1]
17 i'm just gonna make morgan the bear uh the of course that's what 17 hits i look that even in his dwarf form he's

[Speaker 3]
just morgan the bear i mean i guess nothing stops him from being a bear as a dwarf but

[Speaker 1]
you know are these uh are these magical weapons nope

[Speaker 5]
i need magic weapons i should get my hands on some

[Speaker 1]
body half damage all right is that vix's turn

[Speaker 5]
yes unless anybody would um i'm gonna move myself over a little bit in case kb wants to

[Speaker 1]
get in there all right that's totally fine let's see here uh would vix make me a

[Speaker 3]
constitution's in throw oh uh give me one second you only need to make a 13 i'm gonna give you some orb dice for that orb dice how many orb dice do i want to do 13 and you got seven that's we need like seven more so i'll do maybe three i really should learn which dice i'm supposed to be rolling for this eights we'll do four instead

[Speaker 2]
there you go i love the over panic

[Speaker 3]
that's not 13 anymore it's that and i used i'm terrible with math so in my head i was like well i don't want to do one because i can roll lower i don't want to do two because i could absolutely get two ones three seems fine i'll just do four

[Speaker 4]
that's that's my thought process as well actually

[Speaker 3]
plus i rolled like two sevens and eights so

[Speaker 1]
para go ahead and make me a constitution's labor row

[Speaker 2]
is he smelly or something

[Speaker 1]
or is that this stare is still oh it's just really ugly it's okay it's also really ugly all right para makes it uh you can also avert your eyes into product damage i should probably ask you guys that if you're averting your eyes uh i am now kibi

[Speaker 4]
does not face away from danger i don't know

[Speaker 3]
um have you done the thing do you want me to do my turn now or yes

[Speaker 1]
yeah oh okay i thought you were doing something so no i'm just going to see what this area was to get stairs that go upward oh you rolled clicked on me yeah i did it by accident

[Speaker 3]
all right well i'm gonna squeak it get squeaked idiot um and then i am going to um guiding guiding bolt what is that radiant yeah that sounds like it's appropriate for this advantage because i'm squeaked that is rude advantage

[Speaker 4]
well this is an interesting looking shape

[Speaker 1]
i believe 14 oh 14 just missed it

[Speaker 3]
oh

[Speaker 1]
alas but you had advantage on do you have advantage on your own

[Speaker 3]
i already rolled with advantage it was a three and a two all right usually my advantage rolls um what kind of lighting situation do we

[Speaker 1]
got here you are in dim light okay then i don't

[Speaker 3]
take five necrotic damage okay

[Speaker 4]
all right kibi is going to run with her great sword um are you averting your gaze no she specifically said she doesn't she does not look away from danger danger looks away from me um all right this great sword um the great sword that you gave this one con save yeah

[Speaker 2]
con save can i just say no keep you forgot to con save that's typical

[Speaker 3]
how'd i do um well i think i got my thing back so i can actually roll you some i'm gonna go on the cautious side and

[Speaker 1]
fail oh okay kibi got 28 now all right kibi you get to heal that damage back up

[Speaker 4]
hey thank you all right axe time per sword time

[Speaker 1]
sword time

[Speaker 3]
oh nice uh that war song's pretty nice because um you are at advantage actually am i yes i squeaked it

[Speaker 1]
squeaked it right i'm gonna make a special squeak condition

[Speaker 4]
all right roll an additional 1d 12 okay i can do that slash r 1d 12 wonderful 23 oh no no it's for damage ah damage damage i thought i'd rolled damage actually all right there we go

[Speaker 1]
all right how about your second attack right

[Speaker 3]
what about it um that should also be an advantage

[Speaker 6]
holy crap

[Speaker 3]
oh okay hungry well

[Speaker 1]
that's my turn all right kimi you take 500 product damage at the end of your

[Speaker 4]
turn okay oh boy i have to do math one no i have to do math

[Speaker 2]
um um i guess i'll just flip on over here i met oh it's still gridded no whatever um i'll be right back sure is mimosa averting her eyes yes i'm i am becoming she's she's getting in tune with her inner chihuahua she's gonna bite she's gonna go for the ankles

[Speaker 3]
well what's nice is that the disadvantage from averting your eyes is um nullified by the advantage i would also argue

[Speaker 2]
that she is short so her natural gaze is like waste or whatever not his face so whatever i hit with the disadvantage no you just hit with regular attack

[Speaker 3]
okay

[Speaker 1]
no sneak attack unfortunately oh i thought because she squeaked no but if you have disadvantage on any if you have disadvantage for any reason you lose out on that sneak attack i'll have to roll again

[Speaker 2]
okay cool please get 26 that's not number i oh i thought you were saying okay there we go that's sad that's fine it would be cool if it was 26 that would have been fun

[Speaker 1]
what would you like to do for your bonus action

[Speaker 2]
uh i'll just hit him again does that hit

[Speaker 1]
it turned wait nope dismisses 14 okay then the estimate torn all right let's top that around with the bodeg uh does the dwarf get a turn reloading his shotgun

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 1]
i'm nasty right now so he's gonna force kibi to make constitute wisdom save i don't think it has any wisdom saves no health or constitution

[Speaker 2]
now what do you got keeping wanna say she'd be our bead

[Speaker 1]
oh you're right two i'm gonna use all bix instead

[Speaker 5]
is it fix also brb no i'm here i just quiet i wasn't sure if you said it was my turn or if i was dead he's gonna he's gonna

[Speaker 1]
target you with this stuff you're getting hit yeah

[Speaker 3]
god damn it alas i've already used my reaction

[Speaker 5]
um is this in no it's not it's not an area of effect so i heard you talking about sneak attack no sneak attack

[Speaker 1]
oh so if you have if you're looking away well if you're averting your gaze at the start of your turn which i need you to decide on whether or not you're doing uh you won't be able to get sneak attack

[Speaker 3]
but you have advantage so if you might hit it anyways

[Speaker 1]
but you won't have sneak attack can see the bodak's

[Speaker 5]
eyes can i get behind it uh i don't know if we're doing facing

[Speaker 1]
right now i'll think about uh tell you what yeah go ahead and and try that out i don't know if i would let this work for like a medusa or something but this is a pretty low level enemy i don't know who doesn't have a lot of

[Speaker 2]
battlefield right now can it turn its head like an

[Speaker 5]
owl oh it can oh that's gross okay but in that case i um i will look at it you throw a blanket over its head

[Speaker 2]
oh i know what i'm doing on my turn if it's still alive hey you make it all

[Speaker 1]
right go ahead and attack if that's what you're doing there you go and that's the end of my turn all right at the end of your turn you

[Speaker 5]
aren't you a rogue oh it's only on one that's right

[Speaker 1]
all right how would you like to do this um

[Speaker 5]
bix is just bix is a fey bix is not frightened of creepy things um and so they're staring it straight in its creepy eye sockets um and the dagger goes straight into one and twists

[Speaker 1]
very nice you watch as its mouth kind of like collapses in on that void or watches its like mundane jaw just collapses in on itself into this yeah little void inside of its mouth and at the back of its throat just kind of crumples into a pile of flesh and a profaned broom and thread covered cloth

[Speaker 2]
well that was disgusting uh she's gonna turn into a dwarf are you

[Speaker 5]
injured too badly oh oh i

[Speaker 1]
yeah i could use help but my my my kids my kids my kids who children helium leaks helium leaks um i i drew i drew this critter away from them but their their hold up and there were there were more coming for them

[Speaker 2]
all right oh well then that helps this is not good let's get going what's the quickest way up there

[Speaker 1]
uh up these stairs and then uh up these stairs and then down

[Speaker 2]
we go yep oh why is the dog still going the bodak is creating our map

[Speaker 4]
he died and he realized that he could do better with his undeath so now he is creating instead of destroying

[Speaker 3]
there's a lot of critters in um pathfinder that when they die they explode into effects it sucks i love it every time because nessie

[Speaker 2]
forgets every time i have never played pathfinder and i really like mouth on creature as it explodes almost every single time see here there are

[Speaker 1]
all right so you come out into a brief small chamber here and there are two side passages right next to each other one of which emergency well this is an emergency maintenance and the other one is like large and hallway sized i assume the dwarf is coming with us

[Speaker 2]
absolutely all right yeah where's he going yeah we let him lead the way

[Speaker 1]
oh he's like yes yes of course i was about to be like well no i don't want to go before the adventurers like no there's a dwarf of course

[Speaker 4]
a dwarf whose children are yeah we'll go for

[Speaker 2]
we'll go through maintenance para do you sense any more doors besides

[Speaker 3]
well he's too close so i would just you know always be sensing him

[Speaker 1]
unfortunately oh dang it okay if you recast it then you could send somebody

[Speaker 2]
you don't have to if if this is a trap we'll just kill him fine

[Speaker 6]
we're just talking about this behind it

[Speaker 2]
i need whispering i love all the people making the map yeah we'll wait it's fine

[Speaker 3]
i'll take this moment to

[Speaker 1]
all right he opens the door there's a red glowing light uh basically a rock there's several rocks in this room that also function as light sources they're random nature he's explaining while he goes along the the other the other corridor they they were still following me through i managed to close it but the bodak came out the other way

[Speaker 2]
so what actually happened here one moment so i'm pretty sure there's a

[Speaker 1]
monster in this room okay

[Speaker 2]
what'd you get he's gonna get her cloak ready by the way

[Speaker 6]
we're gonna just walk in space

[Speaker 2]
change of music oh ew ew why does it look like a

[Speaker 4]
gross defective baby

[Speaker 1]
perhaps it is but okay but hey the boneless two boneless in here uh there is a this appears to be like a backup generator room uh the generator is in the side of the

[Speaker 2]
room right now they had electricity well

[Speaker 1]
that's correct they did have it uh it's currently mimosa i'm gonna have you move back a little bit just because uh this thing is currently arcing electricity right now it's arcing it up to the little red um red light that's above it but i'm gonna have you folks blow me

[Speaker 4]
initiative i'm debuffed advantage this time it still says erie i don't know how to fix that he be everywhere else

[Speaker 3]
i could fix it for you

[Speaker 2]
well it didn't whatever

[Speaker 3]
because you got to change your um prototype token actually wait what do we have do we have prototype tokens here okay you

[Speaker 1]
do have tokens there's one thing i couldn't fucking get my lancer players to fix every single time i'm like why isn't my thing every single fucking time yeah it'll only refresh when you uh put

[Speaker 3]
it hurry down again but that should fix it fix what uh her name shows up as erie oh okay

[Speaker 4]
i thought it was her name to begin with but kibi is cuter so

[Speaker 1]
kibi yeah it's erie's turn all right

[Speaker 2]
um electricity right yes over here uh if he's is he no it was exactly my thought i speak to it uh um can i throw

[Speaker 4]
an axe at him i don't want to touch him yeah

[Speaker 1]
try to get it to arc outwards i don't know what that means

[Speaker 3]
are you hitting the guy or are you trying like are you trying to avoid the electricity are you trying to push him into the electricity oh that's a good idea hold on where's the electricity that was

[Speaker 1]
was it's gonna arc to like metal or something like that

[Speaker 4]
so if i throw the axe at him at this or at him i think at him okay oh hold on no i don't want to move um oh i have a javelin too how does one how do you make a throw

[Speaker 1]
attack is that a separate thing how do you uh i would just i would just roll an attack 26

[Speaker 4]
make six hits row it over

[Speaker 1]
all right not reduce this um but let's see here a little bit of lightning does arc out okay for eight which he has two four can i throw another one sure awesome

[Speaker 6]
yeah yeah all right nope

[Speaker 4]
nope is that a person inside of his chest

[Speaker 1]
yep you can see a few different dwarves are inside of his chest brings us to para annihilate these people

[Speaker 3]
yeah para's gonna do a hop skip and a jump over here she's gonna squeak yet again yeah she's gonna squeak yet again um so that's just all of them all of them have been squeaked and i'm gonna do spirit guardians i'll do fifth level spirit guardians so they all gotta make a wisdom save boy only one boneless makes it what's the damage um damage was 18

[Speaker 1]
all right i think both bonelesses die

[Speaker 4]
as they should

[Speaker 6]
already

[Speaker 1]
all right is that the end of uh person yes brings us to fix and the most will be awesome you know what i do it's this one does not have

[Speaker 5]
oh that one probably doesn't hit

[Speaker 1]
hold on all right that's it for me all right it brings us to

[Speaker 2]
i'll give him my chairs yummy kitty

[Speaker 1]
that hits okay all right and go ahead and add an extra d10 back oh okay nice cool and both both you and the devourer take one lucky day oh ourself from the generator that you're probably standing next to and uh oh my hair's gonna get frizzy it is 100% frizzy at this moment

[Speaker 4]
damn it okay at least you aren't like 100% covered in fur

[Speaker 1]
the dwarf is going to step over does the 18 hit 18 does it really has yeah

[Speaker 2]
damn okay now you're doing another thing oh

[Speaker 1]
all right you take seven the devourer takes

[Speaker 6]
not

[Speaker 1]
but he is not looking good all right uh let's see here the dwarf is going to attack

[Speaker 2]
oh oh wait no he had advantage i am so angry that morgan's attacking us oh wait no yeah he's telling you he says

[Speaker 6]
let me through let me through

[Speaker 1]
i just stuffed both barrels into this thing and it's too eager to stuff it into its mouth and just kind of most of the pellets like deflect off its nasty ass teeth and then it can multi-task oh it's gonna start off with this

[Speaker 2]
oh keep you safe what the fuck was that

[Speaker 1]
i need everybody in this little circle here to make me a constitution saving throw hey guys just so you know i heard what

[Speaker 3]
sounded like a transformer blowing um if i suddenly vanish it's because my

[Speaker 5]
power went out oh hey stay alive

[Speaker 3]
oh i mean it didn't go out immediately so let's see um i can only up one person's i think with my reaction so unfortunately mimosa i'm close i was i was already gonna say

[Speaker 2]
it's fine just let her fail it and fix takes

[Speaker 5]
no damage because of evasion okay so that's

[Speaker 1]
ah oh that's only for dexterity saving uh and then this is brightly lit because

[Speaker 3]
the electricity and stuff right this is brightly lit right okay all right so you're right um can i put out the healing word

[Speaker 1]
or does that happen too quick uh i think it so it doesn't just knock him to zero hit points like it goes past his maximum

[Speaker 2]
oh no that's fine does that 50 apply to me as well

[Speaker 1]
yeah oh they take half on success oh i would just use like the for something like this it's just like nah he's just i have pretty much a third of a life it's gonna be less in a moment i know

[Speaker 2]
yeah if it's hitting me i have 16 armor class

[Speaker 1]
22 to hit bakes holy shit owie

[Speaker 2]
maybe maybe we just find the kids and run away

[Speaker 1]
i can do a thing yes on candy dodge which will have the damage

[Speaker 5]
yep i am at one hit point oh my god

[Speaker 1]
oh crap let's go have this guy appear on the road next time all right uh that is the end of his turn so that brings us to

[Speaker 3]
kiwi kiwi rage oh wait um he also started his turn in my spirit guardians so he needs to make a whiz save didn't

[Speaker 1]
he already do that for the it's when he first

[Speaker 3]
enters and when he uh starts his turn and when he starts his

[Speaker 1]
turn all right this might undo all of that

[Speaker 6]
wouldn't that be nice

[Speaker 3]
yeah we roll that damage for you there

[Speaker 1]
all right he's dead all right never mind hey okay he beats his marriage because there's no reason to go all right picks you can heal up the 70 hit points you took or wait no it was with the the 60 hit uh the 20 45 hit points you took and i think uh mimosa took 50 and the dwarf isn't dead the dwarf is not dead

[Speaker 3]
holy crap thank the gods i mean i have revivify i was gonna heal him right away okay i have that for how long 10 minutes so i will make that a thing because i forgot because i forgot to put my distance on it i'm gonna pick up my javelin that i threw is 15 feet

[Speaker 1]
sounds good the door jace the door on the left of you guys is currently um it sounds like something's trying to break it down something too it's not terribly good at it but if we will eventually pick this

[Speaker 2]
way through um how heavy is this big guy pretty heavy can we just push it against the door up

[Speaker 1]
against the fucking door

[Speaker 4]
can't be can you help absolutely do i need to roll for that no okay he grabs him makes a lot of grunting noises pushes him against the door awesome this thing's ugly but it's even uglier now that it's in ruins

[Speaker 1]
okay all right you guys uh there's a door on the bottom side here

[Speaker 6]
ladies first

[Speaker 1]
i'll open it good okay so there is see here first things first there's no devourer in here a bunch of tomb doors these guys are devourers smacking at the uh the door here you can hear crying from what sounds like children inside and

[Speaker 4]
oh does anybody have any fire

[Speaker 1]
they're being very loud and very finally there is a vent at the top of this area and you can see two boneless one of which is uh you just barely see his feet sticking

[Speaker 4]
out of the vent he's venting oh

[Speaker 1]
big sus the dwarf behind you is screaming right now

[Speaker 2]
yeah yeah yes um oh um do these tomb dwarves

[Speaker 3]
here in my light of circle have to do anything so this is yeah because they're in my they're in my aura now do you want me to roll a new damage uh yeah okay five not g8 d8 what little hat is this guy wearing ow ow ow sorry augie i didn't realize

[Speaker 1]
you got stuck in me actually i love it i think it's supposed to be like a bronze thing but it's like tarnished yeah it kind of looks like a gourd one and a new one this guy is going to be toast and this guy's gonna have half a second left everyone go ahead and roll initiative

[Speaker 4]
zary is kiwi's middle name

[Speaker 1]
all right very top of the round boneless makes it into the room

[Speaker 5]
oh i forgot to roll initiative

[Speaker 1]
oh shit well bix what do we got for us

[Speaker 5]
well shit what do i have i know what i'm gonna do i am going to restrain myself when it comes to doing the stabbing um bonus action disengage okay

[Speaker 1]
all right so that was this one and now the boneless goes finishes going through the vent and into the kids room

[Speaker 4]
kiwi's gonna rage um all right i'm not muted right nope don't fight all right cool um rage kiwi gets angy um and let's see i think i think we find it really quickly

[Speaker 5]
where is it

[Speaker 4]
there's a thing about attacking that i that i have reckless no uh you know what i'm just gonna attack worry about it later okay so you know what i'm gonna go for this screaming ugly guy

[Speaker 1]
what do you think of warsong

[Speaker 4]
no i was looking um oh yeah no i'd say uh it's a feature that i have somewhere um and i think it has to do with like if i attack somebody if they they get disadvantaged or something like that

[Speaker 3]
um well let me look through my shit

[Speaker 4]
well raging your the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors which hinders its attack kill the start of your next turn that target has disadvantaged any attack against you um and if when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack the creature has resistant resistance to damage dealt by that attack all right so so this guy right here is uh yeah and i have one more attack and i'm rolling good i'll just put this here so i don't have to read it

[Speaker 1]
be sure to apply your rage damage while you're in there

[Speaker 4]
uh how does that work yes whenever you're rolling

[Speaker 1]
just add a just put two in circumstantial bonuses before okay the devourer's up he's gonna attack keepie twice bring it yeah all right so the total necrotic was 23 and 17 and then all the rest was slashing damage did i just have it so you have the well you only have the stuff that's slashing so the 17 you take all of and then you have the 12 for 6 and then the 23 you take all of but you have the

[Speaker 4]
8 or 4 so what's the total of that i'm really bad at math

[Speaker 1]
no it's fine so 8 and 6 that's 14 plus 40 so 54 damage total okay that's after having the um that's after having the slashing damage

[Speaker 4]
oh boy oh geez he's gonna move further

[Speaker 3]
no you're not allowed to do that yeah he also moved into my thing so please make

[Speaker 4]
me a wisdom sand can i um anybody near me within 30 feet taking damage i can use my reaction to half or to reduce the damage by 2d6 can i do that

[Speaker 2]
uh for probably do it for para or i para fails

[Speaker 4]
oh it's coming okay come see me girl and then i gotta make another one

[Speaker 2]
i was trying but when i went to click it it scrolled up

[Speaker 4]
oh no i'm over it mimosa i will ha i will i will do the the damage there

[Speaker 1]
all right mimosa you would take 40 except you take uh 33 instead the rest of you who failed take 40 the rest of you who

[Speaker 4]
succeeded victor uh did i succeed what did i what did i roll i doubt i succeeded what was the thing

[Speaker 3]
40

[Speaker 4]
the dc was higher than 11 okay yeah um he is on the ground

[Speaker 3]
um oh you went down yeah okay no you didn't oh a lot you get um 15 back former incumbent clutch

[Speaker 1]
thank you all right but that is the end of his turn now it comes to the bodak and the bodak gonna activate aura of annihilation and he's going to do withering days on kiwi

[Speaker 4]
you really want to kill kiwi don't you

[Speaker 1]
he's right there the undead are just so good at this ah you're gonna take that all right i'm still

[Speaker 4]
all right well i'm not doing great but that is the end of his turn

[Speaker 3]
we come now the parent all right um so i have a uh question for you so turn undead it says h undead that can see or hear you my voice can carry through event right that's correct so they all have to make a wisdom save all of them already and for you know just because i'm going to squeak with my last little bonus action

[Speaker 1]
this phone was succeeded

[Speaker 3]
i don't know i don't know um what their crs are but anything below a

[Speaker 1]
three just dies oh okay all right so actually both opponents just died is it uh that's only equal to three

[Speaker 3]
uh cr3 uh but that's only if it fails its saving throw

[Speaker 1]
oh okay and this tune will disguise and the podak failed its save it's frightened and the devourer also failed its save so it's also frightened it'll clear that condition at a moment because it's currently this is it's going to take damage at the start of its turn

[Speaker 3]
okay yeah that's why i squeaked it

[Speaker 2]
okay i'm just gonna squeeze squeeze on by when i get this guy is this guy squeaked

[Speaker 3]
um the big guy is squeaked okay the boneless is not okay it's only

[Speaker 1]
10 feet unfortunately it's all good seven hit points left so you can

[Speaker 2]
probably get him with your hand and that's it that's a foundry not

[Speaker 1]
at you

[Speaker 2]
cool um

[Speaker 1]
um modifier so nine hit points is supposed to have max was only while the bone was kept uh changes but yeah um

[Speaker 2]
that's my last movement and bonus action can i get my cloak ready to cover up this dude's head

[Speaker 1]
oh i figured you were gonna attack the devourer

[Speaker 2]
yeah this guy huh should i attack the devourer or should i cover the guy who does the stupid glare to us i think you should cover the face of the guy that does the stupid glare to us okay that's what i'm gonna speaking of are you averting your gaze i mean yeah but i have i have the cloak up i would like i my goal is to like throw it over get it

[Speaker 3]
i have not used my reaction and i have a few of those uh dice left um if you would like to do that without a disadvantage oh sure i mean are you throwing it now or are you throwing it next turn

[Speaker 2]
um if james will let me throw it this turn then i'd love to throw it this turn sure no cool all right what is that rule

[Speaker 1]
i'll let you make a sleight of hand check and add trap dice if you so wish because that seems pretty appropriate for

[Speaker 2]
this okay um i'll kind of think of how many trap dice i want to use

[Speaker 3]
be like me use them all

[Speaker 1]
uh just remove wait roll your check first and then you'll then you'll be able to put this bucket aside okay nice i think you got it i think i got it all right this guy's pretty blinded cool you guys are coming from the other

[Speaker 6]
round oh he's not immune to blinded that's

[Speaker 1]
hysterical fuck that guy all right that brings us to fix you have

[Speaker 3]
advantage by the way okay

[Speaker 5]
that's a hit that's a damage all right i'm gonna bonus action disengage

[Speaker 1]
opening up the next room there are two small door children here

[Speaker 6]
we're hugging each other look at this tiny little morty

[Speaker 1]
and looking at the uh the door that is currently getting broken open

[Speaker 6]
behind them oh my gosh here

[Speaker 4]
oh look at their little beard okay i can just barely see something

[Speaker 5]
poking through all right um i'm gonna yell back to the group we've got more incoming

[Speaker 2]
and that's my turn i should have just crawled through the vent too

[Speaker 1]
yeah that's okay are keeping it this whole turn

[Speaker 4]
you talk about crawling through vents huh um oh how do i get out of here i don't want to be here um all right um i'm gonna i guess i will i will attack um yeah you have advantage on this guy

[Speaker 3]
uh well this guy's blinded does she have advantage on both because this guy's blinded and then this guy's squeaked that's correct okay okay who's looking worse

[Speaker 1]
oh uh definitely the bodak the bodak has way fewer hit points

[Speaker 4]
this guy creamer or whatever the fuck he is yeah all right contact him 15 wait what's up does the 13 hit him

[Speaker 1]
because you have advantage ah right 18 18 does it awesome and add the b12 onto that

[Speaker 3]
right

[Speaker 4]
um and then i'll attack again toast oh he's dead oh perfect i'm gonna turn around and attack this fucker advantage on this guy too yes wonderful well 14 and go keep go keep this for it's your stab day mrs i get distracted by how ugly it is i just turn around and i'm just not

[Speaker 2]
prepared to see it you're just like oh oh i forgot how ugly you are he's really close to me

[Speaker 4]
i like how the hand is reaching out over the token border

[Speaker 3]
that is my favorite feature of a lot of things oh shit does an 18 succeed um 18 does not beat my 19 what was my damage again d8s okay it is a lot of d8s literally reaching out of

[Speaker 6]
the fucking token don't touch don't don't touch do not touch

[Speaker 3]
my minty shoulder

[Speaker 1]
okay no longer frightened and when does it roll to recharge all right i'm gonna start by attacking para for 43 it's gonna attack eevee or let's see here you have the 13 to 6 and then you take 26 on top of that 13 damage and 20 damage 26 so the 13 gets halved but i think that

[Speaker 3]
just takes you have i used my reaction this set so

[Speaker 1]
this round though you just had your the hell is half of 13 did he even have 13 you just have rounded down the six wait don't you have

[Speaker 4]
like three hit points yeah i don't even have to do math

[Speaker 3]
actually do i want to use that on her because it's probably got that one more action so i'll wait he'll go down again anyway

[Speaker 4]
yeah if um if the fight's almost over then might just need to stay down oh my god is that oh what is this it will recharge can somebody like rude take this guy down

[Speaker 3]
yeah hang on i gotta roll some let's see how many herb dice do i have left i've got this many uh that does not do it alas

[Speaker 1]
oh shoot

[Speaker 3]
and i can't add one to it damn oh well all right uh let's see here

[Speaker 1]
mimosa and that does take me down oh shit

[Speaker 2]
what happened i just went down oh oh no oh i didn't do i have to roll that yes you do you're in the you're in the

[Speaker 1]
thing pb is also unconscious

[Speaker 4]
getting a little catnap 54 damage we can't die this way

[Speaker 6]
uh-oh

[Speaker 1]
oh parrot this is dim light oh oh uh is it dim light that means let's see i i had 45 hit points oh yeah i had 45

[Speaker 4]
recover our bodies 54 hot chocolate and i came back to death

[Speaker 3]
okay so i have six left oh now i'm up by six i'm up by six excuse excuse me sir give me my

[Speaker 6]
bitch

[Speaker 1]
all right you can attempt to make a save intro for uh

[Speaker 3]
for keeping spirit guardians up uh yeah i have advantage on those things i don't know if that i don't know what the dcs are

[Speaker 1]
54 would be 27 probably yeah that would be way higher than what i could do

[Speaker 2]
these things suck they're fucking brutal

[Speaker 1]
holy shit they are we're gonna have to actually

[Speaker 2]
strategize it when we come against it next

[Speaker 1]
but that is the end of the series turn we come now to oh did you take the 54 damage yes yes i did i said i went down

[Speaker 2]
down i'm at zero out of 99

[Speaker 3]
uh well let's see let's see what do i got what do i got what do i got i uh do i trust katie oh well i'm gonna squeak it again i might as well um whatever you got um also mr dwarf never got on to the uh uh initiative order just so you know all right i'll have him

[Speaker 1]
yeah i've been reloading the last turn and then he'll just kill him

[Speaker 3]
all right let's see if i even get this one the foundry come on man like you have advantage against that was with advantage foundry is not happy with me when it comes to my own rolls for attacking how dare i waste a eighth level on a guiding bolt i guess

[Speaker 1]
and mr shotgun man is gonna roll for it he hits

[Speaker 6]
that's a natural choice

[Speaker 1]
oh he's just wants a piece of this thing skull and one of its eyes get thrown

[Speaker 3]
away oh yeah all right

[Speaker 1]
well it's still up damn it's got a fair chunk of it's about like uh a third right now just bloody do i have to make a death saving throw jordan cool that's a fail

yeah i have 15 potions of healing holy shit

[Speaker 5]
because i bought 15 potions of healing oh how is the devourer looking he said it was like a third of its health

[Speaker 2]
at this point we're gonna have to bring our secondary

[Speaker 5]
does that 13 hit the 13 does not hit all right um i am gonna bonus action disengage again and get over to para to figure out what the hell to do next all right i think that's the end of my turn

[Speaker 4]

you got the exact thing i did

[Speaker 6]
oh no character death maybe

[Speaker 1]
at the devourer okay does not recharge it's gonna attack the uh the dwarf twice just took out about a well about 30 points that was a low roll this thing's gonna miss that 32 is gonna take him down now all right that's his turn that brings us to para

[Speaker 3]
i am gonna mask your wounds that's six creatures in a 30 foot radius so i think that's pretty much everybody i'm gonna do this oh it's gonna make me do that everyone gets 34

[Speaker 6]

[Speaker 3]
uh and i'm let's see i think i actually still have a bonus action to use so i'm gonna squeak it again get squeaked get squeaked motherfucker why are those children prone

[Speaker 6]

[Speaker 2]
we're gonna run out of the city whistle to our elephants to close the gate I don't know which way does the gate just part yeah open or close is it open

[Speaker 1]
outwards so they can just push it shut it's open oh sorry it doesn't open it

[Speaker 2]
opens upwards oh of course it does by chains can we seal lever this again it's

[Speaker 1]
on the side of the gate well there's one for each side of the there's one for

[Speaker 2]
each side of the gate oh okay let's make it the rogues pass the children on and then go to the inside and as we're running out we just like do it we slide

[Speaker 1]
out or under or whatever alrighty sounds good all right all of the fucking caravan is like you know they're having tea they're having brunch and stuff like that not really sure what's going on and then the gate starts closing in front of them and they see a horde of undead approaching the fucking gate there's quite a bit of panic

[Speaker 6]
run run run go go go go go the war elephants are currently smashing against the gate trying

[Speaker 2]
to get at the fucking undead they're trying to fight yeah hairy elephante what a beast you guys okay Mimosa is gonna make a note on the door in Dwarvish and Elvish no don't open dead inside yeah I mean this is Mimosa she wouldn't do that she'd be appalled by that formatting yeah she's gonna make notes and are there any other languages we should

[Speaker 5]
account for Dwarvish I already did that right you didn't Dwarvish comment I already did that fixed Bix will put up a thieves can't say although such a good oh don't rob this if you value your life a leonin as well and sylvan she's never seen another leonin fucking this is the Rosetta stone this place is messed up I can write it in draconic and

[Speaker 2]
all the languages we know oh cool hey okay so I just realized we have three people which will even hold our loft we have three people what so we lost three people to the woods on our way here but we just gained three people so we're good let's get out of here before we worry about that okay this place is bad but we do lose three people come on let's get out of here okay three more people keep me suggests that we leave mm-hmm Mimosa suggests that we leave yeah so we leave oh and please please stay on the path don't go by it don't stray don't go near

[Speaker 1]
the forest let's go all righty so I think it's a pretty good spot to close down the session where are you folks intending on running next or or going next with the area's career we're still

[Speaker 5]
trying to find that dragon tower tower tower tower tower focus I thought I meant soul Greg oh no here is back home oh okay well we're not right your grandmother who has the had or has the tower new Greg that's where okay my confusion yeah I'm sorry soulful Greg has caught on

[Speaker 1]
so mad fear Ben's causeway what is that what Robin Robin is the is this part of the world's

[Speaker 4]
word for fear bulbs okay are they good typically who knows in this don't we know her bulk you do you well you know one mechanic so this is likely where whatever it is where the tower is whatever

[Speaker 1]
this is it's probably in the area somewhere the thing shows as the as like the bottom of the search area basically but the middle of the search area or wait no you were asking a party

[Speaker 4]
I'm confused now ignore is that anything this is probably where the tower is this is where I

[Speaker 2]
suspect the tower to be over with those sunshines yeah I thought it was in a desert so in this area

[Speaker 1]
no okay and it's connected to so the thing about being connected to a desert is that's where your

[Speaker 2]
grandmother was from originally oh okay I don't know I mean if we're going down then we're gonna pass through this so we'll hit all the spots unless you want to go up where do you think we are right

[Speaker 3]
here okay yeah that's where we are yes I know you're going down and going up I think she wants

[Speaker 1]
to so she'd be correct in assuming that the mountain so if you went further into the drawer fold there might be a way under the mountain but then you have drawer fold problems right now and your other way of going up would be oh use the freehand drawing or draw freehand and then you

[Speaker 2]
could just drag it to indicate what route you want to take okay let me find that real fast there is that's what I was thinking we would do okay because then we are gonna kind of hit the terrains but if we want to go the opposite way we can if we go that way we could make a stop at the

[Speaker 3]
firbolgs and see if they're trading cool get some potions or I was just gonna say also on our way

[Speaker 2]
maybe distribute a couple potions please oh yeah hoarding bitch what excuse me I bought them with my own money 15 though like yeah I wanted to be sure yes she was prepared but we had nothing I know I seriously thought I had one but I was remembering my other character otherwise I would

[Speaker 1]
have there's a close-up TPK since the night which was also a year ago pit fiends oh no you're right team was also pretty close yeah that was fun though why is it the only strong thing that they

[Speaker 2]
don't know my foundry is so bugged if I like move my mouth a little bit it shoots me all the way

[Speaker 1]
across I don't know it's just trying to delete the stupid circle I hate

[Speaker 2]
there's something beautiful about the vague dick shape hey I don't know how to get it off and I'm

[Speaker 1]
scared to try so gonna someone else do it this is caravan as you keep saying that I'm the only one I'm saying it sent it to me yeah I mean it's a session start one I shoot shit yesterday was

[Speaker 6]
Skyrim's anniversary oh did they release a new Skyrim we still have a month so you guys are

[Speaker 1]
arriving at this the same days that the other party is arriving at the rogue tower I guess we have a little bit of the time paradox because I think Bix was supposed to be with the road tower I don't know man yeah it doesn't matter this case of everyone was supposed to be a newbie

[Speaker 4]
characters get back from the newbie sesh characters get back from the newbie sesh

[Speaker 1]
that would be on the 10th of the next month which is or all right so we had a slight time time paradox who I forgot who was supposed to be there but that was a newbie sesh so who mm-hmm all right so how did that how did that go folks chaotically amazing for our characters it

[Speaker 3]
went pretty bad actually for the players I went this fucking great yeah atmosphere we almost died

[Speaker 1]
but first I'm trying to keep up with an appendix a dungeon time nothing but that non repo blue had the same color that they used I think old AD&D maps it was a color that or I got close to it a color that you basically could not run through a printer without it like spitting out some eldritch mess don't do that buddy all right folks I'm gonna get ready to go to bed anybody

[Speaker 4]
have any questions comments concerns no right now nothing thank you for running the session

[Speaker 1]
we have another one planned I don't think nobody has proposed one for this I will probably be

[Speaker 3]
proposing one for the same time next week yeah that's good um and you said what what date

[Speaker 2]
18th 18th all right I would assume that's seven days yep oh wait no yeah teens should be fine

[Speaker 3]
I thought for a moment that was gonna be Thanksgiving

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna go probably play Baldur's Gate

[Speaker 1]
posting their Baldur's Gate playthroughs in the fucking video games channel very annoyed I mean

[Speaker 4]
I have a bunch of characters that I've made but that's about it that's funny I've made a lot of

[Speaker 2]
characters and they're all the point that you were supposed to take less time making characters

[Speaker 3]
that's great yeah and they made it harder to make characters so people take even more time to get the way they want I see I downloaded mods to make pretty at all that too like they failed in every way they should have just given us like fucking sliders yeah anyway bye you guys bye

[Speaker 1]
night I can't believe I forgot that because I don't want to take XP away from Bix at the same time I could just let's hear it was in a collapsing wizard towers maybe I could just use that as the as the excuse got zapped away because she was also part of the other session from last night and Kyrona I could totally do in this in this caravan thing it was big specifically that was in our sesh crap well I've never been in the situation before I'll make a decision figure something out easy all right see y'all later did you man's I hope you had a fun time listening in with their shenanigans let me know when you complete your character and we'll have we'll get you your foundry server login I will see you folks later ready 90 90

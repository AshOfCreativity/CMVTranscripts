[Speaker 1]
I don't know what we're talking about, but that's such a mood.

[Speaker 3]
Been there, my friend.

[Speaker 1]
You know what I'm talking about. You know where I'm at.

[Speaker 3]
I think we have enough people tonight that I don't have to bring two characters.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you know, keep one in reserve just in case somebody dies. I was like, well, I didn't finish the map because I had a busier day than I needed to and also I was playing Helldivers, so naturally I just need, you know, I need something to be the starter fight, and what better than to have the Manticore come back?

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. We all bring all of our characters.

[Speaker 6]
It becomes a war fight. I have Wolvie only here for a bit. I need to duck off, but I might be back before you finish up.

I'm not sure.

[Speaker 3]
Abandoning us? Shame on you. Pretty much.

[Speaker 1]
So, we're going to follow up shortly after the Manticore attacks. I'm going to have everybody do exploration activities. I'm also going to add an encounter.

Oh, I flew through here. Amazing.

[Speaker 6]
Should I be bringing my level 2 character or my level 3 character?

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying to get all of my level 2.

[Speaker 7]
Is this a continue one from last session?

[Speaker 1]
The Manticore from last session? Yes, it will.

[Speaker 6]
If it's not going to be a problem, I would like to play as Nova, who is level 3.

[Speaker 1]
It's not going to be a problem at all, I mean, I think you should play as Nova.

[Speaker 6]
Rana is happy to not die.

[Speaker 1]
Your current characters can set up a camp, base camp or something like that, and can also take care of these poor civilians.

[Speaker 7]
Can someone please delete these tokens for me?

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck are you doing?

[Speaker 7]
I was doing that last night, I didn't think it would return to this page, and I wanted to make sure I fixed up all my tokens.

[Speaker 1]
Move them off to the side, you're still right next to a bunch of other tokens that are mine.

[Speaker 3]
They're all mine!

[Speaker 8]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I guess Manticore just goes to the center now.

[Speaker 2]
He's got two of the same guy.

[Speaker 7]
I don't think I fixed up the page. Yes. I feel accomplished.

My tokens are ready.

[Speaker 1]
Remember folks, please add yourselves to the party sheet.

[Speaker 6]
Oops, my bad.

[Speaker 8]
Um, did you guys...

[Speaker 2]
Did you guys fall on it? Hm? Looks like a lot of melee and not a spell cast.

[Speaker 5]
Veela is a witch.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll put in clink so that there is more spells going around. Maybe.

[Speaker 8]
It didn't work.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 5]
I thought for a moment that was a Peanuts.

[Speaker 8]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
Just my child asked me to open up an orange. I'm in London. Oh.

Are we in a forest?

[Speaker 1]
You sure are. Somebody catch up Nessie and anybody else who was not here last night.

[Speaker 5]
There's a pretty good recap in Session Reports by Landy.

[Speaker 6]
How dare you make Nessie read.

[Speaker 2]
I guarantee you it'll take me five minutes to read that if I do not get interrupted by my kids.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, now I've got this. So, Booch, Keeby, Nova, Susudio, and Rana set out from Bromloch-ish to the False Willow to fight some shit really. We encountered a bunch of gremlins at the start of the session and we beat the shit out of them.

One of the gremlins, who we didn't kill, told us about a little loot cache nearby. They gave us a letter that showed the instructions of how to find it. The letter was from someone who was in cohorts with House Baelor, the demon people.

We went and found the cache, it was near a one-eyed tree. We then met a unicorn, who was like, yeah, House Baelor sucks ass, you guys should fight them. You shouldn't be passive in this.

And we're like, hell yeah, that sounds great. Thanks, unicorn. And told us a bunch of stuff about the leader of House Baelor.

After that, we got lost because Nova was sensing direction. We ran into a manticore who was harassing a group of travelers. Most of them were dead, two of them were stranded under their wagon.

So we had a bit of an encounter where we tried to save them from death, which we did. And we have just regrouped from that. Okay.

Nova's back to scouting because she isn't useful. Sensing direction.

[Speaker 5]
Plankton's with us now?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Does Plank want to detect magic? Or...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, give me a moment. Let me at least see if he's got detect magic.

[Speaker 6]
Let's just not do any actions so we can move at full speed into any traps.

[Speaker 2]
I do not have detect magic. I am a level one psychic.

[Speaker 5]
I really wish these...

[Speaker 2]
Also, Plank really isn't the kind to go in prepared. What are we doing? Where are we going?

[Speaker 5]
Going to a big hole, right?

[Speaker 6]
A hollow?

[Speaker 2]
Big hole?

[Speaker 6]
We're going to the hollow.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the hollow!

[Speaker 6]
Same thing.

[Speaker 5]
I love the implication in this report that Rana is putting emojis onto parchment. Yes.

[Speaker 8]
Just little doodles.

[Speaker 6]
She'll, like, love-heart dot some of her eyes and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see if he does the white background or not. If there's a good chance he does the white background, that'll be okay.

[Speaker 3]
Do you think I could bring my rogue instead of Kibi? Uh... Siren.

I just finished, like, fully setting him up.

[Speaker 8]
I'm not opposed.

[Speaker 3]
The problem is I still have that 100 year old brandy, the 19 of it. And I don't exactly know what to do with it. Can I put it in the party stash and then...

[Speaker 2]
Leave it in Clint's bar.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, add 19 to...

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Add 19. When that's done... Then, um...

[Speaker 2]
I'll delete it. Wait, okay, what is it?

[Speaker 3]
The 100 year old brandy. I'm supposed to be selling it for someone. I don't remember who I'm selling it for.

[Speaker 2]
Put it in the party stash and I'll drag it over.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay. Move items. There you go.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, it is in his bar.

[Speaker 3]
How does dual wielding work? It does.

[Speaker 5]
You can use each weapon individually and use their traits differently.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
If you're on a low level, it's not that good.

[Speaker 7]
You do suffer a reduced multi-attack penalty. But later on when you start getting some feats, it reduces it further. Does it?

[Speaker 5]
Naturally reduce it? Or do you still need Agile?

[Speaker 7]
Still need Agile. Yeah, if you're going to duel with Agile weapons, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
If you're going to duel with two-handed weapons, it's not very much.

[Speaker 3]
Then what is a good weapon for a rogue?

[Speaker 5]
Daggers are default. Alright, everybody, add yourselves.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think anybody has... Or I don't think... I know there are still people who have not added themselves to the party sheet.

Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Move Kibi back. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
What about... Instead of daggers... Bow.

Bow and arrow.

[Speaker 6]
That's good.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. You're playing a rogue?

[Speaker 8]
I think you're...

[Speaker 2]
Nope, I was thinking a mach. Never mind. Yeah, that was good.

[Speaker 8]
Say y'all. Ow.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the Manticore is going to prioritize targets. In order of...

[Speaker 8]
Fuck you, Link.

[Speaker 1]
Add yourselves to the fucking initiative.

[Speaker 2]
You didn't say initiative. You said party... When did initiative come up?

[Speaker 1]
Party sheet and initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, she's been saying party sheet.

[Speaker 1]
And exploration activities.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. No, no, no.

[Speaker 1]
I think you guys heard me this time. Because I, for unknown reasons, it could be anything.

[Speaker 2]
I have two to three kids screaming around me.

[Speaker 1]
That's my excuse. You do have an excuse.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Urgh.

[Speaker 2]
She grabbed first, I saw you.

[Speaker 5]
Kibbe, we need Sairam in initiative. And Vur, we need Hujan in initiative.

[Speaker 3]
I thought I rolled him. What?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, wait. No, I'm dumb.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
Scared me. Two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five.

My own familiar is what's fucking me up here. Vur. Yeah?

Which needs initiative. Sorry, I thought I rolled it.

[Speaker 2]
You could have rolled perception instead of initiative.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I think that worked. Perfect. Sorry, it popped up the advantage in normal thing.

And it went behind one of the many windows I have open.

[Speaker 6]
Sasudio is missing from initiative, too.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I added him. Did I drag him away?

[Speaker 7]
Would this be considered a new day?

[Speaker 1]
This is not a new day from... You already had a new day. So, we're picking up where we left off, basically, with the manticore.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay, Sasudio is not playing right now.

[Speaker 3]
I could bring him if I'm allowed to.

[Speaker 1]
You guys, to set the scene, you guys were moving along. Setting up camp for the man and woman that you rescued from the carriage. Fleeing from the manticore.

Just very, very, very upset. Was initially scared away by Nova. But now it's back for revenge.

The characters that you guys are not adding to the combat moved ahead to set up camp. And then a hedge closed in behind them. And behind you.

Locking you into this... Locking you into this wider... Not quite a clearing.

There's only a little hole throughout the top. But there is a little bit more flight room for the manticore itself. I mean, it's gonna spawn in right about here.

I'm going to draw some freehand. These little zones here are just showing whether or not the manticore or anything else can fly in there. On account of the...

well, any kind of large critters can fly. So, that is my shitty map for the day. And then the green here is the actual walls.

Oh, the green, as opposed to the other green.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything.

[Speaker 1]
That was really nice of you. That would have taken an amount of restraint I would not be able to mess around on any day of the week. Riding atop the open canopy is the newly knighted jinkin that you guys fought the other day.

With two wands in hand. Oh, can I roll? Wait, I could roll stealth for this guy.

No, there's no stealth for this, because fucking hedge closed it. I wonder if something bad is about to happen. Alright, beginning the encounter.

Anybody not on the encounter list is now no longer able to access. And the manticore gets to go. So, he's gotta fly 20 feet down.

It's no problem for him. Who was the last one to roll initiative? Ah.

Hooch hiding dangerously close to the open sunlight.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, doesn't sound like me trying to avoid notice.

[Speaker 1]
Does not appear to have worked. We got one action for stride.

[Speaker 6]
It's only half speed, sorry, you can move twice as fast moving vertically down. You can move twice, it's half speed moving vertically up.

[Speaker 1]
If I wanted to fly 80 feet into the ground, I could take a lot of fall damage. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no, you don't take fall damage if you're using the fly action. So the fly is the air equivalent of stride. If something is flying, it needs to spend a fly action each turn to maintain its flight.

But this thing's coming down to kill us, so not necessary right now.

[Speaker 1]
So off with a succulent goblin meal. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Bro's dead. He's so dead. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait, sorry, that was a... That was a regular. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a way out?

[Speaker 6]
How much health does Hooch have? Hooch has like 24. He survives this.

Barely.

[Speaker 1]
You just gotta thrash this Hooch and then throw some down. Who's next? Alright, and who else...

Who's next in the order of initiative?

[Speaker 8]
Saren?

[Speaker 6]
My initiative goes up before his now? Yes, Vage moves to above the Manticore on initiative.

[Speaker 7]
I am the first in combat now.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a... Oh, Jesus Christ. That's his second stride action.

[Speaker 8]
Or fly action. Gonna die.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, is there some kind of way I can look for a way out?

[Speaker 8]
Is that an option?

[Speaker 3]
What?

[Speaker 1]
What was your exploration activity, if you chose one? I did not choose one. So you could do a stick to look for one out.

I can tell you right now, at present it appears as though the only... The only obvious way out is up through that little slice of open canopy.

[Speaker 3]
And it's how high? 20 feet?

[Speaker 1]
No, so 20 feet is like the limit of... Technically, yes.

[Speaker 3]
I can fly 15 feet.

[Speaker 1]
20 feet to reach the top.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, good lord. Okay, well, we're gonna go... How far can I go?

20 feet? Okay. 20...

20 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Importantly, the open canopy is this way.

[Speaker 3]
And that is... He can't get me there, or he can?

[Speaker 1]
No, that is the hole. If you would like him to not be able to fly and get you, there are these other places around.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. And then I can shoot him.

[Speaker 1]
I wouldn't say no.

[Speaker 3]
But I don't think I will. I just want him to leave me alone.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to spend an afternoon like we're called Knowledge, or if you want to look for something, or... Like, that's... It's a three-action system.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I want to look for a weak point so that we can get the hell out of here. Without having to fly.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sure. Make a... Either Recall Knowledge, or a Seek, or...

If you have a different action that you think would be more appropriate here.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna do Seek.

[Speaker 1]
Are the best at Seek in the party. Interesting. Okay, so you see that, uh...

You're looking around, and you see two things. One, you can see a little bit of a green, sparkly, like, green-yellow... It's almost like a piss-yellow glow that's very, very subtle.

Almost looks like a gas that's traveling up between the, uh... A glittery gas traveling up between the... The seams of where the hedge closed in behind your friends.

That same glow... Yeah, yeah, right up top there. That same glow is around the manticore's eyes.

And it's around the... It's around the cape. Kind of like it's a clasp.

Beautiful. Crude. Still somehow beautiful.

That's around Ser Jalin.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, so there's a... There's a something right here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's a glow on the manticore's eyes, on the hedge over here, and on Ser Jalin's cape.

[Speaker 3]
Does that tell me what it is?

[Speaker 1]
Not with a Seek.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, okay, well I'm gonna just point that out. Like, there's something glowing. Really secret, like, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Finding hidden creatures. It's not like the general perception check. I mean, kind of, but like...

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well I'm gonna point that out to the party.

[Speaker 6]
And I don't think I can do anything else, really, other than get away from that floating thing, because I'm squishy. Pointing something out is an action. Is it?

Okay, well then that's my action. Great. That's my third action.

Specifically to stealth, but I think that's an appropriate use of it, too.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 6]
To identify magic, it is a ten-minute activity that you would need to take. Your feats to be better at it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Closest you can get is like a quick recall knowledge or something like that, I think. Oh, Ser Jalin!

What does this person think? Uh, he is racist against birds.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, nice! I always forget about that.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Who's fucking... Was that your parakeet that just went...

[Speaker 3]
Wasn't mine.

[Speaker 2]
No, it was probably one of my children.

[Speaker 3]
That bird is asleep.

[Speaker 9]
Dude, stop. Help.

[Speaker 1]
I said it was held in a sentence. Is there a connection now? No, it doesn't show up in actions?

Okay, fine. Give me that thing. I think it did not work.

Sorry, folks, give me just a moment.

[Speaker 2]
It's all good.

[Speaker 8]
And then? Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Feature items can't be added to this actor. There is no way for me to cast a spell. It won't let me override it under any circumstances.

[Speaker 5]
Does he have a spellcasting trait? He does need one to use a wand.

[Speaker 1]
What's the specific trait?

[Speaker 6]
He needs to be able to cast a spell to use a wand, so he'd need a spellcasting feature. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's as thick as I have one.

[Speaker 2]
You know, if you just handed it to me, I'd cast it for you.

[Speaker 5]
You could probably force animal allies into that spellcasting feature to be a quick solve.

[Speaker 1]
No, because it's just an innate spell. It doesn't have... Yeah, if somebody has precise health that they can give me with this, I would be in your debt forever.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, what's the problem?

[Speaker 1]
So I'm trying to get this guy to be able to cast a spell.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe we can add a spellcasting entry?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It still says lacks proficiency.

[Speaker 6]
Maybe give him a scroll. No, you'd still need the...

[Speaker 1]
The scroll also does not work.

[Speaker 5]
I tried that last session.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Is his normal spellcasting list primal?

[Speaker 1]
I added an arcane.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Animal allies is on the primal list only. It's not on the arcane list.

We can't use that one unless he has a primal spellcasting.

[Speaker 1]
That's still not working.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, you know what? Oh god, that is not supposed to be there.

[Speaker 1]
Let's add this. I'm going to close him, and I'm going to bring him back out. And let's see if that works.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you have to give the manticore... You have to give the manicure the spell.

[Speaker 8]
Go off only.

[Speaker 2]
I asked about her. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's versus clink.

[Speaker 2]
No!

[Speaker 8]
What the fuck? No!

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is the manticore casting spell. This is Sir Yellen.

[Speaker 7]
Curt of Ass. Is it animation where it comes out from the target? Not from the person?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, emanation comes from him.

[Speaker 7]
So everyone around him gets affected by it, not like you can target it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, good point. I will have him... Jump.

[Speaker 6]
If you were here, you could hit hooch. Yeah, he's got one. Land it!

[Speaker 5]
You can knock it down to player if you want.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to eat that. Clink's going to eat that thing.

[Speaker 1]
And then, clink, what do you take? Half damage?

[Speaker 2]
From basic? I would assume so.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Meow. Owie! Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, well, that's his turn.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. Viola!

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 2]
You need to move it back to Viola because it's on clink.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's on Viola right now on my end.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Good eye.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't lie! I have proof. Totally lie.

I'm just lagging or some shit.

[Speaker 5]
Viola is going to command hope to fly. Hope has 40 foot fly speed. It'll fly over here.

And she is going to... She's going to cast evil eye, targeting Sir Yollen. She's going to need a will save from him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that doesn't work. Hm?

[Speaker 3]
Are we all good? He failed.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, sweet. So he gets sickened one as long as I sustain the spell.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Yeah, the little 14 is at the very bottom.

[Speaker 5]
Take a stride over here. Oh, I see it now.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, it's hidden. On the thing. The little thing popped up to tell me it was a failure.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it's not visible at all. Also, he can't wretch as long as I can see him.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Oh. I had to restart it.

Lost the shoot. That little bird is a... That little lizard is a piece of shit.

And how good is your weapon? Eh, it's close enough.

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to eat it. Eventually. Um...

Right now.

[Speaker 8]
But that's my first one. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
15 foot cone.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, dang it! Okay.

[Speaker 6]
You could hit Manticore with that or...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

[Speaker 6]
Hit the Manticore and Hooch.

[Speaker 5]
Wow.

[Speaker 2]
I think I'll just hit the Manticore.

[Speaker 7]
Everyone's had a chance to hit Hooch, but they're not... feeling some love in my heart.

[Speaker 2]
Why would I hit Hooch?

[Speaker 5]
Your heart feels warm.

[Speaker 2]
Just because you look ugly doesn't mean you should get your ass kicked.

[Speaker 5]
It's rare to find a goblin who bathes, so we gotta... We gotta keep care of this one.

[Speaker 2]
Jam... Oh, I accidentally targeted Sir Yotlin. But, um...

The Manticore needs to make us a gang throw. A basic fortitude, say. Needs to be to 16.

Who is making a thing? I made a cone. And I accidentally had the stupid lizard...

That's not a lizard. It looked like a chameleon from far away. My bad.

But I'm targeting the Manticore. And it needs to make a 16 fortitude save.

[Speaker 8]
Let's restore this poor creature's health.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you made it. Yeah. Okay, fine.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, what did Sir Yotlin do? Anyways.

[Speaker 2]
Because I had him... I accidentally had him targeted, still.

[Speaker 1]
Oops. So he just, what, takes the damage?

[Speaker 2]
I... Hold it... Still, so...

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait, a basic, so...

[Speaker 2]
No. Him deals with a basic save. I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
Does the, um... Manticore have a plus 8 bonus over the... Gremlin, though?

I guess that would be a crit.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Oh! Yes.

He has plus 16 to fortitude, so...

[Speaker 2]
Alright, nevermind. Nothing happens. Uh, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Nova!

[Speaker 6]
I was going to hit the gremlin.

[Speaker 1]
Well, this isn't like a sustained failure.

[Speaker 8]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 6]
He's still alive. I think these guys had a bit more health. Uh, sparking my transcendence lets me use my epithet.

I can stride half my speed in a straight line towards one enemy of my choice. That is a straight line. Here I am.

Uh, with my third action I will smack the, uh, gremlin again, though. Whoops, that should have had multi-tech penalty, minus 5. It's a crit miss, probably.

Yeah. Now it's my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Hooch! Alright, time for hooch to shine! Death save.

Uh, it's not letting me use roll a recovery save.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, you're not dying, you're only unconscious. You need to add dying to your token.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, how do I add dying?

[Speaker 6]
Someone has done it for you.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, it didn't let me do a stealth one. What? Nevermind.

No, like, secret? Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. You gotta have death checks with secret. It really adds to suspense.

[Speaker 3]
Try to sneak away from death's door.

[Speaker 5]
That sounds like a legendary stealth feat.

[Speaker 3]
Are you able to hero point yet?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, you can spend all of your hero points to stabilize.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah, I guess I'll do that. Uh, do I recover?

[Speaker 6]
The trigger is specifically a dying level increases, which it just has.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Uh, how do I use my hero point to stabilize?

[Speaker 6]
If you just right click your hero point to make it disappear on your sheet, and then set your dying to zero.

[Speaker 5]
Got to reset my hero point, thank you. Oh no, that added it.

[Speaker 6]
Now you will be wounded one.

[Speaker 4]
Hm. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Link, you don't have one.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. What? Link has three right now.

Okay. Do what?

[Speaker 5]
Hero points.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Okay, how many should we have?

[Speaker 5]
One. One.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 7]
You always start off the session with one.

[Speaker 2]
Not every game. Hello. No, it is lagging.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it's flanking me, sad.

[Speaker 7]
It is flanking, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know if it's going down.

[Speaker 7]
I don't think that matters.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, get second characters and drop them in.

[Speaker 3]
Right. Wait.

[Speaker 1]
I have two more actions left. Fuck, what do I do now?

[Speaker 8]
Kill this merc.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to bite you. Did you make the... I don't know how that save goes.

[Speaker 6]
What save? Sorry?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, there's a save for Manticore Venom.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, can you just ping the feature, maybe?

[Speaker 1]
It should still be up there.

[Speaker 6]
I don't see it in the Stinger attack.

[Speaker 1]
Weird.

[Speaker 6]
In the Venom part, there will be a chat sign next to the save. If you click the chat, it will post it to chat for me to click.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, did I need to do a save against the poison too? You didn't get hit by the Stinger.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Did that work? I think I clicked the poison.

[Speaker 6]
That's a sad roll. So I go to stage one, I take a D10 poison, and I'm enfeebled for one round.

[Speaker 5]
Of course.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, it's got two more actions.

[Speaker 1]
It does. So I already went after Siren. I'm going after Nova.

In order to do these things. Clink is next.

[Speaker 2]
Aww. There was like a split second where I was like, wow, it's my turn already?

[Speaker 7]
Nah.

[Speaker 2]
There's nothing wrong with being a Tengu!

[Speaker 1]
It'll actually never be your turn again.

[Speaker 8]
I'm gonna die! Oh no! You pissed in your coffee today, James.

Sorry, Clink. Clink is gonna get to level two! That's all I want!

[Speaker 6]
Clink isn't dying when he's dead. Massive damage just killed him.

[Speaker 1]
How does massive damage work?

[Speaker 6]
If you deal more than double their health in one attack.

[Speaker 8]
Oh no!

[Speaker 6]
Someone said how to preserve Clink!

[Speaker 8]
I just wanna go to level two!

[Speaker 6]
Alright, you've got another action. Did that have multi-attack penalty?

[Speaker 1]
It... let me double check.

[Speaker 6]
I can't see it's bonus, so I don't know if it did. I'm not doubting you or anything, I'm just trying to save Clink. No, it did not!

Clink, buddy!

[Speaker 5]
Wouldn't have been a crit.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, no, it did have... Guys, I'm sorry. It did have multi-attack penalty.

It's a plus 17 modifier.

[Speaker 6]
I see. Sorry, Clink.

[Speaker 1]
And then, I think Viola's next in order, so I'm gonna have him take flight.

[Speaker 6]
Clink's turn would move to above the manacles. Oh no, Clink's out! Clink's gone.

[Speaker 8]
No, I'm dead!

[Speaker 2]
I am a dead bird!

[Speaker 1]
Siren!

[Speaker 3]
Alright, two actions to get to... Actually, no. We're gonna...

We're gonna go here. Yeah. And then I can do that again.

Okay. Well, that's it. That's my...

Those are my actions.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we hit him. Sir Yellen.

[Speaker 6]
Please... He's holding two wands. He doesn't have a melee weapon.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he doesn't have a melee weapon. I gotta... I gotta get rid of one of these wands.

I already used it.

[Speaker 6]
You can use it one twice. It just has a chance of breaking the second time.

[Speaker 1]
I don't wanna break it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
He def... He definitely doesn't work. He's a fuckin' gremlin.

Uh... Viola, what was the last action that you took?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, stride. Last turn, I commanded... Uh...

Oh. I... Oops.

Used an evil eye on Sir Yellen.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's just the last action that you took. That's... Which is stride.

I'd say the DC is one.

[Speaker 8]
What's that? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I think she'll work.

[Speaker 5]
Deja vu is the whole turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. He hasn't done anything yet, so...

[Speaker 6]
Is it an action to activate the wand? Oh. Yeah.

It's a two-action spell. Is he targeting?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he's targeting Viola. Uh... Viola, just make me a...

Just make me... What is this? Uh, will save?

[Speaker 6]
Will save. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Secret, or do you want it public?

[Speaker 8]
Public.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, dog. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
It's just if the target fails, so... No effect. That is his entire turn.

Viola!

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I would like to not be inside of this manticore in the next 30 seconds. Viola's going to stride.

Or is this difficult terrain? The thick canopy, or is it just the... No, it's just no flight.

No other effects. Gonna go here. Uh, can she investigate this wall of hedges?

[Speaker 8]
Sure.

[Speaker 5]
All right, should I recall knowledge?

[Speaker 4]
That's fine.

[Speaker 5]
Nothing. All right, and she'll sustain the sickness on Sir Yolen. Technically triggers hope, but it doesn't do anything right now.

[Speaker 2]
Coink!

[Speaker 6]
He's dead.

[Speaker 2]
I'm dead. Nova!

[Speaker 6]
Nova just cries out, Stop fucking around and kill the gremlin! She's gonna try and hit it. Please die.

Near death.

[Speaker 1]
You have two more actions.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, sorry. Did the manticore have its turn? No, not yet.

Okay, um... I will demoralize him. To try and lower his AC.

Nice. And with my last action, I will hit it. With a crit!

Thank god.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
How do you want to do this?

[Speaker 6]
Slice it in half. You're a fucking idiot for coming back here, you dickhead.

[Speaker 1]
Die. The body just kind of fades back into the Feywild. Uh, two halves.

Both butthurt.

[Speaker 6]
Get out of here, manticore! Fuck off!

[Speaker 1]
There's wands and... That is my turn. Cloak.

Uh, fall to the ground. And the effect on the manticore has been... Dispelled.

Additionally, The hedge opens up.

[Speaker 6]
Can we take the moment of confusion the manticore has to pick up clink and get out of here?

[Speaker 1]
I feel like we're still in the initiative, you know?

[Speaker 6]
Fuck!

[Speaker 2]
Clink is definitely the one that dies with his tongue hanging out.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, weird.

[Speaker 1]
No, I wasn't supposed to be clicked on hooch.

[Speaker 6]
Hooch just fucking dies.

[Speaker 1]
It's a D-100 for you.

[Speaker 2]
Join me! Join me in the afterlife.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, hooch, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 6]
Just stabilize, bro. Oh, you did stabilize. You're fine.

You're at zero. Hedge doesn't get a turn either. It is the manticore's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hooch is muted at the moment. Uh, the manticore... It's fine.

The manticore loses morale. See you, Nova. Again.

Remembering last time. Immediately. Stay in the way.

Wait. Uh, do we have any party level ones?

[Speaker 8]
Me! And you failed me!

[Speaker 3]
Siren. I'm immediately trading out. He's going back to camp.

[Speaker 1]
Siren does get to...

[Speaker 3]
I was gonna bring him to, like... I was gonna bring him because we were going to, like, a fey hollow, but, like, I don't think that's a good idea. I'm bringing Kiwi.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, the manticore's gone now? Why are you...? I'm scared.

[Speaker 5]
He's gone now.

[Speaker 1]
And you just got a bunch of XP.

[Speaker 5]
My elixirs of life... There it is.

[Speaker 8]
Woo!

[Speaker 5]
I get to level up! Nova is also level one. R.I.P. Clank.

[Speaker 1]
How is this the first XP Siren's gotten?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, because I haven't used him.

[Speaker 1]
Like, at all. You gotta just use him tonight. Alright, now...

That really sucks.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, can you... Sorry, that's for me? Thank you.

Um, I'll give you one back to replace it. It's thanks.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Does only Siren get the double XP?

[Speaker 6]
Viola should.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, is Viola level one?

[Speaker 5]
Clank too. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I did ask.

[Speaker 5]
I did say.

[Speaker 1]
I did not hear. But I believe you. Minus...

Four, six, zero.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I have added... Equipment to...

I've added equipment to the party sheet. From Sir Yolen.

[Speaker 6]
He doesn't have, like, a Breath of Life scroll, does he?

[Speaker 1]
Nah, you're gonna have to... Get, like, a Fey Lord or something like that.

[Speaker 5]
Viola immediately wants to lay claim to the Wand of Deja Vu. Like good Americans.

[Speaker 1]
I will let you folks, uh, discuss amongst yourselves.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Viola's only looking to Viola. Viola's only looking to Nova for approval on whether to take the Wand of Deja Vu.

[Speaker 6]
Nova doesn't care. Nova pays no attention. She's like...

Trying to... She's like... Shaking, like, Clank, buddy, no!

[Speaker 3]
Siren picks up a single feather. Like, oh my god. It's...

[Speaker 2]
You know, shaking Clank and, like, all of... Like, a lot of his... Random gems and shit start falling out of his bag.

I think it's two forks and spoons.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 6]
Nova's a hysterical mess. She's like... Snotty and teary and...

[Speaker 3]
Uh, can we... Can we put them back together? I...

[Speaker 5]
That's a lot of pieces.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, your secondary characters have come back to the... Have come back to the scene. Telling you that they found the entrance to the False Widow Hollow.

This is also Nessie's opportunity to add... To bring in a different character. Wait, it's so good!

[Speaker 2]
Wait, I'll get Monk leveled up before he dies.

[Speaker 8]
I thought that stuff would be cool.

[Speaker 5]
Clank died in a combat that he leveled up, so ghost dedication would be fucking hilarious. It's so funny.

[Speaker 6]
If anyone's got unfinished business, it would be Clank.

[Speaker 8]
I'm just...

[Speaker 7]
I have many, uh... Many bearers here.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, jeez.

[Speaker 7]
Would it be mean if... Clank was ghost dedication, and then you threw a gold coin to him, and they couldn't pick it up? Did he have more than gold?

[Speaker 1]
What is the ghost dedication?

[Speaker 7]
It's so funny.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 7]
You die to return to the ghost.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on. Clank has to come back as a ghost. Hold on, just give that to Clank, and then come back.

You don't even need to bring him back. Does that thing, like, rise out of his body? Like, what the...

I'm back!

[Speaker 8]
Please! Please!

[Speaker 6]
There is a way for you guys... Clank's a legacy character. He gets the red jacks for free.

Is Clank a legacy character?

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 2]
I don't actually know what that means. But I'm assuming you know.

[Speaker 6]
No, from the previous campaign.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
No. Monk and Mimosa are. But...

You died and returned as a ghost.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
How much of standing around do we have, like, at least 10 minutes? I'm probably gonna get to full health, if that is the case.

[Speaker 5]
That fucking scar.

[Speaker 7]
So, uh, if Clink is dead, what are the rules in play, Alec?

[Speaker 8]
Right?

[Speaker 6]
Neva's not letting any of you near Clank.

[Speaker 3]
So glad Kibi wasn't here. She'd be a fucking mess.

[Speaker 5]
Teal's trying to figure out what she's gonna tell Weissmark.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. He was a scrungly dude, but he had people who liked him.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 5]
This is gonna be so much paperwork. I... I just...

I just got the tavern in his name. Neva, does Clank have any next of kin?

[Speaker 6]
I... I don't know. I'm so sad.

[Speaker 5]
Can you, like, write me a letter when you're not? This is info I need.

[Speaker 9]
Thanks.

[Speaker 3]
Aaron's just like, well, shit, that's... that's not how today was supposed to go. He's definitely...

he seems okay right now, but he's definitely... tonight, when everyone's asleep, gonna have a meltdown.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
What size category was... was Clank in?

[Speaker 8]
Medium.

[Speaker 3]
Was? I don't like this.

[Speaker 2]
He's still currently the size. He's medium. Medium, okay.

[Speaker 5]
There's a medium corpse on the ground.

[Speaker 2]
Excuse me?

[Speaker 5]
That is a joke. For legal lore reasons, that's a joke.

[Speaker 2]
You'll come back in to haunt your ass.

[Speaker 5]
That's how he gets no skin.

[Speaker 2]
And now Clank's unfinished business is... I mean, just pick one. He's got a lot of unfinished business.

[Speaker 9]
Are they even finished business? Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Make a summoner and have the Adol and be Clank. Is that devotion or anger?

[Speaker 5]
Probably devotion to the...

[Speaker 3]
If one of my fairy characters dies, do they... I remember you said something about fairies, like... or fey, kind of going back where they were from, or like if they die, they just kind of go back to the Feywild?

Or something like that? Is it the same for little sprites?

[Speaker 6]
I think, James, it's muted.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Your mouth is moving, but there's no sound coming out. Oh, we heard that.

[Speaker 1]
I'm audible again, right?

[Speaker 8]
Yes. Alright.

[Speaker 6]
I know that Fey and Pathfinder, they go back to the Feywild and reform after a period of time.

[Speaker 3]
I was asking about if my characters die, do they do that, or do they just die?

[Speaker 1]
I think they can... Oh, yeah, so, sorry. You can hear me, that's right.

Yes, she can come back.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. But not if they die in the Feywild.

[Speaker 5]
They die in the Feywild. It gets complicated there.

[Speaker 3]
Because that would be really funny if if they do come back and Charis was just mourning for like a year over her brother who just reformed, and she had no idea. Just assumed he was dead, dead.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if we need another spellcaster, I can bring in Granny Agnes. I just have to fill in her stupid spells.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, this wand would have been uncharged currently. Let me fix that.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be here for. Nova is very sad about what happened, though. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We might be able to, we could just entrust Plink's body with Nova then.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Nova will take care of them.

[Speaker 5]
Carrying them one last time. Oh, you guys didn't hear me either.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm down to take a short break to get you guys to if you guys need it for deciding on what to do. Oh, am I back?

[Speaker 8]
You're back, you're back.

[Speaker 5]
We, uh Are we to continue then? I think we have. Or do we turn back?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, we have to continue, but somebody needs to take care of Plink.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, Nova's gonna do that because I'm not sure when I need to leave, so it will be quite soon, though, so Nova has been demoted from party folder to my folder, and maybe if, when I get back you guys are still going, I'll Nova will be dealing with that on. Plink should probably be removed from the party as well.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

[Speaker 5]
Do we have a folder for dead characters?

[Speaker 2]
He's not dead!

[Speaker 5]
He's a little dead.

[Speaker 8]
He's only a little dead, okay?

[Speaker 5]
He's a little dead.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, man. Psychics do not have a lot of health.

[Speaker 3]
How much health did Plink have? Thirteen! Okay, so, yeah, I was I was good to run.

[Speaker 2]
The minigame that I made has seventeen. So that's cool.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Siren has fifteen, which is why I was like you're not getting the fuck out of there.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Seen forty on damage dice.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I got hit by forty too.

[Speaker 5]
How the fuck do you live? You live with two, I guess. Yeah, I put in for health.

Whoa! Robo mode.

[Speaker 6]
Australian internet moment.

[Speaker 7]
I was just up like this. Should be good now.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Okay. Nova, we can treat you with this force.

[Speaker 2]
I wish there was a fast button that would transfer all the spells to this prepared spell list.

[Speaker 7]
Um, if you do the prepared list um, you then just I don't do it, I don't do it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there we go. I have everything. Um.

Alright, so What are we doing? I mentioned earlier I was okay to take a ten minute break but like, uh, I don't think anybody heard me or what happened.

[Speaker 5]
We discussed in character the plan.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 8]
So we can take No.

[Speaker 5]
Nova's taking Klink's body back.

[Speaker 8]
Uh. Uh.

[Speaker 1]
Oops, sorry, I almost called you Mimosa. Let's see.

[Speaker 8]
Uh-huh.

[Speaker 1]
You are a free monk already.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and if we need an extra person I've got Granny Agnes.

[Speaker 3]
And I'm sure Karis would also love to join. Kibi would also love to join.

[Speaker 1]
Karis is just getting back to brown monk at this point, right?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but you are out. Like, time out. We're out.

Fuck.

[Speaker 2]
I'll do food.

[Speaker 8]
That's what's gonna happen.

[Speaker 2]
I guess that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this time we're going to actually take a ten minute break so I can get food.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Landy, if you need to bounce, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, cheers.

[Speaker 8]
Alright, see you soon, brother. Bye.

[Speaker 4]
The other day, I was watching this movie called Mystic River. It's about the murder of a young woman called Katie Markham and the two detectives who find her killer. And it's fascinating to see these guys do their job.

The movie goes into quite considerable detail about how these detectives crack the case, and so we see them conducting interviews, chasing down leads, and figuring things out by going through the facts.

[Speaker 1]
What makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know, maybe something in the street? Maybe.

[Speaker 4]
And as I was watching, I started to think about how you could turn this into a video game. Of course, there have already been plenty of detective games, from classic point-and-click adventures like KGB, to murder mystery side quests for Assassin's Creed, to full-blown detective adventures like Murdered Soul Suspect. But few of them have really scratched that itch for me.

It's very rare that I'll get completely involved in one of these games. You know, really turning the clues and witness statements around in my brain as I work towards that all-important eureka moment that defines so much of detective fiction. It just doesn't really happen.

So in this video, I want to try and figure out what makes a good detective game. How do developers come up with interesting mechanics that really let players unleash their inner Sherlock? But to achieve this, I think we first need to go back to Mystic River and look at how these two detectives crack the case so we can figure out the best way to turn these investigation processes into video game mechanics.

First, the detectives gather information. They get clues from the crime scene, like the slug from the bullet that killed Katie, a list of phone numbers for hotels from her backpack, and a 911 call to the police.

[Speaker 1]
DETECTIVE 2 Son, what's your name? Your name, son. What's your name?

[Speaker 4]
Plus, they question people, like Katie's parents, her friends, and a woman who witnessed the crime.

[Speaker 3]
Let it stop. And someone said hi.

[Speaker 4]
Someone said hi?

[Speaker 3]
Hi.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so this stuff is pretty easy to pull off in a game, right? L.A. Noire, for example, managed evidence collection just fine, with 3D objects that you can spin and manipulate. And Condemned had some cool gadgets to reveal fingerprints and bloodstains in the crime scene.

Plus, loads of games have dialogue trees for talking to people, and we see those crop up in detective games all the time, so that's no issue either. It's the next bit that's really tricky. So the movie then shows the real detective work, as the two cops work the case.

We see them expose people's lies. When Katie's friends say she wasn't dating anyone, Divine brings up the hotel phone numbers.

[Speaker 1]
The 19-year-old girl doesn't go to Las Vegas alone, so...

[Speaker 5]
Who is she going with?

[Speaker 3]
Brendan.

[Speaker 5]
Brendan Harris?

[Speaker 4]
Brendan Harris, yeah. So the information also lets them follow leads. They can now talk to Brendan Harris for one thing.

Plus, the ballistics on the slug match a gun that was used in a liquor store hold-up during the 80s, so let's go check that out. I know who did it. Name was Ray Harris.

He used to call him just Ray. Next, the cops can find connections between the evidence. Ray Harris is obviously related to Brendan Harris.

Time to call him in for further questioning.

[Speaker 2]
Why do you keep asking me if my father had a gun?

[Speaker 1]
The gun that killed your girlfriend was the same gun your father used at a robbery 18 years ago.

[Speaker 4]
And finally, the detectives can make deductions. By looking at the current information from a different perspective...

[Speaker 1]
She doesn't hear a scream. She hears a gunshot, before that a high, which tells me the Markham girl is either very friendly or she knew him.

[Speaker 4]
...or by making logical arguments. He said her name.

[Speaker 5]
She's a dead girl. You refer to her as a she. Yeah, but how does a kid know that?

[Speaker 9]
The girl is dead in the park. How does he know that the blood in the car came from a woman?

[Speaker 4]
Now, detective games have tried to turn all of this stuff into gameplay. But one of the most common ways of representing it is through simple, multiple-choice questions. Look at this bit in Telltale's The Wolf Among Us, where Bigby picks up evidence, and then the player gets to answer a question about the clue's significance.

[Speaker 8]
What? What are you thinking?

[Speaker 4]
This is the same dress as the one in the book about Snow. I think Smith was dressing Lily up in it. A similar thing happens in Sherlock Holmes' Crimes and Punishment, when you're questioning people.

At specific points, a button will appear on screen, allowing you to uncover a lie in the witness's statement, and pick the response that will reveal their mistruth. I don't think this works at all, because the player is completely prompted by the potential answers. They're not coming up with their own thoughts, so much as simply looking for the answer that sounds most sensible.

Or, in some cases, just guessing. Get the answer wrong in Sherlock Holmes, and you'll be told to give it another try. But I think this shows the real game design challenge of making a detective game.

Because the very act of testing whether the player has figured stuff out can inadvertently give away the answer, which removes pretty much any sense of satisfaction when you get it right. You connected the evidence, says Telltale. Ooh, go me.

I'm awesome. Anyway. One way that games have fixed this multiple choice problem is by simply giving way more potential answers.

Look at this deduction screen in the game Detective Grimoire. It's very similar to the one in The Wolf Among Us, really. At a specific point in the game, Grimoire will need you to answer a question about the events at hand.

GRIMOIRE Have I uncovered a secret in you? But instead of picking a single answer, you have to create a thought by smushing together a number of disparate ideas. And with eight different pictures to put in two slots, and two pickers with four statements each, thanks to the magic of combinatorial explosion, there are a whopping 896 possible combinations.

Meaning that while it still prompts you a fair bit, at least randomly guessing is out of the equation.

[Speaker 8]
That little girl, is it warm enough for my beard to have happened? Uh, no.

[Speaker 4]
Another example can be found in the Android game The Trace, where you answer questions by dragging on the clues and observations you have picked up. Because you often need multiple answers for each question, it's much harder to simply guess your way through the game. For lies, the Ace Attorney games have a good system, where witnesses give testimony, and you can present evidence that contradicts one of their statements.

So here, Gumshoe says that the thief only goes after the most valuable art pieces in a heist. But we know that the item that was nabbed, a sacred urn, has no monetary value. So if we present this evidence in response to this statement, we absolutely dunk on the poor fella, because we just found a huge error in his testimony.

Being able to choose from any of roughly five statements, and being able to present from a huge list of clues and profiles, makes guessing near impossible. Especially because the game has a life bar that is diminished if you make a misplaced objection. So you'll really need to think hard about which piece of evidence to present during each cross-examination.

Okay, so this is much better, obviously. And it can lead to great detective bits, like this section from Life is Strange, where you need to pick the right clues from an evidence board to figure out where Nathan Prescott took someone after a party. The huge number of things you can pick from largely gets rid of guesswork, and it encourages you to look for actual connections, like dates and times, or the fact that this dude's car has a broken taillight, so this must be a photo of his number plate.

Plus, the game has some nice feedback for when you offer the wrong answer, with a small hint that will help you along.

[Speaker 9]
If I can match one of the text messages and transactions with Frank, then I can find the exact location.

[Speaker 4]
But this setup is still kinda giving the game away. Because, while the player is no longer being completely prompted by the answers, they're still being prompted by the text of the question, and it can give away that there's even a question to be asked in the first place. Not to mention the fact that the game can come across as some condescending jerk who has already worked everything out and is just making sure you're paying attention, making the player feel less like Sherlock and more like Watson.

How did I do? Well, John, really well. I mean, you missed almost everything of importance for the team, you know.

So perhaps we can go one step further and just give the player the tools to point out contradictions and connections without first prompting them with a question. That's how it works in the aptly titled Contradiction. In this campy FMV game, you interview suspects and gather a big list of statements.

You can then bump together any two statements that contradict each other to catch your interviewee in a lie. This is very different to Ace Attorney, because in Ace Attorney you always know that you need to find a flaw in the current testimony. The game won't move on until you do.

But in Contradiction, you can leave witnesses and come back later, which means you can have loads of different conversations on the go at once and never know exactly who is lying or which group of statements contain a lie. It means the player really needs to follow the case to know who is telling porkies. By the way, the most contradictory thing about this game is the ever-changing colour of Inspector Jenks' trousers.

They're grey, he walks a few yards, they're blue. What are you hiding, Jenks? Sorry, sorry, off topic.

Where was I? Ah, yes. This works great for connecting two pieces of evidence, as well.

I particularly like the system in Papers, Please, which isn't a detective game at all. It's about working at a border patrol. But this system would work great in a murder mystery game.

So in this game, you can't just reject people from entering the country without providing a good reason. So you'll first need to flag up a discrepancy between their dialogue or documents, and your rulebook. So you press the big red button and can then highlight two things that are in contradiction.

Perhaps the expiry date on a person's passport, and the current date. Only then will you be able to make your discrepancy. These systems are both great because the player is no longer responding to the game as such, but instead telling the game that they have spotted something interesting.

And in the case of Papers, Please, the ability to choose any two bits of text on screen is really awesome. There are simply too many combinations for the player to just brute force a solution. The player has to get really specific about the connection for the game to accept that they're on the right track.

And it means that any piece of evidence can be used, not just the ones that the game deems worthy of putting into your inventory. So this is a good solution for connecting evidence and exposing lies, but it doesn't really hold up for making deductions. Let me explain using this puzzle from Discworld Noir.

In this game, Luton automatically jots down useful information in a handy notebook, and you can combine two notes to make a deduction. And here, we connect a strange phrase that has been written on the wall of a crime scene with the fact that the deceased was hung upside down.

[Speaker 1]
If Mundi was hung upside down, and if Mundi wrote the message, then the message was upside down.

[Speaker 4]
And that's a pretty good puzzle, right? But for it to work, the game needs to give you notes for the strange phrase, Azeel, and also Mundi hung upside down. And that last note can really give the puzzle away.

Because turning thoughts into puzzle pieces means that you're not using your own logic, but simply using the logic provided by the game. But to get any better than this, we'd need a system that has no questions, and nothing for the player to give as an answer. Which is impossible, right?

Well, I'm glad you asked. So compare the Discworld thing to this puzzle in the lovely, teeny-tiny, rabbi-detective game, The Shiver. Okay, so you're reading the emails of this guy who died, Jack Lauder.

And you see these concerning messages from a dude called Ethan G. Maybe he's someone to track down, but we can't do anything without a surname. He might be the Goldwater that Jack's wife mentions in this email.

But Ethan G...

[Speaker 1]
And we're back.

[Speaker 8]
Oh hey, Otter's here.

[Speaker 7]
Hello. Hello.

[Speaker 5]
Welcome back.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, she snuck in. She's just watching.

[Speaker 5]
Otter's the person that came up with the ghost dedication thing.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I always welcome more mourners. So at the end of this lovely, lovely... ...hedge maze...

...or hedge area... ...there's a small cave door. Sorry, there's a small cave opening that goes down to a door.

And written in fey above it is Tor Bell. Translates roughly to Hollow of the False Widow.

[Speaker 5]
This is the place.

[Speaker 1]
I'd like everybody please to engage their exploration activities.

[Speaker 7]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
There are ants in my walls. I just found a trail of ants... ...in my kitchen, going into my wall.

[Speaker 8]
What the fuck? Ah!

[Speaker 1]
Fairy doors, my goodness. Ooh.

[Speaker 5]
Detect magic, avoid notice.

[Speaker 3]
I just saw the gif that Bessie put in chat for dead clink. The pigeon on its back. That's so funny.

Oh, I hope we get ghost clink.

[Speaker 5]
Ghost clink.

[Speaker 3]
That's such fun character development. Just rolling with the punches.

[Speaker 1]
Really, it's rolling with the claws, because that's the thing that killed clink.

[Speaker 2]
Rolling with the rending. Clink never seems to die, he just gets weirder and weirder.

[Speaker 5]
Why don't you try ghoulism on the way back? Alright. We're missing some exploration.

[Speaker 3]
A monk with an explorer. Oh, um, I was gone, probably, when whoever said whatever. What are we doing, exactly?

[Speaker 1]
We found the place. You do?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Seems to have been dumped into some kind of basement.

[Speaker 5]
So, Rani and Sairon need activities of monks being particularly lazy.

[Speaker 3]
Um, what's the scene?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, someone help Phragatha with detecting traps and stuff. I know you have a bunch of rogues and rogue-ish characters.

[Speaker 3]
I have thieves tools and a crowbar, if that helps.

[Speaker 1]
I think, I'm pretty sure it does.

[Speaker 2]
For a few things. Yeah, I can go out and get like, bonuses and stuff.

[Speaker 7]
Did we have time to grab a compass?

[Speaker 5]
We shouldn't need one in a basement.

[Speaker 1]
You had plenty of time to get a compass. Reasons unknown to anyone, you neglected to do so, again.

[Speaker 8]
Ugh.

[Speaker 2]
Clink has a compass, go into his pack and take the damn compass.

[Speaker 5]
Well, Nova took the damn compass.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 5]
Our attempt to better survive was denied. So, should we get Sairon on Seek, and then, what's Granny good at? Does Granny detect magic, or does Granny investigate?

[Speaker 1]
Seek is for, again, for like, hidden creatures and stuff like that. It's for traps, too.

[Speaker 5]
Traps and hazards.

[Speaker 1]
It is?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, exploration activity is, at least.

[Speaker 3]
Can I put my character on the screen somewhere, or is that illegal? Okay, perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Reserve the right to re-clown car you people. Yay!

[Speaker 8]
First challenge, a locked door.

[Speaker 1]
It just comes up as Seek. This is a fucking thing. God damn it.

[Speaker 3]
That's why I click. I'm not supposed to.

[Speaker 1]
That's what you were told to click.

[Speaker 5]
I'm streaming my, uh... You see this tab?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, hold on. Um, hold on. Uh, the, um...

Do I see what? This tab? The...

Yes, hold on. Let me grab that tab. That's my actions tab.

Uh, what do I do?

[Speaker 5]
Browse for Search, and then click Active on Search.

[Speaker 3]
Um, Search doesn't come up? There we go.

[Speaker 9]
Can I just add that? Add that.

[Speaker 3]
Why is it not being added?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, it worked.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it is?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
I now have two. I am doubly efficient. That is not English.

[Speaker 5]
Doubly is a word.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, it is English.

[Speaker 5]
Anyways, let's redouble our efforts.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, there you go.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty. Should we clown car again?

[Speaker 3]
I'm looking for, like, traps and stuff, right? That's why I did that? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Granny Agnes is in there. Detect Magic. Avoid Notice.

And I'll keep my nice little timer on there as well. Oh, so is Granny Agnes with us, Nessie?

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, yes. I am juggling tits. Oh, no worries.

I thought I pulled her into the... I did, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Before you is a locked door. Uh, you are... Siren, you are reasonably certain it is not trapped.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Any lockpicks? Is there tools?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, is this door locked?

[Speaker 5]
It is locked, but not trapped.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, do I... it doesn't say that I need proficiency with Thieves' Tools.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's Thievery Skill.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well, I'm... I have that.

[Speaker 7]
I think it's like a compass where you suffer a penalty if you don't have it.

[Speaker 5]
I think you straight up can't without a toolkit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, and then I just do Thievery. How'd I do? Ooh.

Not successful. You know what? Is it...

is it good?

[Speaker 1]
It's not a difficulty save for something like this.

[Speaker 2]
It's a light situation for the party. Um, Granny Agnes does have Detect Magic.

[Speaker 5]
You can switch to Investigate if you would rather do that one.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna do it anyway. I'm just gonna continue looking for traps. Not gonna die today.

[Speaker 5]
Did we get the door open?

[Speaker 3]
I don't wanna just open it, but I'm pretty sure we get the door open. That one's no longer locked.

[Speaker 2]
Is it locked?

[Speaker 1]
It's no longer locked.

[Speaker 2]
Cool, it's not locked, guys. Let's go! I accidentally shut the door on myself.

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... I doubt there's any traps in here. Hopefully there's not any.

Oh, no? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Ah! Oh, we just... we all got sucked up.

[Speaker 7]
Dun dun dun dun dun.

[Speaker 2]
I need to... I need to let go of the thing.

[Speaker 1]
There appears to be nothing in this room.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet. Well, I mean, there is something in this room. We're in this room.

[Speaker 5]
We matter. That's entirely, entirely true. Moving on.

What?

[Speaker 2]
Not actually entered the room.

[Speaker 1]
A bunch of cobwebs.

[Speaker 5]
Hi, trap. Hi, trap.

[Speaker 8]
Hi.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 5]
Can we avoid most of these, or do we... are we gonna need to disarm all of them?

[Speaker 3]
Looks like we can just avoid them. That one, we might need to, uh...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. That's on, uh, Siren again. Or is it Chiron?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, Siren.

[Speaker 5]
You know what they say, if there's webs, there's spiders. Say that. No one says that.

No one says that because that's not necessarily true. It's not necessarily true if there's no spiders here.

[Speaker 7]
Then where else do the webs come from?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
He has got a point.

[Speaker 5]
Spiders.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I think I can talk to spiders. I can talk to spiders.

[Speaker 5]
That's lovely. Please keep it to yourself.

[Speaker 2]
You can tell me what they say. I'd be curious to know.

[Speaker 3]
Do you hear gross clicking noises as he's talking to them?

[Speaker 5]
Feel like visibly jumps.

[Speaker 7]
Ah, spiders!

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Chiron, please deal with the weblerch deadfall that's over there.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Oh, uh, you know, okay. I will, uh...

[Speaker 5]
We'll need to walk through this room and hope there's no more traps.

[Speaker 3]
Right. What is a deadfall? Is it like you just fall through the ground?

[Speaker 5]
Yep. I think we still have to disarm it to cross it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, how can my thieves tools help with that? I pointed it out.

I pointed it out. Somebody burned the web.

[Speaker 5]
Disable the device.

[Speaker 3]
Is that...

[Speaker 5]
Is that all you... It's a tripwire that lets a bunch of boulders loose.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Uh, well then I can just... We can...

Can we just not step over the tripwire? I pointed it out.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. That works. Listen, as long as that's the only trigger, you're good to go.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure nothing will go wrong by just doing it then.

[Speaker 2]
Um, so we're gonna move as a party through this room?

[Speaker 3]
You know, maybe Siren should go first, just to make sure. You know, if it's his fault, it's his fault, and he's the only one that gets hurt because of it. So we'll...

We'll send Siren first. If he gets fucked up, then, you know. Hmm.

Um...

[Speaker 2]
If any, Agnes is towards the back, but Monk is, like, right behind Siren. And he's only behind Siren because Siren went first. Otherwise, Monk.

[Speaker 5]
At least Hooch's dead center. Yay! Protected!

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so... We go?

[Speaker 7]
Going, going, going.

[Speaker 5]
And we just hop over this one. Without touching it.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Do we need to roll for that?

[Speaker 5]
If we're dedicated to the plan of just stepping over the tripwire, let's just do that.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh. Went down there?

[Speaker 1]
This one is also locked, by the way. I'm sure it's really supposed to be a secret door.

[Speaker 5]
Founder moment.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, everything seems to be off a little bit.

[Speaker 1]
There's no clear... There's no clear handle on this one. I'm curious.

With your exploration activity, you would be able to see...

[Speaker 3]
Ah, yes. I'm very glad that I can see.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sorry. Alright, so... Basically, you guys can see light from underneath it.

Speaking of which, what is the light situation with you people?

[Speaker 8]
You people? Rude. Um...

[Speaker 3]
How do I see? Where can I see that?

[Speaker 5]
Anybody got the cell light?

[Speaker 7]
I feel it hasn't had a good day. It should be on the left-hand side. Underneath perception, for initiative, it should have your vision.

So I've got dark vision.

[Speaker 1]
Do you guys have...

[Speaker 7]
Most races will have no visual eye vision.

[Speaker 2]
I said exactly that thing, but I was muted.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah, two of you have dark vision.

[Speaker 1]
The rest of you are in... This is pitch black.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Do you know light? I didn't prepare it today.

I have low light vision.

[Speaker 2]
Why didn't you realize I would need it?

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Anybody got a torch then? Peach has a torch.

Can I borrow it?

[Speaker 3]
I got alcohol. I have something. Hold on.

Let me check my feats. I have fey cantrips, which have light. Oh, neat.

So I can cast...

[Speaker 5]
Up to four of us can have it cast on us.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Peach has a super light.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. I think I put that in there. There we go.

Yep. I'll cast light. Good job.

I'm going to attach the light to a creature, causing it to float near that creature. Who wants it? Not me.

I'll get it! Oh, okay. We can both actually have it.

Nah, it's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Nah, it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
You can have up to four of them.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Alright, alright, alright. I'll take one too.

[Speaker 5]
To the north?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. The locked door was to the south. Oh, but you can't go north as well.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
The locked door we don't know anything about.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Doors.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, plus one's bigger here than in other games.

[Speaker 1]
Where do I see somebody's... Where do I see somebody's... Like...

Where do I see somebody's senses? And like, how far they can see in low light and such like that.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, the party... I think the third vision has something to do with...

[Speaker 1]
Somebody's individual...

[Speaker 7]
In the party, on the overview, it'll have the party's senses. So like, dark vision, yada yada.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so I... Did you just say that?

[Speaker 7]
Dark vision, I believe, isn't time-limited. Uh, distance-limited.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't distance-limited. Okay, that makes sense.

[Speaker 8]
Ooh. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Accidentally deleted a bunch of my walls earlier. It's the right map, I just deleted a bunch of walls, I'm not sure how I did that. Makes it way worse.

[Speaker 7]
Much better.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so I have paused the party for the moment. You guys are at a bunch of different doors, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 5]
Lower left, lower right. Upper left, upper right.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, this worked so well in this other campaign I did, which means it didn't. But we all grab a door and just open it. At the same time.

I think that's a terrible idea. It goes fast, we get shit done.

[Speaker 8]
We get eaten by five monsters at once. Each.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I vote this door. It does sound fun, but it sounds, uh...

[Speaker 2]
It's super fun, but...

[Speaker 3]
Fun until it isn't.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Monk will test the door.

[Speaker 2]
Oh sweet, it's open.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Look, eagles.

[Speaker 1]
A bunch of nitflits in here. Sitting around casting dice. They look marginally surprised to see you.

[Speaker 3]
Hey. What's going on? They're probably playing D&D.

[Speaker 5]
Fucking nerds.

[Speaker 3]
Sweet. Couldn't be me.

[Speaker 7]
And we've just ruined...

[Speaker 3]
Ah, now what will you be?

[Speaker 1]
We're playing.

[Speaker 2]
Monk will close the door. Is there something to offer? What do you have to offer?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, my patience.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Bye! I don't know if anyone else is going to say anything.

[Speaker 5]
Did that just work?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. They didn't attack us. Uh, you want me to open up this one?

This one. Cross the way.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds good to me.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wait, wait, wait. No, this is going to be funny. This is going to be funny.

Hey! What? Do you guys know what our...

Just real quick. Do you guys know what's in these other doors? Like the one across the way and the one down the halls?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you know what?

[Speaker 2]
Why don't you just ask him what we're trying to find?

[Speaker 1]
There's movies the size of your head. And you can eat them.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet. Sweet. That's in this door across the way?

Just across the way. Cool. What about the ones up there?

You know what?

[Speaker 1]
My memory's not what it used to be.

[Speaker 8]
Goodbye!

[Speaker 5]
I think he was opening up for a bribe.

[Speaker 2]
The only thing I have is alcohol. I'm not giving him my booze. Okay, what's in this room?

[Speaker 5]
A full-on explosion.

[Speaker 2]
If we survive this door, this room, and you want to ask them and bribe them, you can go for it.

[Speaker 5]
No, Viola just doesn't realize when people aren't taking hints. Or when people...

[Speaker 2]
Miss hints?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. No. It's weird.

It's very specific, but it's a very...

[Speaker 2]
Oh shit, guys! There's a person in this room!

[Speaker 3]
Are they taller than me? Like...

[Speaker 2]
We'll see.

[Speaker 3]
Are they hot?

[Speaker 2]
Valid question. I'll let you know. Hang on.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative, please.

[Speaker 3]
I'm only two feet tall.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. You're small.

[Speaker 7]
I don't think you can appreciate being asked if you're hot.

[Speaker 2]
I don't exactly know what it is yet, so I can't give an answer. It's just the generic... Dude, there's a second bigger thing!

What is that?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, it's a swarm of spiders.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yo, you know, if you... Alright.

[Speaker 8]
I'm just gonna go ahead.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not one to judge. Do spiders know your thing? Go for it.

It's not my thing, though.

[Speaker 5]
I think we've well established that they are not Viola's thing.

[Speaker 2]
No. Wait, wait, who is the one that speaks to spiders? Siren.

Siren, you're my man! Get over here! When you...

Yeah, actually, I can't tell you to get over here because you're first. Get over here! Oh god, I'm carrying you.

[Speaker 3]
You're strong. You can stand behind me if you want. I can use diplomacy to make an impression, and request...

Here, I can actually just put this in chat, I think. Maybe. Click on the icon.

Was I able to put it in chat? No. What the fuck?

Oh, because it's paused, that's my bad. Oh. Okay, let me open that up again.

I'm, like, spamming it. Okay. Did that work?

That did not work. No, it wasn't my fault, actually. Okay, well, I can speak.

I can use diplomacy to speak with spiders. I'm going to use that. And I'm going to politely...

Oh, good lord. I'm going to politely...

[Speaker 2]
You got this, man. You got this.

[Speaker 3]
He's really awkward. Nah, do you want to drop a boo? Guys, uh, can you, um...

Can you guys not attack us, please? Oh, god!

[Speaker 5]
Plus zero, plus zero.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, then he's going to attack. Hold on, where's the shadow? That's the small one in the middle.

I don't even see it.

[Speaker 5]
I think my familiar might be stuck in the wall.

[Speaker 1]
That's because you're, you know...

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Uh... Um, I'm colliding with walls.

I can't move. I want to move on top of monk. Boop!

There we go. Um...

[Speaker 8]
Uh...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, god, wait, there's another extra thing there? Oh, god. Um...

You know what? You only live once, you only die... Uh, a couple times.

Once. Um...

[Speaker 2]
Well, I... Not to, like, be that guy, but I think you learned that you kind of only die once. Like, an hour ago?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to take back... I'm going to take back what I've just done. I'm not going to move there.

I'm going to move back here. Because I used diplomacy. Um, and I would like to, uh...

Yeah. I'm just going to move back here. Um...

And, uh... And end my turn. Because I want to have at least three things.

Because my... I want to, like, you know, attack them and then move away, but I can't do that, so... We're just going to return to our place.

He's tiny, so you guys can walk around him. I can't move there. Can you move me?

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you! Um... Oh!

I am not getting eaten.

[Speaker 8]
I...

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's a horde of spiders. How big are the spiders, actually? Those are tiny.

Okay. Not big at all. There's just a lot of them.

There's just a little nibble.

[Speaker 8]
I'm two feet tall, Manny. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Stumbling Stance... Woo-hoo-woo... Flurry of Blows...

[Speaker 8]
Oh...

[Speaker 2]
Bomber! Um... I'm going to...

Oh, it still misses? Shit. Alright.

Cool. I am... It's really hard to hit a spider.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's not a spider. That's a shadow.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, what is this? Oh, that's the shadow? Oh, shit!

I would have been hitting the spider!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah! The shadow's in the middle. He's the little guy.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, my bad. Um... Would that have hit...

Would those have hit the... ...spiders? 15 and a 19, would that have hit spiders?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Cool. You rolled twice for Flurry of Blows, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. The 19 and the 15 are...

[Speaker 1]
Blow time.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Oh, he's got one... No.

Nope, he's dead. He's done. That's his turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. You did kill him. Hey.

[Speaker 8]
Oh! Ha ha!

[Speaker 5]
Veal's gonna step...

[Speaker 8]
You can tumble...

[Speaker 5]
You should be able to tumble...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And you should be able to tumble through me.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, Veal is not going to do that. He does not want to be in that room. But the offer is appreciated.

Evil eye on the shadow.

[Speaker 3]
You could close the door. I doubt spiders can, like, open the door.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but I... Like, Monk can.

[Speaker 8]
Ha!

[Speaker 5]
Evil eye targeting Veal. I succeeded. What?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. I succeeded.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. Uh... In that case, I am going to additionally cast...

[Speaker 8]
Hm. Hm.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to cast Phase Bolt. Uh, and attack it. Damn.

That's his turn. Hold on. Oh, Monk is...

[Speaker 8]
Ah, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Spider.

[Speaker 5]
Monk. Oh, no. Oh, no.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to get you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Death by a thousand nibbles.

[Speaker 1]
It really is.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's not like an attack. I just need to go... What, here?

Go ahead and make me...

[Speaker 3]
This. Okay. Yay.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, bummer. And also you, Veal.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I'm going to switch to Public Roles now.

[Speaker 8]
You, you.

[Speaker 1]
And I also need you to make a Fortitude Save Monk.

[Speaker 2]
Just Monk? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. No, you're fine.

There we go. I have to make another one like this? Wait, wait.

[Speaker 1]
I rolled for you and you got a ten.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay, so I take the... Oh, okay.

So I just need to take the damages and the... Do I take the two damage?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this one's just Enfeebled and... Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Man, I'm already Enfeebled.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it doesn't let me drop poison onto you. Maybe you're immune to...

[Speaker 2]
I don't have any... They're going into my Free Actions. Spider Swarm Venom.

So that's cool. Now I can bite the spiders back and poison them.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Hooch.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, Hooch's time to shine. I can't see the enemies. No!

I see like a Swarmish character here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, um, this guy is just a huge swarm of spiders. Can I attack it from where I am?

[Speaker 7]
Can I attack it from where I am?

[Speaker 1]
What are you asking? Are you going to throw a dart at it? Or...

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to throw a bomb.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you can certainly throw a bomb at it.

[Speaker 5]
Did somebody specifically close the door?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 5]
It looks like it's shut.

[Speaker 2]
It was shut. It was an accident.

[Speaker 7]
Or would I need to move up here?

[Speaker 2]
Like... Why are you asking me if?

[Speaker 7]
Well, because I can see the squares like in here. So I'm not sure if I can attack it from there.

[Speaker 4]
What was that?

[Speaker 1]
Throw an attack against it.

[Speaker 4]
I don't want to...

[Speaker 2]
Attack, attack. I killed a swarm of spiders with my bare hands. So you should be able to...

[Speaker 7]
I didn't mean to do it, I meant to not be a spider. Why is that not working? There it is.

It's... Ooh, splash damage. Yep.

And a bomber specializes means it doesn't have to target anyone. I can focus the splash damage on one target. Rather than everyone.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I love that feat.

[Speaker 5]
Bomber.

[Speaker 1]
It is dead.

[Speaker 7]
Beautiful. Is... There anything else that I can see?

Can you see anything else?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know why you're trying to like... Jip me out of a movement action. Just make a movement action.

[Speaker 7]
Well, because I can't stop there. So I move to up here. I don't see anything in there.

[Speaker 2]
You can tumble through monks to go into the room. You can make them tumble through allies. This guy is a shadow creature.

So you have to go like...

[Speaker 7]
Oh no. Whoops. There you go.

Yep, there. And then I'm a... A shadow creature.

[Speaker 2]
It's what James said. Actually, he said shadow something, I added creature. I don't remember the full name.

But it's a shadow.

[Speaker 7]
Oh. There's one thing I know that shadows don't like lights. I'm going to use quick acme to...

Make another aquamist fire. And throw it at the shadow guy. And it's a flat penalty.

Hits by just barely. Yay. And so that'll be...

Two attacks and a move. Yep, three actions. That's my turn.

[Speaker 8]
Four.

[Speaker 7]
Does fire seem to work on it? How much damage does it do? Ten.

Ooh.

[Speaker 2]
Eleven fire damage total?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, ten fire damage, one splash fire damage. And I believe two persistent fire damage. But I'm not sure if that's the start of his turn or end of his turn.

[Speaker 2]
It's usually the end.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I see. Okay, so that's why.

[Speaker 7]
I get a racial advantage, double. Didn't take any damage?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I don't like that.

[Speaker 1]
You should not like that.

[Speaker 5]
Can't believe shadow demon money gang's already been brought out. Heh. I'm glad I got at least a chuckle out of that, because I sold everything I had to make that joke.

The last bit of respect I had for myself. That's not good.

[Speaker 8]
Goodbye, Hooch.

[Speaker 2]
That's a 31 to hit? Damn.

[Speaker 1]
This is not a good creature to be fighting.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, I got an idea.

[Speaker 3]
We shut the door.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly!

[Speaker 7]
Void damage? Void doesn't sound good at all.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, void damage.

[Speaker 7]
Is that just like, the negative? Like, I'm dead?

[Speaker 5]
Does it matter at all that it is currently in bright light? Is it? Do you guys have the light spell?

Yeah, Viola has light on her.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, Monk has a light spell on him. That's magical. We have creatures in bright light, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Alright, so how do I redo this?

[Speaker 7]
Undo and heal up. Woo!

[Speaker 2]
Siron and Monk have light. Right?

[Speaker 7]
Is the shadow creature considered in bright light if he's on fire?

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
I think it's specifically light.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. And then I have his other two attacks. Hello, Monk.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sup? You said, shoo. Ouch!

That's not what's up.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, did I take that 13 damage? Why would you not take 13 damage?

[Speaker 1]
I thought those said something because of the light. No, no, something had to do with the light because it's...

[Speaker 5]
Okay, that's two crits in a row.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but we have the same one. Ouchies.

[Speaker 5]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
You didn't take the 13 damage twice, did you?

[Speaker 8]
Nah.

[Speaker 2]
No, I didn't.

[Speaker 8]
In all fairness, that was like a 24.

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait, no, I want to steal a shadow.

[Speaker 2]
Can I do that? Please steal someone's shadow instead of attacking me. That'd be great.

I would love for Monk not to go down.

[Speaker 3]
He was like two characters tonight, oh god.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh, I wouldn't want to play ever again. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Oh man, this is...

[Speaker 2]
Oh cool, he stole your shadow. Oh wait, does that attack on Monk still?

[Speaker 1]
No, because it's going to stride. I don't like being in magical light right now.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yes, please go interrupt the nerd.

[Speaker 5]
You just let it go in, the nerd's beat it to death with hammers.

[Speaker 2]
He's like, hey, there's no gems in here.

[Speaker 1]
There's nothing you can see. That's a shirt.

[Speaker 2]
Did it move?

[Speaker 5]
It did. It ran away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, my thing's just lagging then.

[Speaker 1]
That'd be difficult to see beneath. He's south right now.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, no, it lagged. Oh goodness. Let's see.

Okay, okay, I can do this at this point.

[Speaker 5]
Still within 20 feet of at least one of the lights.

[Speaker 2]
Granny Agnes doesn't have a light on her.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but the...

[Speaker 2]
But...

[Speaker 1]
Why is there crosstalk between the... I don't recall anybody doing like a recall knowledge check or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thank you, no, no, no. That's what I wanted Agnes to do. I wanted her to recall knowledge on this guy.

[Speaker 1]
By all means.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for reminding me. Do I recall anything? We love persistent fire damage.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. You're aware that... Alright, so what do you get for...

For recall knowledge, exactly?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I have to... I have to say what I... I...

[Speaker 7]
I think there's like a couple questions you can ask about it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. What other things besides magical... What's one other thing besides magical light that hurts it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no other special weaknesses.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Light vulnerability, so magic items... Or, magic set... Oh, wait, wait.

So... Force, ghost touch, vitality, or spirit... Will bypass its damage resistance.

[Speaker 8]
Okay...

[Speaker 7]
Um... Is spirit like holy?

[Speaker 8]
I have no idea. Hmm...

[Speaker 9]
Spirit is a specific kind of damage. It's not necessarily holy.

[Speaker 2]
And I don't exactly have any of those. So... That's a bummer.

I guess I'll just do this and see what happens.

[Speaker 8]
Hey!

[Speaker 2]
Whatever that's gonna do, you just... Multiply that.

[Speaker 1]
How do I damage this thing in a way? I'm just gonna do it manually. Nope!

[Speaker 9]
What are you trying to do?

[Speaker 1]
Incorrect. I was trying to manually... I was trying to have it...

Suffer damage. I was trying to bypass... It has resistances.

Conditional resistances. Huh. If it's in magical light.

[Speaker 9]
It should have done it.

[Speaker 1]
It's not registering that it's in...

[Speaker 9]
Oh, it's the light thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Come on. Back to bed, guys. Come on.

And... please. I know, buddy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's why it's... Okay, so it's... All damage, five.

Double resistance versus non-magical.

[Speaker 8]
That thing has a...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he's Granny Agnes. He's at the end of your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, uh... I was just waiting for the damage to pick it up.

[Speaker 8]
I have... I can't believe...

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We're gonna be closing the door, right?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, we can, but the guy's already out of the room. We're fighting the shadow right here. It's...

Running away. If you've got light... Maybe you could, um, attach...

Can you attach lights to it?

[Speaker 3]
I could try. See? You can attach lights to that guy.

Okay. Bet.

[Speaker 8]
I use light cantrip.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Light cantrip, and... Hope that works.

If it doesn't work, then it just... I guess it goes to the ground? Like, the light just kind of hits the ground?

And stays there? I'm gonna put it on myself, too, because I can put it on multiple different people.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah!

[Speaker 3]
Um... And then I will... Hit it with my dagger.

Oh, I gotta target it. Boop. I like that it scolds me.

Um...

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Try your... Also your light cantrip as well.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Uh... Okay.

I'll take a second. Because I don't have that cantrip in my thing, I'm using it via... Fae cantrip's feet?

[Speaker 1]
So it's a willing creature, so...

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I just put it on myself.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Put it on the dagger, and... I don't know. Stab it.

[Speaker 3]
And it's a critical! I can also just put it on my- Can I- Wait, can I actually put it on my dagger?

[Speaker 2]
That's what James just said. Put it on a dagger. Sorry.

It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if that's a thing, or if you have it on your second attention, or something. But I'm just thinking about it.

[Speaker 3]
I moved... I... Lit myself...

With a spell. And I stabbed. That's three.

Good luck. Alright. Wish me luck.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that did actually do some damage. Whatever his... Special thing is.

It's just a monk!

[Speaker 3]
I'm tiny, so you can't be in the same block as me. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. So I'm near you... With...

No! Come hang out with us, buddy!

[Speaker 3]
Hey, he could come join us! We don't have to kill him.

[Speaker 1]
Monk's... Oh! If you want to make that damage...

[Speaker 8]
Oh, wait.

[Speaker 2]
You want to try to get him in our favor?

[Speaker 3]
Wouldn't it be... You know, have a little shadow friend following us around? I mean, I wouldn't, you know, turn your back to it, or sleep nearby it, but...

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'm gonna kill it. I mean, unless you feel really strongly that you can... No, get him!

[Speaker 1]
Okay, move three of those... Well, he can't, but I will absolutely...

[Speaker 3]
Do it just for the fun of it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. What do you mean, he can't?

[Speaker 3]
Because I have a zero in all of my... I'm untrained in everything...

[Speaker 5]
Evil Eye, make me a save, guy.

[Speaker 3]
You're a rogue! How are you untrained in everything? No, I'm untrained in everything charisma-based.

So, um... He's just... You know, he's also really tiny.

I need a wisdom save.

[Speaker 2]
Peanut Party... Who chose the best intro?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I didn't mean to... That's my bad. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I got 27.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, yeah, that beats it. Unfortunately, FaZeBolt time.

[Speaker 8]
Hey! Hey!

[Speaker 3]
Serum just kind of points and is like... You! Join us!

[Speaker 1]
It holds up its hands, and... You see chains appear around its arms, with its fetters wrapped around its body. And it kind of encases itself in like a cocoon.

[Speaker 8]
On cocoon mode?

[Speaker 9]
Did it work? That was...

[Speaker 5]
That was Viola hitting it with the FaZeBolt, right? Or... Or rather it using some kind of defense against it?

Oh, it's...

[Speaker 1]
I was describing the results of the Antipodeid.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay, okay.

[Speaker 8]
That's my bad.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so it's all cocoons, right? Okay, so... So...

I'm gonna drain a bottle of alcohol real fast. Real fast.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm okay. You guys won.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Since... Does anybody here level 1?

[Speaker 2]
Me! I level 1! Granny and Monk!

[Speaker 5]
Viola is 948 of a thousand for level 1. Alright, so that's four of us.

[Speaker 1]
I am 90% sure that Viola leveled up earlier. What the fuck?

[Speaker 5]
No, she's 50 off. 52 off. There's a whole thing because...

Burr? We don't need to hear your YouTube shorts.

[Speaker 8]
Let's see.

[Speaker 5]
Found a reference in chat.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you guys are... What?

[Speaker 3]
So... Is this shadow friendly towards us or is he just gone? He's a ball.

He's a ball.

[Speaker 2]
So... Monk is currently draining a bottle of alcohol to see if he can get the shadow in the bottle. For easy transportation!

[Speaker 8]
Oh, Monk's level 2! There we go.

[Speaker 7]
If that doesn't work, would I have some in my alchemy tools? Would I have something he could fit into there as well too?

[Speaker 5]
That's cute.

[Speaker 7]
If that didn't work? No, no, no! Don't waste good stuff!

Here, look, look, look!

[Speaker 2]
I'm not wasting it! I'm drinking it!

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, man.

[Speaker 3]
Rooch is only level 1?

[Speaker 7]
Rooch is 2.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, great.

[Speaker 1]
Monk is now level 2. Yola's now level 2.

[Speaker 2]
Monk is level 2!

[Speaker 7]
I am 992 experience.

[Speaker 8]
Nice.

[Speaker 7]
Can I have a bonus HP if I can just level?

[Speaker 3]
Punch me. You'll get the XP from punching me.

[Speaker 7]
Please, sir, may I have some more?

[Speaker 3]
You're going to remind me of the brother, may I have some oats?

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
Well, Conker?

[Speaker 1]
I am... Yeah, so, I'm ready to stop. Because I'm good and tired.

[Speaker 8]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
I fucked up the maps I made earlier, which is really annoying. I was like, no...

[Speaker 7]
If we stop here, could I have an extra 8 experience if I level? No. Absolutely not.

Aww.

[Speaker 1]
You should have killed those gremlins when you had the chance.

[Speaker 3]
We should go back and kill them naturally. Hold on, if he can punch Siren for 8 health, at least 8 health, can he get 8 XP? No.

If he manages to deal 8 damage?

[Speaker 2]
Bart got stuck with 1 XP before leveling up. I don't think you're going to get 8.

[Speaker 8]
And then Siren for influence.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, thank you. Poor Geddy. So kind.

[Speaker 1]
And it will successfully be stoppered in the bottle.

[Speaker 8]
Yay!

[Speaker 2]
Alcohol solves everybody's problems. What?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. I keep interrupting too much. I'm sorry.

It's, uh... The... Granny Agnes, the only skill that made a success for the Shadow was Academia.

I believe it would be reasonable, therefore, for you to know that this protective coating is a call. C-A-N-U-L It's a call. It's something that usually forms around incorporeal undead if they've been...

It's kind of like a neutral state for them. Like if they've been recently killed or if they've been modified in some way. If they've been reset to the beginning of their incorporeal undeath, that's kind of what happens.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
It's a protective coating of ectoplasm, and you can separate it from them. And usually incorporeal undead are expected and willing to engage in some service for a time. Assuming you don't sell them off or melt them down into something else.

[Speaker 3]
Or accidentally drink them.

[Speaker 2]
He was going to say he's never made that mistake, but he honestly was like, well, I can't vouch for everything he's done.

[Speaker 1]
Can you say that for sure? Yeah! And when you answer that, can you answer without lying by accident?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah! So Munk's not going to say it because he can't actually trust that he has never accidentally drank it.

[Speaker 1]
No, this is going to be the Karen Reid trial all over again. The second Karen Reid trial. So three years ago you testified, ba-da-ba-da-ba!

I have your current statement from two minutes ago right here, fuck-ass! They don't match!

[Speaker 2]
So yeah, Granny Agnes will tell that to Siren. Like, isn't that cool? I'd say that you should have the bottle, but I don't think you could handle it.

No!

[Speaker 7]
Hooch is great at handling bottles. You can give it to me if you'd like.

[Speaker 1]
Siren could probably fuck around with the, uh... It said the Wraith surrendered to him. Or something.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yeah. Can...

Can I have it steal things for me?

[Speaker 1]
How good is Siren at stealing things? That's a good question.

[Speaker 3]
Can I have it, like, you know, or, like, tap people on the back so that I can, like, pick their pockets and stuff? This would be, like, fun.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Can't you be able to get it to do all of that? It is...

in a sort of servitude towards you.

[Speaker 3]
Be my buddy. Don't tell my sister.

[Speaker 2]
Would Granny know if...

[Speaker 3]
Somebody's at the wing, I'll kill you!

[Speaker 2]
Oh god. Oh no! Would she know if it'll fit...

[Speaker 8]
It's you, Frogger! That's you, you're at the wing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. When did this happen?

[Speaker 1]
Excuse me? Just now.

[Speaker 3]
Just now.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Would she know if it can fit in any size bottle?

[Speaker 1]
It's already in the bottle.

[Speaker 2]
Well, yes. But... Can...

Can... Can Ceres carry one alcohol?

[Speaker 1]
An even size.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah! Oh, you can carry an alcohol! Oh yeah, okay, okay, okay.

Um... Alright, well, let me give you... Let me give you one alcohol, and you can edit it and name it as your ghosty friend.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
That was beautiful work you did.

[Speaker 3]
You gave me two. I will drink the other one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, shit. Yeah, I guess I meant to give it to you.

[Speaker 3]
What should my shadow's name be?

[Speaker 5]
Shade.

[Speaker 7]
Yep, James.

[Speaker 1]
Shadow had 250 silver pieces.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 2]
Ceres, look at you now.

[Speaker 3]
250 gold, wait, silver pieces, Richard. Thank you, everyone.

[Speaker 1]
We have a base camp outside the dungeon. Some of your characters can go home if that's what they desire. There is an important town council meeting in Bronlock on the 30th.

Characters can choose to... If people want, they can, you know, handle that in downtime, or I will probably just be in chat after work, because I don't have my night shift that night, I just have, like, the evening shift. So I'll probably be in chat just to hang out, and if people want to influence the meeting of that council, one of the topics is whether or not there's actually a bunch of fiends, like turning it into a fucking Stargate episode, hollowing people out from the inside and spreading rapidly.

And present one player character will be there and testifying, or will be summoned to testify. We'll see if Cammon actually shows up. And besides that, thank you guys for playing.

That was entertaining. Oh, she's killing somebody off the bat.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you for running the game. You suck for that.

[Speaker 9]
Did you actually just put them against a level 6 creature?

[Speaker 1]
It was a random encounter. They didn't have to kill it. In fact, they did not kill it.

[Speaker 5]
It had to kill us. That was the dynamic of that encounter.

[Speaker 1]
No, I did that for the love of the game.

[Speaker 7]
The love of the game. It doubled my AC.

[Speaker 5]
It doubled Kling's health.

[Speaker 7]
It nearly doubled mine. It was, like, 6 damage of suffering my life. Yeah, it was close.

It was really close.

[Speaker 5]
You're the lucky one out of that one, Hooch. You get all the survivor's guilt.

[Speaker 1]
I was asking you guys about the exploration rolls beforehand. For, like, spotting things and stuff like that.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled!

[Speaker 1]
No, a few people did roll, like, eventually. But it's like, alright, we're like half an hour in.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled before combat. I rolled before combat.

[Speaker 1]
That was good. That was good.

[Speaker 2]
Not that it mattered.

[Speaker 1]
No, now you have, like, motivation. Alright, next time that call goes out, you gotta make sure the others are following suit. Because it could be, even if you did things right, the failures of others could result in your character death.

But it's okay. Kling can come back as a ghost, probably.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. He won't know the difference. It's gonna be great.

[Speaker 3]
He's just slightly blue now. Seethrough. He's fine.

He's always been this color.

[Speaker 2]
What are you talking about? And that's when you realize that Kling doesn't even know anything. That Kling is colorblind.

[Speaker 9]
Kling only comes back as a ghost because he doesn't... He's not smart enough to understand that he died. All he knows is things.

[Speaker 5]
He met the ferryman and he took the pocket of change.

[Speaker 9]
Oh my gosh!

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, two coins!

[Speaker 2]
Nobody gotta help me, I'm being hunted!

[Speaker 8]
No reason, just help me!

[Speaker 9]
Oh, James, that gives you an excuse to use some of the monitors.

[Speaker 5]
Psychopomps, my beloved.

[Speaker 1]
I love Psychopomps. I only know about Pathfinder 1-E Psychopomps, but...

[Speaker 5]
They... I think they moved to be the true neutral monitors and have that as their role in 2-E at the beginning, before Remastered and Alignment was still around, so the Aeons could be lawful neutral. I am realizing I did not ever think about the fact that Viola was eventually gonna need a...

My baby, Nosoy.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe I should just...

[Speaker 7]
Wait, so, I'll start... I had 257, did we split that yet?

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty sure Sarah's... Sarah's a hodge. Okay, first off, Ragatha, fuck you for having two siblings with the same sounding names.

Secondly, Aaron took all the money because it was technically his bounty.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, no, it was a joke. We're splitting it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well then, just first off, fuck you for naming them so similar.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I mean... She took his name, kind of. The reason their names are similar is because she kind of took his name, sort of, when he died.

Her original name is not Charis. She took his name to keep him alive a little bit longer. Okay, that's sweet.

Stupid, but sweet. Now he's back, so they're just...

[Speaker 2]
That's just awkward. Yeah. Oh, cool bird.

[Speaker 1]
Did you just look up the Nosoy?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you did look up the Nosoy! I just clicked on that.

[Speaker 5]
I love this. I think there's another Nosoy.

[Speaker 9]
There's also the Moringa? Morgana? Morigna.

[Speaker 5]
My personal favorite, my absolute baby, is... Oh god, what's the skeleton one called? Vanth?

Vanth, heart emoji.

[Speaker 9]
I saw one that I really like, that just looks like a little guy. Just an absolute lad. Keemdatchoppers.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I found Klink as a ghost, y'all.

[Speaker 8]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 9]
Well, it's too late, I already made the token. Wait, what?

[Speaker 8]
Oh, that's cute.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, his new token is pretty cool. Oh, please post it, I want to see it.

[Speaker 6]
What is this? I'm so surprised.

[Speaker 5]
Is that Velstrak in the play again? No, it's not Velstrak. Warcraft Psychopomps?

[Speaker 1]
What is a Moniker?

[Speaker 5]
It's not cute.

[Speaker 9]
They have something to do with the Boneyard, the Axis, or the Maelstrom.

[Speaker 2]
The Foofer.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, it includes the Aeons.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry, if you bite it, then it's gonna slip.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Voidwyrm. Emma play Wrath of the Righteous.

[Speaker 9]
God, I love the designs of the Aeons, though. Except that guy, he's just a centaur.

[Speaker 2]
Emma loves that it's becoming canon that Klink stole from the Fairyland.

[Speaker 9]
I mean, it's just so Klink.

[Speaker 2]
It is Klink.

[Speaker 9]
Very Klink.

[Speaker 2]
No. Yep. At least I did, huh?

[Speaker 1]
I just really know. Alright, folks, I'm gonna hop off and stuff my face with Oreos or something.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. So, were we sharing some of that silver?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, how much was it?

[Speaker 7]
250.

[Speaker 3]
250, um... They have five orbs, so it'd be 50 silver each. Okay, 50 silver each.

[Speaker 1]
There are six. I don't know why you said five. Wait, no, that's a familiar!

Ah, you tricked me. How did you do this?

[Speaker 7]
I thought you were gonna say there's six people in Discord.

[Speaker 8]
Leaving my base.

[Speaker 1]
Goodnight.

[Speaker 7]
I'm dead now.

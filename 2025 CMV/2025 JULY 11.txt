[Speaker 6]
This is a test.

[James]
I should put the beanie on at this point.

[Manaia]
Hello, James.

[James]
Hey, how's it going?

[Manaia]
It's going fine. How are you doing?

[James]
I'm doing all right. A little sleepy. I freaked out.

I had like a schizo moment last night after I got home. As my, uh, my, my toilet kept spontaneously, like, I don't know, not flushing, but doing that thing where it's like refreshing water or whatever.

[Speaker 6]
And I heard a noise.

[James]
I heard that. I'm like, all right, let me get up and just double check because my cat looks a little weird. Um, let me just go like check to make sure everything's like good inside the home.

I get up and there's, there's a glare on my glasses, all my glasses, which were like dirty that caught just right. So I, so as I'm like approaching my bedroom door that goes out into the hallway, it looks like somebody up here, like just a little bit, like a limb maybe appears and then like very quickly moves away. It like the motion blur of somebody, not even seeing a person, the motion blur of somebody who was like right there moving very quickly.

I was like, what the fuck? I like ran after it at first, didn't see anything, went back and got a machete and I saw that my fucking, I hadn't locked the door. I was like, ah, what am I doing?

[Manaia]
That seems like vaguely harrowing. Yeesh. At least it was just the sun's glare rather than a person.

[James]
Oh, cause yeah, cause it was the light like bouncing off the inside of my glasses, which are again, dirty and I messed them up all the time.

[Manaia]
Hmm. Well, at least it wasn't a person. Yeah.

[James]
I think I would have been happier if it was a person.

[Manaia]
Really?

[James]
Well, I had the machete.

[Manaia]
Yeah. Fair enough.

[James]
Yes. They're like, which is better, an actual home intruder or hallucinating a home intruder? Definitely hallucinating.

Not for me. I don't want to hallucinate a home intruder. I can't deal with hallucination.

But I live in Texas. I can deal with the home intruder. It's going to be a very stress relieving for me.

Ugh.

[Speaker 7]
To each their own.

[James]
Give me that intruder. All right. So Levin, this is your first session, which means it is mandatory that we do a dungeon crawl.

Your first session.

[Speaker 6]
Woo.

[James]
Woohoo. Now you've been given, oh, somebody gave you access to the foundry. That's excellent.

[Mantra]
Yeah. I asked Verheese.

[James]
Awesome. Because I didn't know, because I think it doesn't like ping people right now.

[Mantra]
Oh, the ticket system? That's why no one checks it. Okay.

I get it. What's that? That's why no one checks the ticket system.

[James]
Well, there's, there is a ticket system, but it just doesn't, I set it so it's no longer pinging all of my friends every time it goes, every time somebody requests something and they get like a, you know, a mention ping. Does it ping you? It does ping me.

I think it was like, I don't know what time of night it was.

[Mantra]
I got it though. I see. I'm going to add DK Ark though.

[James]
Okay.

[Mantra]
Does this gizmo make you stay up too long?

[James]
Well, no, here's, well, it's funny you mentioned that because I was having like other kind of like moments at work, which is, which is normal. I, you know, sometimes at night, if I'm like really strung out, they're like, ah, random noise. I'm getting freaked out because I'll be like alone at the warehouse on night shift.

I work a night shift. So that's what I should have opened up with. I work at night shift.

That's why I was so late.

[Mantra]
Is that a moment? I think that's a bad combination. My night shift was producing me.

[James]
Oh, there we go. Does the dark make it worse hallucinations? You cut in and out for a moment.

[Mantra]
Does the dark make your hallucinations worse?

[James]
No, no, it's not even, it's not the dark. It's noises. Only noises?

I know I have an issue with the, the issue is like if I'm at the warehouse, which is connected to a bunch of other warehouses. So if somebody else is working early in the am they do something, the sound will travel along the wall there. And, and we'll make noises and there's also animals that will occasionally come inside the warehouse.

There's cats, skunks, raccoons, opossums.

[Mantra]
Oh, do they break out at the warehouse? Do you store like food?

[James]
No, no, it's, it's okay. Oh no, we store vehicles is what I'll say without getting too far into my job. They're not looking, they're just looking for shelter.

Probably for the most part. Either way, they're making, there's something making noises there and I'm like, oh, fuck, I don't have a gun.

[Mantra]
No, no, who's around here? The cat? What's up?

To shoot the cats?

[James]
No, not to shoot the cats, because the cats are not concerning. But before I see that it's the cat, there is a, there is a moment of ambiguity where it could be something else.

[Mantra]
Like a person. I see. I thought in Texas you're allowed to conceal carry though, right?

So can you just bring your gun to work?

[James]
Oh, that's really, so that's tricky. There's a bunch of legal interactions there. I don't have a concealed, I don't have a.

You don't have a license? I don't have a firearm that is okay for, you don't need a license for concealed carry anymore, actually.

[Mantra]
But they limit it to certain firearms? I feel like any firearm would be lethal enough.

[James]
The thing is, I don't have, I don't have a firearm that I can carry concealed. Or open for that matter. No, no, it's not illegal.

Like I do not have a gun. I don't have a pistol.

[Mantra]
I see. What is it?

[James]
7, 11, 25.

[Mantra]
What are you counting?

[James]
Okay, so we do this thing called one-to-one time. It's very simple. It's a rule from Advanced Dungeons and Dragons that was forgotten because all the people who started on AD&D did not know how to read.

But it makes one day, for each day that passes in real life, between sessions specifically, one day will pass in-game. I see. So the last time that, or sorry, not the last time that we played, what was it?

Yeah, the last time that we played was the 4th. So, and it's been, and that was on a Friday. A week has passed since then.

It's now the 11th today. It's also the 11th in-game. I see.

What this means is for a lot of people, they do a lot of downtime actions like earn income is really useful because you have more than just one day to do it. Ditto for long-term crafting projects and, you know, Kingmaker stuff and stuff like that.

[Mantra]
I see. Hello.

[Speaker 7]
We have. Hello. Hello.

[Kuji]
Is it too late to join?

[James]
No, not at all. No, I'm waiting on, we're just waiting on Rez. In fact, with you here, we'll probably be able to actually start.

[Mantra]
I think two more people should be present.

[James]
So Nessie was going to show up at the appropriate time, but I was, but I overslept. I see. People started a new event, right?

Well, there's two events. I didn't even create a new event. I just created the old one.

Oh, so you just rescheduled it. Yeah, that way it would ping people like who had originally marked themselves as interested. It would like, say, hey, it's starting just in case something changed for them.

[Mantra]
Let me draw my token on the macro, just to make sure I did it right. Okay. How do we delete a token?

[James]
You can't, I can delete.

[Mantra]
Oh, God.



[James]
All right. Yeah, it's like the one thing that I don't let people do is very important in a Westmarch, as it turns out.

[Mantra]
All right. I just put my token in the corner of the map. No one will notice it.

No worries. So this is the town of Braunloch.

[James]
This is in the Valley of Semede, which is about roughly the size of Chile. No, Chile? Am I thinking Chile or Argentina?

Argentina. Sorry. The valley is roughly the size of Argentina.

Braunloch sits in a right along the side of Loch Bonner House, which is a very large lake. It's not really a lake. It's like an inland sea.

It's about the size of the Mediterranean.

[Mantra]
Peninsula?

[James]
No. It's a lake. No?

It's sort of Mediterranean.

[Mantra]
Okay.

[James]
It's a really big lake. Yeah, inland sea, basically. Okay.

Now, peninsula is a section of land that sticks out. Peninsula is a Florida, a unit of Florida that's sticking out into a large body of water. Now, there's a central river that runs throughout most of the valley, and this is kind of the midpoint of the valley where Braunloch is built.

So, it's a major powerhouse as far as trade, economics, force projection, and stuff like that. There haven't been a ton of wars in the valley ever since the Dwarven forces from the east pulled back about 500 years ago. It's been, you know, just enjoying this eternal summer for the past millennia.

And, unfortunately, that's now looking like it's going to come to a close. All the summer fae are fleeing. This is actually the second time that many, or I might even say most, no, not most at this point because we have a bunch of new people.

But this is actually the second time some of the player characters have witnessed this happen. The fae who control this valley, or are major powers in this valley, participate in something called ballads, where they tell a story, usually about their own life, some greater heroic deed. And reenacting this story is magical in a way that it pulls the elements of the story back together.

So, people will take on the role that people will reprise their own story, sometimes coming back from the dead. Sometimes somebody else fills in for a role, like maybe it's a story about some famous duel, and the person, the human who died long ago will come back to life. Or sometimes people will fill in for that human.

And completing the ballad offers power, especially if you win the ballad, if you do your part, that offers power to the season of a given fae house, or given fae court. Of course, there haven't been any ballads in a really long time, because it's just been summer. There's been no turning of the seasons.

But it seems like for reasons that only the players of the last campaign know, the seasons are beginning to turn again, all of a sudden. It's freaking the summer fae out, and last game, they finished up the campaign, but with basically a reset. The ballad of the players was enacted by the king of the local winter court, of the Hyborial Court, and that was our justification for, one, getting to do it over again, but two, also switching to Pathfinder 2nd edition, because the first one was in 5th edition.

[Mantra]
I do have a question. So who does the winter ballads? They just get some other guys to do that?

What do you mean?

[Manaia]
Hello! Howdy.

[James]
So players can do winter ballads. A few of them did so, last game, actually.

[Mantra]
Okay, so they get the same people. They don't get monsters to do the winter ballads, they just get normal people.

[James]
Some of them are monsters. Oh, I see. So similar.

Some of them are themselves, because they go in to reprise their own roles. Campaign chat, somewhere around here. Somewhere around here I have a design channel that has, there it is, Chillness Valley Design, and there is a Dwarf Fortress.

See, I knew it was here. I knew it was here. Why did I think it wasn't here?

I need to upload the Dwarf Fortress music for this particular Hidden Bluff. Speaking of which, Hart, can you explain the Hidden Bluff? I'm going to tag Rez again, I swear to God.

[Manaia]
Alright, so the Hidden Bluff, general summary of it, it's a dungeon that goes down several levels. Currently, at this point in time, the dwarves are trying to explore within the Hidden Bluff. There's some areas that obviously people haven't discovered and whatnot, and it's constantly updating regardless of if we go in or not.

So, TLDR, dungeon. People want stuff in the dungeon. There are different factions, like mermaids, nixies, and dwarves.

The main problem are the nixies. They hate everyone and everything minus themselves. There are some plans to make friends with them, but that's later.

So, since there's so much valuable things in the Bluff, many people are trying to go into it. And we're going to explore the upper levels. It becomes more dangerous the lower you go down.

[Mantra]
I think someone's already using the first level. I think another token's already there.

[Manaia]
Oh, that might have just been the last group. They'll probably be vanquished.

[Speaker 7]
Quick summary.

[Speaker 6]
I'm just going to keep going. Umm. We can do it.

It's good. I hope. It's good.

We're just going to try to work through it together now. We're going to be at home. We're not going to be in California doing the things we're doing.

We're going to be doing the work that we want to do, and that's it. I just want to say one more time, I just want to say, do our part. Yep.

Thank you. Thank you. Do you think that we should continue to be doing this stuff?

Yes. I agree. We should continue to do that.

I agree.

[Speaker 7]
What's up? Did you say something? No.

Okay. That was a good summary, by the way.

[Kuji]
I even wrote down a note about it myself.

[James]
What did you write a note down?

[Kuji]
No, I was joking. It was like, yep, I wrote that down for myself.

[James]
Ah, I get it. What the hell is it? Oh, tutorial.

Yeah. Okay. I have no idea how any of these are measured.

Anyways, who do we have for our... I'm going to activate. Is it 331?

Ah, cool.

[Mantra]
Anyway, so who do we have venturing with us today? I'm here, Heart's here, and then Rekiki's here.

[James]
That clarifies nothing for me. Who do we have for characters?

[Mantra]
Oh.

[Kuji]
What's everyone else?

[Mantra]
Like, what character, what class? Oh. This is my character, a halfling human monk, level 1.

[Kuji]
Monk? Damn it. Heart, what are you bringing?

[Manaia]
Sorry, I didn't count who everyone else is bringing.

[James]
Oh, we were just about to ask who you were bringing.

[Manaia]
Oh!

[James]
You're all like in a Mexican standoff right now for like, I'm not gonna...

[Manaia]
Yeah. I was very much hoping everyone else would select... Because she's a treasure hoarder, so.

You know, it'll work well. Minaya is a crow, an awakened animal. Small bird, a thief.

[James]
I see. She's not a kenku anymore, she's like literal...

[Manaia]
Yeah, yeah, no. Part of the reverse of the curse that she wanted to do was to go from a kenku to a bird. Now she's a bird but not fully a crow yet, so she's like, I'm this much closer, but I'm still not properly a crow, I still think like a human, and I cannot find my owner.

This sucks. So slightly closer to the goal.

[James]
That was her backstory. It's so good.

[Kuji]
And I bring Kujin Kajuu. A lovable lizardfolk droid. Who likes to explore.

[Manaia]
Yippee!

[Mantra]
And who are you bringing, Lemon? Oh, yes. This is my level 1 halfling human monk.

Her name is Mantra. She is a bit farther up in the north in the valley, and has come down to hopefully try to drive the winter back. So she's trying some of these ballads out.

[James]
Very good. And then Rez is still not here, is he? No.

So be it. In that case, we're going to start, as usual, with a small combat encounter.

[Manaia]
Are you a level 1? No. Yes.

No. She is a level 3 character. I can change it to my level 1 character, which is there for level 1 adventures.

[James]
You know you don't have to do that. Oh, I think I removed your familiar. No!

[Manaia]
Her familiar fucking dies. Oh dear. It's fine.

Let me drag them all the way back up. Okay. You'd be surprised how difficult it is to drag things upwards.

There we go! They're back. I have a question.

[Mantra]
How do I make the character fall?

[James]
You're going to have to turn up your gain. You cut it in and out just ever so slightly. It's one of those things where people sound like they're right below the gain filter, so they cut in and out a little bit.

Is this better? I won't know until you don't cut out again, but possibly. What was your question?

[Mantra]
Okay, I just turned my sensitivity a lot down. How do I make a character folder?

[James]
Oh, I do that.

[Mantra]
Oh, okay.

[James]
If you last your first session, I will happily do that. I'll probably do it anyways. But let's have everybody drop in on that green square.

I don't know if you can actually see that, but if you drop yourselves into the middle of the map and then drop yourselves, then you'll see the green square. Into the sea? That will be the dock.

[Manaia]
Hello, Rez!

[Rusk]
Hello, it's me.

[Manaia]
Oh, Rez is here.

[Rusk]
Yeah, I'm just trying to get a character portrait. It's always the hardest thing.

[James]
Oh, I have another character portrait for you. It's going to be a slightly different colored version of the last one that I gave you.

[Rusk]
Oh, yeah, I saw that. It's going to be great. It's going to look fabulous.

[Mantra]
Okay, I got a character portrait for you.

[Rusk]
I hope you're quicker than James.

[James]
You better hope you're... Extreme, Jesus. Well, maybe that's how it should be.

Alright, folks, go ahead and add yourselves to the combat encounter.

[Rusk]
I dropped myself in the circle? I assumed so.

[James]
Is there a circle on the map? Oh, there is. Now go ahead and draw yourselves over to where the boat thing is.

[Rusk]
Alright. God, how do I roll this again?

[Mantra]
Right-click your character token and click add to initiative. I think that worked. Okay.

Did you check voice overflow?

[James]
I never check voice overflow. Oh, hey, that's pretty cool.

[Rusk]
That's actually pretty fucking good.

[James]
Anybody in there? Rez? Yes?

Oh, you are added to initiative, so who are we missing? We have Mantra. I don't know who that is.

Mediah. Vera, who are you playing? Sorry.

[Kuji]
Did I roll it? Why is that not working?

[James]
You gotta add yourself to initiative.

[Kuji]
I'm rolling perceptions for initiative, not initiative perception. No shit. Silly me.

Hmm. My bad.

[James]
No worries, no worries. You folks are going to see a bunch of ripples appearing in the water. That's south of your position.

It's a series of reef claws. I got it.

[Rusk]
I'm going to let it look kind of stupid. They look like things to kill.

[Kuji]
They look like lobsters, ale with lobster claws.

[Speaker 6]
You're right.

[James]
So, first person up is Rusk, who has forgotten how to play.

[Rusk]
Yes, exactly. This is going to be great.

[James]
If you do want to, delay your turn.

[Rusk]
Yes.

[James]
All right. I'm going to delay you until after Verheehy.

[Mantra]
I'm going to delay you until after Mantra. It just says player character. What the hell?

Coogee. Yeah, I think they just forgot to name their token. The enemies are in initiative.

That's supposed to be right.

[James]
The enemies are absolutely in initiative. All right. What the fuck?

I must get Verheehy.

[Rusk]
Is that like a fucking skaven?

[James]
There's a muted skaven.

[Kuji]
Oops. This is not my turn. Move instead to combat turn.

Turn is not your turn.

[James]
You know what? Because I think so. Are you sure?

[Kuji]
Yeah. I'm kind of dry. But now it's Lowie.

[James]
Okay. I reset you as a current combatant.

[Kuji]
Perfect. I'm going to use two moving turns to get him to dry safe land. I'll give my minion one move to get the direction to move with me.

Now it's my turn.

[Mantra]
Mantra. Mantra is going to do the exact same thing. Stride twice.

And I guess stop at their time. And then end their turn. I forgot to end their turn.

[James]
Now where's Rusk?

[Rusk]
Let's see if I can figure this out.

[Mantra]
What do you do for him?

[Rusk]
So I have three actions, right? Yes. Okay.

Three actions. I'm going to spend one action to move. I think that's stride 15 feet.

[Mantra]
Yes.

[Rusk]
Actually, no. I have 20 feet. Okay.

And then... Everyone's on land, so... But stride again.

Now stride again. Alright. That's my turn.

[James]
That's totally fine. There's nothing wrong with tidying.

[Rusk]
I'm just trying to figure out how to play again. It's fun.

[James]
Oh, I see. It doesn't think it's in water. It doesn't know it's in water.

Swim 30. Two actions to get up to the boat, and a final action to climb inside. The other will do the same.

Minaya, you have friends.

[Manaia]
I would rather not have friends, so Minaya is going to make haste, if you will. So just, uh... How many feet is this?

Hold on, let me do the math real quick. So, 20... Alright, I can do 40 to get to shore.

Yep. That will be... That will be two actions.

Then I'll spend my last action to do a fun spell. There we go. Uh, let's see.

Rusk is going to be on the front lines, so you can get this cool status. I cannot give it to you. Okay, please take the spell effect Stoke the Heart.

Drag it onto yourself, alongside the effect Familiar Spirit.

[Mantra]
Okay, so you see on the right, there is effect, spell effect Stoke the Heart? Click and drag that.

[Rusk]
Spell effects... I do not see that.

[Manaia]
In chat. Do you see in chat?

[Rusk]
Oh, although, okay. Now I drag this...

[Kuji]
So drag both Stoke the Heart and...

[James]
Where's your token?

[Manaia]
Hey, there you go.

[James]
Now there's a lot of really good automation on this.

[Manaia]
So have you dragged both of them onto you?

[Rusk]
Oh, there's an effect Familiar Restored Spirit as well?

[Manaia]
Yeah, that one as well.

[Rusk]
Okay. Ah, thank you for buffing me.

[Manaia]
You're welcome, and that's the end of my turn. Interesting.

[James]
I have a final rift claw. It's going to... You see it dip below the water.

And nothing else appears to happen. Fair hee hee.

[Kuji]
I'd like to delay my turn until something gets closer.

[James]
Oh no, you can delay your turn until, like, uh... After a thing, or you can...

[Mantra]
Hello! Mantra! Mantra is going to stride and ready an action to strike when someone comes into your reach.

Rust!

[Rusk]
Alright, Rust is going to stride. The rift claws are over there, okay. Rust is going to stride here.

And I'm going to cast the Heal of Spirits spell. I don't have enough focus points, what?

[Mantra]
Just click on your thingy and you should get a focus point.

[Rusk]
Okay, yeah, I see it. And that's going to cause me to raise my shield. And then I can ready an action to strike if someone comes close to me.

[Mantra]
Okay, so you see Spell Effects, Shields, and Spirit on the right side? Just like the Spell Effects token part? You can drag that on.

And there should be an action to raise your shield, too.

[Rusk]
Okay, and then... Oh my god, the amount of fucking buffs! This is cool.

So, Raise Shield. Where's that? Actions?

I think it might already be raised, because...

[James]
Yeah, I think you have it up. No worries. And then, do you say you're holding a...

[Rusk]
Yeah, I might want to do that. Ready an attack action for if an enemy comes within my...

[Mantra]
That's two actions. So you can't move, raise your shield, and ready an action. Hold on.

[James]
What's the... Sorry, so what did you do this turn?

[Rusk]
I used the Shield of Spirits spell, and I strided. I moved.

[James]
Alright, so I think that the spell is two actions. No, it's one action. So if you use that, and then you raise your shield, and then you stride, then that would be your turn.

[Rusk]
Oh, I thought... I was getting the impression that the spell caused me to raise my shield, because it says you raise your shield.

[Mantra]
No, you're right. Is it capital Raise Your Shield? Yeah, it should actually just Raise Your Shield.

Because it's capitalized. That's the action.

[James]
Yeah, no, you're good then. So you can hold an attack for something coming near.

[Rusk]
Okay, I'll do that. Perfect.

[James]
I have a Reef Claw. Oh, come on, please. Please, let me...

Let me move the screen. I'm begging you. Give me a sec.

I need my mouse.

[Speaker 6]
It goes over there.

[James]
Swim. It's gonna go under and disappear from view. There.

[Kuji]
Unmute, please. I don't like that. Where did it go?

Um, can I delay my turn more?

[Speaker 6]
Sure.

[Kuji]
I'll delay it after Mania's turn.

[Mantra]
Ooh, there we go.

[James]
Well, I can't spend an action to grab full target, but I can damage you. Unless you go ahead and make me a little fortitude save.

[Rusk]
Oh, that failed. Now you get to take 1d4 spirit damage.

[James]
Oh, I do? You should ping that.

[Rusk]
Uh, the spirit damage?

[James]
1d4 plus 2, actually.

[Rusk]
That's actually a pretty strong spell.

[James]
It's turn. No, it's good. It's very good.

[Rusk]
I actually feel like a tank. Wow. Imagine.

[James]
Mania, is Hark going to be muted?

[Manaia]
Uh, we probably should move away, lest we get hit. What is the circle surrounding again?

[James]
I think it's within the spirit shield thing.

[Manaia]
Ah, okay. Okay, so how terrible do we want to demolish this thing? It is not so bad.

I will simply take an action to move out of its range. Or at least, till it's inconvenient. Actually, you know what?

I'm joining everyone back here. Hello. I'll take the action to move back there.

Hold on. 5, 10, 15, 20. Yep.

I'm in the wrong spot for it to be 25. Give me a second. I need to be here.

Okay, so take an action to move away from that thing. And then with two actions... We shall, um...

We can do needle darts. Ah, I missed. Fear not.

That was... That was off. Um...

Damage. Good enough. Good, very good.

Oh, is that the end of my turn?

[Rusk]
Oh, right.

[Manaia]
And that is the end of my turn. Sorry.

[Rusk]
No worries. It's a ribbit.

[James]
Oh, that's a ribbit.

[Kuji]
Alright, bear hee hee. Alright, now that there's something we can see... Yay.

I'm going to do a little shocky shocky.

[James]
Oh, I have to make it safe first.

[Speaker 6]
There we go. Bear?

[Kuji]
Yep, yep. I'm into a save.

[Mantra]
Yep.

[Kuji]
Click the spell to do the save. Is it on your screen? Or...

I did it. 19, yep. So you do half.

[James]
Maybe it just took a while to get to you? Go ahead and refresh.

[Kuji]
Yeah.

[James]
I see it.

[Kuji]
Yeah, I see it. You've done a little thingy on it. Yeah, so you should take half of the full damage.

[James]
So two electrical damage. It says two damage.

[Kuji]
Yep.

[James]
And that's me done. No other action? You have an action, bud.

[Kuji]
Ah, I... Give it to my family to attack if something comes within our next adjacent.

[James]
Okay.

[Kuji]
Are you ready? Sorry. I might have been a little bit beat for that one.

[James]
The tree frog is going to begin digging through the dirt. Weakening the tunnels underneath the beach. Plunge you two folks into...

Oh, not two. Sorry. Oh, that's just fair.

[Kuji]
I know. I didn't like the sound of that. Into somebody's deep water.

[James]
That's going to attack you. Oh, it can spend an action to grapple. You know what?

[Mantra]
I'll do that. Because it popped up within their range. Yep.

Go ahead. I'm just going to do a little pop.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, very good.

[James]
Hey!

[Rusk]
Gone. Reduced to atoms.

[Kuji]
Yum.

[James]
What's the... What's the reach on the Karasagama?

[Mantra]
It's ten feet. Oh, it is ten feet?

[James]
Okay, good, good, good. Okay, so I don't... The first strike that I hit you with earlier does not hit.

But I am going to make another strike. With death frenzy.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Kuji]
That's... Very good.

[James]
That brings us to the top of the round with Mantra. Where the hell is the other reef ball? He's under...

[Mantra]
Oh, the other reef ball is under. Yeah, it's still under. There you go.

That is going to ride here. They are going to inhale and do an inner upheaval. You do not have.

I forgot to recharge. Okay, there we go. And then let me drag the spell effect to my token real quick.

And then they are going to do a flurry of blows on this guy. And they miss. Okay.

And then they are going to stride back here.

[Rusk]
The buffs have worn off. Oh no.

[Kuji]
That would be four moves, wouldn't it?

[Rusk]
What was that?

[Kuji]
One move up, one inhale, then one flurry of blows?

[Mantra]
The inner inhale makes the flurry of blows as part of the action. Okay. Okay, it's my turn.

[Rusk]
I'm going to stride towards this creature. I'm going to use ever stand stance. To apply the effect.

And then I'm going to smack it. That's a 26 hit.

[James]
You know that it hits. I know that you know that it hits. And he knows that you know that it hits.

Ah, yes.

[Rusk]
It misses.

[James]
Alright, that's it sir. There's one left.

[Mantra]
Okay, how do I remove an active status effect? I'm not used to this module. So I can't just click and drag it off.

If you right click it on the top right of your screen. It should remove it. Oh, it's in the top right, I see.

[James]
And then I need it to make. A DC 17 for food save, please. Jaws is good to go.

I failed a grab, so. I'll try to hit you again. Nope.

Mania. May or may not.

[Manaia]
Ah, there's another friend. Delightful. Okay, well.

We are going to try and vanquish this foe. Oh dear. All my spells are just helpful ones.

Well. By helpful I mean support, I should have clarified. Needle darts again!

And it misses. It's a lovey. And we will recast Stoke the Heart.

Who's closer to the reef? Mantra, you take it. There you go.

And I'm just going to give myself the. Oops, I gave it to the wrong person.

[Rusk]
No worries. There we go.

[Kuji]
Yep, time to. Nummy num num nums. And they do a little bitey bitey.

Missing. Oh, that's not good. Going for a second attack.

And give Coogee two attacks. Wow.

[Manaia]
This is giving me flashbacks to the last time we were on the water. Mantra.

[Kuji]
Just kind of ravages this beast and it's just fending itself for its claws.

[Mantra]
So they're going to. Oh, this one's the healthy one, I see. So they're going to stride.

They are going to flurry of blows. Miss and A. Miss.

And they're going to strike a third time. Critical miss.

[Manaia]
You have a hero point you can use to reroll that first one. If you want to use it for that.

[James]
Fair enough.

[Rusk]
All right. Stride, stride. And strike.

Take this, foul beast.

[James]
Hey, there we go.

[Rusk]
The power of shield compels you.

[James]
It is hurting.

[Rusk]
I bet that didn't feel good.

[James]
It is appropriate for it to. Attack you in that.

[Rusk]
Oh, it hits. I'm going to. Respond to that damage.

[James]
First, you are going to make a fort save.

[Rusk]
Okay. 24.

[James]
Oh, I see it. That's funny.

[Rusk]
I have the. Where is it? There we go.

My champion's reaction. How do I show this? Where even is it?

Oh, there it is. How do I drag this? There we go.

[Mantra]
Sorry, I had to take a call. No worries.

[Rusk]
I gain resistance against the triggering damage. 2 plus half my level. I'm level one.

[Mantra]
Pathfinder always rounds out. If you drag it over and apply it to yourself.

[James]
I'm going to reverse the damage. There you go.

[Rusk]
That's cool. I like how that is automated.

[James]
Now, there you go.

[Rusk]
Yes. This is pretty sick.

[James]
Do it again. Click on the roll icon. Selfish shield is still up.

[Rusk]
That's not good. It is supposed to only apply for one attack.

[James]
No worries. I can do it again. Poison.

[Rusk]
That hurts.

[James]
I'm going to have it flee under the water.

[Rusk]
Get back here.

[James]
Absolutely not. You guys did proceed and leave.

[Rusk]
There is an experience tally? What is this? I actually went pretty good.

[Kuji]
That was a weird and unsafe experience for us.

[Mantra]
Did anyone get hurt? Yes, I got beat up. Which is my job.

You got owied.

[Manaia]
Slightly, but I'll be fine.

[Mantra]
I'm just going to pull out a bandaid. Oh. Heal companion.

You're going to accept the bandaid? Yes, I accept. I accept all bandaids.

They will make a medicine check to treat you.

[Kuji]
I'll refocus while they do that.

[Mantra]
While the bandaid does not do much, it seems like you got reminded of all the times you've been injured. This one does not seem that bad. You will heal 2d8 HP.

Let me check the train.

[Kuji]
There is a basic action macro you can drop down. It gives you all these cool things you can do.

[Mantra]
I'll get that companion.

[James]
If you go to the left, there is browse macro directory. If you go to the left of your hotbar, there is a tiny folder icon.

[Mantra]
You're going to heal 5 HP. They will refocus too.

[Kuji]
I guess we should really move away from this water.

[Mantra]
Yes. We are going to the hidden bluff, right? Yes.

Where is the hidden bluff? There is a trapdoor.

[Manaia]
Do not investigate random trapdoors. They are bad for you.

[Mantra]
Are you sure?

[Manaia]
Typically.

[Kuji]
We just need to follow the trail of candy. That will lead us right there.

[Manaia]
If you follow the path, you will also go to the hidden bluff.

[Rusk]
How do I remove these effects right now?

[Manaia]
Oh.

[James]
I'm sorry.

[Kuji]
It's still good. Just give it a little brush.

[Manaia]
Unless the cat got to it first. Sorry, dude.

[Kuji]
Just cook it. It will be fine.

[Manaia]
The devious creature. During this break, what are you guys up to?

[Speaker 6]
I think we all went for breakfast.

[Rusk]
Right now, we are making my god's footsteps.

[Manaia]
Ominous.

[Rusk]
Trying to find a worthy opponent.

[Manaia]
Actually, if I click on your little guide, I can see some... No, the stats aren't visible. Sad.

If you go into the bibliography part and you hit the little eye icon, you can choose how much or how little you want to reveal about it. Some characters would be fine with sharing more. You can have more visible of that.

[Rusk]
Can you show me where this is?

[Manaia]
Let me broadcast my screen, if that's okay? Would that help? Or should I just screenshot it?

[Rusk]
Share your screen, it's fine.

[Manaia]
Okie dokie. Share your screen. Foundry.

Hello! So you click on your little character sheet. You see your character sheet, right?

If you go to this thing, the thing that says biographic, I said bibliography, that was wrong. And then there's stuff like appearance, the height, the weight, the backstory, if they have their own personal edicts and anathemas, what they like, dislikes, random campaign notes and stuff. If you want you to be visible to other people, you hit that little eye on the thing.

So when people click on your character, they'll be able to see it. If you don't want it, then you keep it shut. It's automatically shut, though.

But as you can see, this character would be very forthcoming with information, hence why everything from backstory to what they like and dislike is visible.

[Rusk]
And the DM can obviously see hidden stuff, right? Can the DM see the hidden information?

[Manaia]
Only the DM, because they kinda need to. The DM can see hidden stuff, but other players can't. For example, let me click on someone else's.

For example, click on Mantra. See? I can't see everything that's being shown, but I can see how tall other characters are.

And if I click on you, I can't see anything, because it's all hidden.

[Rusk]
Well, I haven't filled this out yet.

[Manaia]
I'm not actually seeing anything, it's just empty. Yeah, no no no, it's fine. I was just trying to show an example that even if it is filled out but hidden, it will look like, you know, that.

Example. Alright, that is your little crash course for today. Explore the other little icons in your own time.

They're all fun.

[Rusk]
I must say, that was actually really fun combat. Especially for level 1. It felt like there was so much for me to do.

[Mantra]
That's just Pathfinder 2 women in general.

[Rusk]
Compared to 5th edition, it felt like I had a lot more freedom and agency. The problem with 5th edition is you usually have to get to a really high level to have a lot of options. The problem is a lot of times in D&D you don't have that many options.

Yeah, and I have like 3 times as many at level 1. So I feel like I have agency.

[James]
Go ahead and drop those items. I noticed. You guys can keep talking by the way, I'm still waiting on my coffee to heat up.

My original meal plan was disrupted.

[Manaia]
I'm sorry dude, that sucks. That was one of the first things I noticed when starting Pathfinder. I'm just like, oh my god, I don't feel useless at the first level.

That's awesome.

[James]
You guys are also playing like an 8th level starting level.

[Manaia]
No, it was just in comparison to other games. When we were starting at 8th level I was so happy during our 5e stuff.

[James]
That's why the Kickstarter got funded so quickly though it didn't get a ton of backers. It got funded really quickly because Advertise's level 8 started.

[Manaia]
Everybody love.

[James]
I thought I shook you.

[Manaia]
Alright, BRB, I have to check on what's on the oven.

[James]
No worries. I don't know what I'll do, so I'll just order coffees.

[Mantra]
We're taking 5, we're gonna go get some water, okay?

[Rusk]
Yeah, sure dad. Did I drop myself in the right place? Where am I supposed to drop myself?

[Mantra]
I have no clue.

[James]
Yeah, fuck it, I'll just place the order and restart what's broken, why not?

[Kuji]
You deserve a coffee.

[James]
I do. My beep was stolen. What are you doing?

[Manaia]
You stay there. Is it trying to apologize or something? No, he's in timeout.

No, he's in timeout.

[James]
Gay baby jail.

[Manaia]
Deserved.

[James]
In the meantime, we now have Dwarf Fortress music back, I am so happy. And then I think I have another one that's just the entire OST, it is. I have all of my music from the old one.

[Kuji]
I have my little sachet coffee and a glass because we've got no clean ones.

[Manaia]
Do you feel fancy?

[Kuji]
Yeah.

[James]
I would love to exclusively drink coffee out of the wine glass, that would be awesome.

[Mantra]
You can do that, nothing's stopping you.

[Kuji]
Nothing is really stopping you doing that.

[Mantra]
I don't have any wine glasses, that's stopping me.

[Manaia]
I've missed another good one. You can take one from a bar, they won't notice.

[James]
I haven't been to any bars down here. I should. My favorite coffee barista who was moving to Houston recommended like three bars well, technically two bars and one speakeasy.

[Manaia]
Not going to bars is cheaper than going. If you ever go there, take a glass. They will not notice.

[James]
Not going to bars is really stressful and that has like second order expensive effects. Me not having my ADHD medication for like two weeks now because of a single idiot fucking doctor that's causing me to eat a lot more because I have more of an appetite. They have received my network.

[Speaker 6]
Hello.

[Manaia]
Oh right, Rez, I should have mentioned during the revealing slash not revealing information a lot of people don't have their information revealed regardless of if they're hiding something or not, so you don't have to worry about it too hard if you see someone with no information they're probably not out to get you.

[Rusk]
They're all out to get you.

[Manaia]
Don't listen to the devil on your shoulder, listen to me.

[Rusk]
The devil on your- Okay, so the devil on my shoulder is very convincing and Oh dear. I'm going to survey the party with skeptical eyes.

[Speaker 6]
You're an idiot.

[Rusk]
The devil on my shoulder is- Speak up!

[Kuji]
Kill some people.

[Rusk]
You're an idiot. Okay, we're not going to do that. These people are still useful to me.

[Manaia]
Okay, so I think there's what, two devils on the shoulder now? I don't know how they're multiplying at this point.

[Rusk]
They're multiplying, there's just more of them.

[Mantra]
It's fun for a reason. They just perform mitosis. I like how my character is pre-obviously- And the same happens with the angels too, every time you listen to an angel they duplicate.

[Manaia]
Unfortunately he's listening to demons only, so there's two of you now. What the demons told me to.

[Kuji]
One of them is reasonably speaking. One's like, kill everyone, and the other's like, kill some people. And you're like, don't kill anyone.

[Rusk]
I like how one of my edicts is to literally just wear armor in combat.

[Mantra]
That's a great edict. Eating house insulation is good for you.

[Rusk]
My edicts and anathema are surprisingly easy to follow.

[Manaia]
Oh, that's good. Don't forget to drag your rusk into the party sheet. Just so...

management reasons.

[Mantra]
There we go. And you go into your actions. There should be three tabs.

Encounter, exploration, and downtime. And you can check your exploration activity. Okay.

[Manaia]
Also, if you wish, you guys can drag your token. Do you see where I am pinging? If you're on Ashe of Creativity.

There's a little cone thing all the way at the bottom. If you just drag your tokens there, that's where we will be.

[Rusk]
Oh. My attempted movement collides with at least one wall. I didn't know where to put my character.

How do I remove my token from the sheet?

[Mantra]
You cannot.

[Manaia]
What are you trying to do?

[Rusk]
I placed my token because I didn't know where to put it. I placed it in the middle.

[Manaia]
Hit delete on your keyboard.

[Rusk]
Delete.

[Mantra]
Tell me that he disabled those permissions.

[Kuji]
I can delete.

[Rusk]
They're useful permissions to have. I'm here.

[Mantra]
I can do it.

[Manaia]
It's for your own token. Not for other people's. Can you do it to yourself?

Click your token. No? Genuinely, I don't know what is up with that.

Hmm.

[Rusk]
Question.

[Manaia]
Yes. Answer.

[Rusk]
How do I refill focus points?

[Manaia]
Left click on them.

[Mantra]
Left click on the circles.

[Rusk]
Do I get them back after a rest?

[Mantra]
You can take 10 minutes to refocus. Your version of the magical ritual.

[Rusk]
There we go. I think I have enough time to do that.

[Kuji]
Yes, you do. You have time to refocus. Perfect.

[Manaia]
What is your music?

[Mantra]
Are you screaming?

[Rusk]
You see me like... For me, my form of meditation. Is an intense exercise.

That involves screaming. And doing a lot of push-ups.

[Mantra]
That's why applying a single band-aid took so long. Because you're working on those games.

[Rusk]
You see like... This guy. Doing...

Screaming, going up and down. Up and down. This is like a barbaric war cry.

If anyone was within a couple miles. They would hear it. He gets up.

Wipes the sweat off his brow. That was refreshing.

[Mantra]
You work out so hard, you get more rejuvenated.

[Kuji]
It helps you focus.

[Manaia]
The rest of us have to cover our ears. Because you were screaming for 10 minutes.

[Mantra]
That's what the earplugs are for.

[Rusk]
This is going to attract something bad.

[Mantra]
Probably attract everything bad. It might chase things away.

[Manaia]
Don't want to deal with that.

[Rusk]
The loudest things... I'd love for things to run away from loud things. I need to find the anathema.

For my actual cause. There we go.

[Manaia]
The anathemas you put on your own sheet. Don't always have to be your god's ones. Those can be your personal ones.

[Rusk]
Okay.

[Manaia]
If it helps you keep track of what your god says to do.

[Rusk]
I have to follow both my gods and my causes?

[Manaia]
You have to follow your gods. You can choose to have your own personal ones. You do not need to have them.

But you can choose to. The personal ones you don't have to follow. They're yours.

[Rusk]
Here's my big question. For my champion's cause. It has an edict here.

Do I have to follow that edict? Or just my gods?

[Manaia]
What does your edict say?

[Rusk]
Subvert or corrupt everything in your path that is pure or holy. Complete atheistic. Anti-religion is the way I thought.

[Mantra]
It's worse than being atheist. You have to be a red atheist.

[Rusk]
So doubt among those holding ideals of purity or holiness.

[Manaia]
You're like a counter-church sort of thing. Do you have to do it for your champion? Genuinely here, I don't know.

I'm out of my element. I don't know if you have to do it. Or to keep your abilities.

Do you have to? There we go. As long as we don't take you to a church.

Or a temple or anything. It should be fine.

[Rusk]
It's actually pretty simple. Gorim is easy to follow. My character is using a divine spell.

I'm using divine spells. Keep that in mind.

[Kuji]
If you have an edict and an athema. You need to do that. If you violate those.

It can potentially cause you to lose your powers or class abilities. Unless you do the atoning ritual. Oh god.

[Manaia]
I've just read Gorim's edict and athemas. Those are pretty good, honestly.

[Rusk]
Oh, he's dead.

[Manaia]
We're missing. Ignore what I said. Not in this canon.

Sorry, I was just looking at the category he was in. He's fine. Isn't he dead?

That's what I said. Immediately interrupted myself. No, he's fine.

[Mantra]
He's doing great.

[Manaia]
In this world, he's okay.

[Kuji]
There is different degrees. Just because you have an edict. Doesn't mean you need to blindly follow it.

You see a flower there. You can poison that flower. Killing that flower will cause danger.

You don't have to. Absolutely. Follow that thing.

But you need to work towards it. You can't blindly ignore it. I can't kill that flower directly.

But I can poison the water that's going to be poured onto it.

[Manaia]
There we go. Again, I have read Gorim's edicts and anathemas. They're pretty good for working well with a team.

10 out of 10. It's basically, don't be evil.

[Rusk]
I somehow managed to find evil things. That are not evil enough.

[Manaia]
I believe it's because it's one of those. Lawful evil type things. Where they have their own internal rules.

Even though they might be devious.

[Mantra]
We also scrolled through every shield boss and shield spike. They're super evil. Apparently, using shields is super evil.

[Manaia]
I thought a shield would be inherently good. You're protecting foes.

[Mantra]
You must kill everything in your sight. Christ. That was a real one, by the way.

[Speaker 6]
We go to a church.

[Kuji]
Do you really trust that god?

[Manaia]
You don't have to trash the place. But you can start converting away.

[Kuji]
Your god will support baby Hitler.

[Mantra]
Non-believer says what?

[Kuji]
Do you really want to support a god that'll help Hitler?

[Manaia]
Aye yai yai. It's like that. Nice token.

You good, James?

[James]
Sorry, I'm just texting back medical staff people.

[Manaia]
Oh, no problem. I was just wondering, you looked a bit concerned.

[James]
I am concerned, because I'm going to go nuclear on these people.

[Manaia]
Fair enough.

[James]
Burhihi, can I ask you to run a combat encounter outside the front door here? Inside the front door.

[Kuji]
I am currently running my computer, I'm sorry.

[James]
It's okay if you can't. I know I'm asking this for a moment.

[Kuji]
We'll be able to do something in just a minute.

[James]
I'm going to finish texting these people, and then I'm going to go grab my coffee. Then I'm going to be back.

[Kuji]
I can run something in the meantime if you'd like.

[James]
If you can, no pressure, but if you can, that'd be amazing. I'll be back. Goddamn, they always do this in the dumbest fucking time.

[Manaia]
Random thing, don't you think it's very lucky that most fires that happen are within the visible spectrum? Of light, I mean. They're very few, though.

[Mantra]
Let me think about that, actually.

[Manaia]
Yeah, there's some fires, I think it's like hydrogen fires that we can't see. But those are very, very rare. They usually happen in science labs.

[Kuji]
I think it's also ethanol, as well.

[Mantra]
Well, if it's a fire we can't see, would we even classify it as a fire?

[Manaia]
Well, the thing is, if you touch it, you will find out very soon. Because, you know, the clouds burning will be in the visible spectrum.

[Mantra]
Yeah, but I don't think people have come up with a new name for that. Because the scientific definition of fire and the colloquial understanding don't really match up. That's true, that's true.

So we just call it a chemical explosion instead of a fire, even though we're burning stuff.

[Manaia]
Well, that's a fun fact I learned. Usually if, say, there's a loose fire because of a gas leak or something, and they can't see it, people tend to hold broomsticks in front of them. If it catches a light, there's the leak.

[Mantra]
Yeah, they just use a stick.

[Manaia]
Yeah, most effective.

[Kuji]
Yeah, they use a straw broom. A lot of the factories that do it, they'll have a straw broom available that you can just wave in front of.

[Mantra]
Yeah, people don't call gas leaks fires, though. They're more like...

[Manaia]
No, no, gas leaks are separate from fires, though. Because you can have a gas leak without a fire. I mean, specifically gas leaks that are causing...

[Mantra]
I'm pretty sure the fire would just be visible.

[Manaia]
It depends. Bless you.

[Kuji]
Just waiting for the battery to load.

[Manaia]
As one does. If you want silence filled, I can give you fun facts.

[Kuji]
Just trying to open the soda can. If you'd like to roll initiative.

[Manaia]
Ooh, yay.

[Rusk]
Hold up, I do have, like... I guess a question, but...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah?

[Rusk]
I was gonna ask it here, because we have some downtime to just chill. While we wait for James. So, what type of...

What type of downtime actions do I have?

[Mantra]
All of them take a day or more. But usually there's a few weeks.

[Manaia]
Hold on, let me just get the thing. Ah, downtime. There's a whole...

There's a whole thing. Here's the link in voice overflow. The most common one is rent income.

There we go.

[Rusk]
Is there, like, a sheet within Foundry itself?

[Manaia]
I don't know.

[Kuji]
I don't think there's... I don't know if it's in Foundry, I don't know that. I normally just use the Pathfinder Archives of Nethis.

And if you select downtime activities, it has a full list of activities. There's also, if you want to do something custom, a lot of times you're more than welcome to discuss what you want to do.

[Rusk]
Oh, to get them sweet gains.

[Manaia]
Sorry, what was sweet gains?

[Rusk]
Stay swole or get rolled. Okay.

[Kuji]
Everyone rolled initiative.

[Rusk]
Oh shit, did I roll initiative? I don't think I did.

[Mantra]
Am I supposed to put my token down in the hidden bar?

[Manaia]
Yes, down here. Do you see where I'm pinging?

[Mantra]
Yeah, okay, I'll put it there.

[Manaia]
Ah, Ver did the cooler ping.

[Kuji]
Boss ping.

[Manaia]
We get it, you have the cooler one. I do want to note, Mantra, you have landed on someone.

[Mantra]
He just needed an extra hundred pound weight while he was doing his fishups, don't worry about it.

[Manaia]
Oh yes, of course. It makes sense, just, like, sit on his back.

[Mantra]
Exactly. And that's the only way you can really treat wounds while he's moving, right?

[Manaia]
Oh yes, of course.

[Kuji]
If everyone's comfortable, as you guys get to the bluff, you guys start to get there, yadda yadda, walking around. Everyone's about to enter the door. Just as you're about to enter, though, you see a goblin comes up to you.

He's like, aaaah! Painful, painful! And he'll run up, and there's three people in front of him, so I'm just going to go roll, left to right, middle.

He sees Rusk, and he's going to pull out his weapon, and he's going to swing his horsechopper at you. He goes, nyah! Aw, knacker.

[Rusk]
It got me. What if I just, like, sound extremely Scottish?

[Mantra]
Can you keep that up?

[Rusk]
I'm going to use Selfish. I can use Reaction, right? Or do I have to?

So I'm going to do this, drag the effect onto me, and then reduce that damage by three. I'm only taking eight points of damage, and my next attack will deal more damage to him. He is not ready.

[Kuji]
Perfect. And then Mantra's turn.

[Mantra]
Alright, so Mantra's going to stride here. Oh, hello! Oh, a really cool thing.

[Kuji]
I'll just interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. If you actually go into the Journal section, there's the Party tab, and at the very top there's a Party Sheet.

And if you click on it, it'll give you options to do exploration activities, so it'll give you passive bonuses, so if you do scouting, stealthing, things like that, it'll give you bonuses to fit your initiative role. And it also has the overview of the party, to look at what skills you have, party skills and party knowledges, as well as languages.

[Mantra]
Thank you. Is there a reason why you can't press P to see it? I swear there's a macro for that.

Maybe not here. I don't know about a shortcut. That might not be useful.

So they are going to stride, they are going to inner upheaval Mr. Goblin over here. And they're going to poke poke twice. So once is a critical miss.

They'll do a heal point on that. There we go. For 13 damage.

It's also hidden.

[Kuji]
Yep.

[Mantra]
16. And then for their last action, they are going to stride the hell back. Get back!

You managed to kill the Goblin.

[Speaker 6]
Woohoo!

[Kuji]
Next you'll see this other Goblin. Other Goblin runs out. He shrieks out something.

Mantra, you understand that. He goes, no! Jeffrey, you killed him!

And... He's going to chase after you. He's like, eh!

And he's going to do a strike against you. With his dog slicer. Missing!

Mania's turn. Mania's turn.

[Manaia]
Yippee! Well, I've just seen them attack a new friend. That is terrible.

We are going to try to vaporize the nerd. I want to test out new skills I got. And he's in standing distance.

So... Versus living.

[Kuji]
You do one or two actions.

[Manaia]
Oh, two actions. Oh wait, no, one action. Sorry, because it doesn't affect how much damage it does.

So, one action.

[Mantra]
Oh, there's two actions on your team. Did you want to do the save?

[Manaia]
Oh, right. You do the save. I'm hurting you.

[Kuji]
Yeah, but that way I get to do the little button. And it rolls for me.

[Manaia]
That is a shame. I rolled so high. Okay, so that is one action of doing that.

Now I'm going to, well... Needle darts. Yippee!

Damage. Yippee! Yay!

The creature is dead.

[Kuji]
Koochie's going to attack. Hold his... What's Koochie got?

[Manaia]
Wait, sorry, did I end my turn? I did not. There we go.

[Kuji]
Koochie's going to go up there and use his action to attack anything that comes nearby. Come on, commandos! This one goes out there and he does a shriek.

[Speaker 6]
Ah!

[Kuji]
Koochie will do his attack. Claw, missing. And this is going to attack the closest guy.

Who's just attacked him. Honey. Manae is able to hear it.

You guys all hear some shrieking noises. Manae's like, no, my friends and buddies! No!

Amazing. Failing. First turn.

[Rusk]
Alright. When do you stride? Here?

[Mantra]
Don't mind the corpses.

[Rusk]
What?

[Mantra]
The one with the skull on the top left of heart event.

[Rusk]
Oh yeah, I know what the skull means. Alright, and then I'm going to use... Everstand stance.

Do I actually have this up? I do not. How do I use this?

Oh, I apply effect. Okay. So is the door open?

Or do I have to...

[Kuji]
Door's open, yeah, you stand in the doorway. Alright. That's a hit.

[Rusk]
Five points of damage you take!

[Kuji]
Looks a little bit bloodied.

[Rusk]
Hey, don't growl at me, I said I'm nice. Alright, that's my turn.

[Kuji]
And then down at the bottom of the insta-bar you should have end turn.

[Mantra]
Okay. Okay. So Mantra is going to try and tumble through.

Why are they not... Okay, I forgot to add my... Let me just add that real quick.

Okay, so there I'm going to try and tumble through. Whee! That is a success.

So they're just going to shoulder-check this little goblin on their way to the other side. That is 30 feet. That's 25, yep.

Yep. And then they're going to Flurry of Flows. And they're going to hopefully pop off this goblin's head.

[Kuji]
The head is dead. That hurts. And I believe that James is back.

[Mantra]
Woo!

[Manaia]
Manaia is going to steal the goblin's contents of their pockets.

[Mantra]
Oh, we're going to run their pockets? Okay.

[Kuji]
Yeah, you should be able to click on their bodies.

[Manaia]
I'll put it in the party sheet so we can divide it later.

[Mantra]
This is smart. I need to make a shortcut for the party sheet reading.

[Manaia]
Though in all honesty, Manaia is very, very likely to just pocket some things. But she's being generous today.

[Rusk]
To the victor this boils.

[Kuji]
Gonna eat good tonight.

[Rusk]
You're going to eat the earth. I like how even though I have an ability called Selfish Shield, my character doesn't actually need to be selfish.

[Mantra]
So the reason they're called that is because every other champion reaction works when you hit someone else other than the user. So those are selfless. Because they only work when you hit someone that's not you.

And then that one's selfish because it only works when they hit you. So I guess you just don't care enough if we get hurt, so it's selfish. Yeah.

Okay, so we looted their pockets. We have learned the lessons of their woman. In contrast to Rust's aggressive workout, Mantra's refocusing is just like light stretching.

Like just hamstring stretches, a little backbending. Nice. More like yoga than a workout.

[Manaia]
Nice. Well, Manaia's going to lead the way once you're done with the focusing. Just going to hop in.

She remembers this treasure here.

[Mantra]
So much treasure.

[Manaia]
So much treasure. You just can't recall exactly where it is. You might just want to stop her from invading stuff, but you have to be careful.

[James]
Which there is, the giant snake is still on the second level. Sorry, on the top level.

[Manaia]
We do not want that. We are going down the stairs, down to the second level. The giant snake will eat us all.

It will be embarrassing. Down we go.

[James]
Downwards you guys can actually hear a loud rumbling sound that kind of sounds like a machine. And Dwarven cries for help.

[Mantra]
So which way is downstairs?

[James]
If you guys want to go downstairs, I will drag you to the second level.

[Mantra]
Okay. I guess we're going to rush straight downstairs then.

[Manaia]
I'll pick you on the stairs.

[Rusk]
Carry the corpse of the goblin with us.

[Mantra]
We leave the snake alone. We're using the corpse as a cart. In this first room, there are giant centipedes.

[James]
Awesome. And the water is filled with like a... There we go.

[Kuji]
Are these beasts or monstrosities? That can wait. The water is two feet deep.

[James]
They are animals. I don't know.

[Kuji]
I said, hey buddies, do you really want to hurt me?

[James]
I can do a reaction check.

[Kuji]
They do. They do really want to hurt you. Alright, then it's time to go.

[James]
You can make... One of the animals will give you time to make your case. I mean, you can make a check.

It's not going to... No, it's not going to improve it beyond hostile.

[Kuji]
No, no. It's my anathema to wildly attack animals. So if they are aggressive, you know, they're not giving me a chance.

It's not a problem. We can go.

[Rusk]
And Rastun are on the ship. I did it!

[James]
Those you see around the doors, they're a bunch of smaller centipedes beginning to crawl. Centipedes swarm over the ride at the top of the next round. But first, we have this one.

He's going to run over and bite. And bite it shall not. It will try to bite a second time.

Hey, hey, hey! There we go. Where'd it go?

[Rusk]
Oh. I rolled into that thing. Alright, go ahead and make your fourth save.

[James]
There we go. It will take several damage that easy, but this thing's turned tough out to rust.

[Rusk]
Alright, so you said there's... You said there's, like, giant centipedes that are on their way?

[James]
Oh, hell no.

[Rusk]
Alright, uh... I'm going to stride. And I am going to...

How do I raise my shield? That. Perfect.

I'm going to raise my shield. And I will... Strike.

Miss. I didn't know these centipedes were agile.

[Kuji]
I'm going to do a little shucky-shucky. As I do a little electrical arc.

[Mantra]
I thought the centipedes were faster than the electric arc, but... I got me some real centipedes.

[James]
Remember, you can target them, and then click roll damage, and that will give me the...

[Rusk]
You can target them both, and then click roll damage. You can target them both. Shit.

[James]
Nope. Oh, nope. You have to hold shift, and then while you're holding shift, you press T on each of them.

Yeah.

[Mantra]
Yes. Perfect.

[James]
That was a fail. That was a T.

[Kuji]
And then I'm going to give my last action for... Kaiju to do a little... Bitey-bite.

[James]
Hey! 18 damage. You give him two actions, right?

[Mantra]
Yep. No, that's only for... No, that is correct, yeah.

For handle components. Yep. So could they...

[James]
I mean, assuming that thing didn't survive, could he have hit it twice?

[Mantra]
Yes.

[James]
Oh, hell yeah. I want to play that.

[Mantra]
Alright. You could also have him move some more. Mantra.

[Kuji]
Yeah, nah, he's good to stay.

[Mantra]
Let's see, who goes next? Centipede. Okay.

And they're going to step forward. They are going to do a Flurry of Blows.

[Speaker 7]
Wee. Wee.

[Mantra]
That is going to be a miss and a miss, and they are going to stride back. Wee. They have the Quick Jump feat, so they can just jump the river.

And then they're going to end their turn.

[James]
Oh, it's not like a river, there's a...

[Mantra]
staircase. I see. These are separate floors, so I just have a...

Oh, I just Warp Reality. Okay, I'm going to go here instead.

[James]
No worries, no worries.

[Mantra]
I cannot move back. I've created a prison in which I cannot escape. Can you move my token back?

[James]
It's totally... You can just be on the stairs, it's fine.

[Mantra]
Okay, it's fine.

[James]
You're fine. Attacking Raze.

[Rusk]
That's not very nice. I'm going to... Okay, I'll do this first.

[James]
Are you going to use the reaction for the half damage thing?

[Rusk]
I'm going to use Shield Block to completely negate the damage.

[Kuji]
Does that mean he doesn't take the Fort Safe?

[James]
I think it does, meaning that he does not take the Fort Safe. If I click Block... Yeah, what's the Shield's Hardness?

[Rusk]
Shield's Hardness is 5.

[James]
Alright, that's higher than 3. Wait, no, what am I doing? I have two attacks left.

Well, I have one attack left. Fuck. Manaia!

Muted!

[Manaia]
Right, thank you. I have been stepped on. This is a calamity.

We're just going to hit the things with darts. Actually, you know what? Let me be more helpful than that.

We're going... Darts. Needle's attack.

Oh, sick. Roll damage. Decent.

Then we're going to roll Stoke the Heart again and give it to to Rusk. There we go. It's time.

And that will be my turn.

[Rusk]
Oh, it's already my turn.

[James]
Hooray!

[Rusk]
Feels like the turns go by a lot faster. They can.

[Mantra]
They can. That's because they're making less attacks in general, I think.

[Rusk]
I'm going to use Everstand's Dance. I just have to click use. I'll get used to this eventually.

And then I'm going to attack there. And then I'm going to raise my shield. And that is my turn.

[Mantra]
Rahiki, it's your turn. I have to end my turn.

[Kuji]
It's his turn. Do a little zappy zappy as I point towards him with double fingers and goes...

[James]
I didn't play that damage. Whoops. Wait, what?

Oh no, it's not. You didn't have to expend your electric art. It is dead.

[Kuji]
Ah. No wonder why it's not rolling.

[James]
I don't know why you rolled... Because I saw that you rolled twice and I was like, what? You got low damage on the second one.

Oh.

[Kuji]
I'm going to move back a little bit. And I'm going to get little Kuji to hold his action in case anything comes nearby. It's going to bite.

[James]
Nah, nothing else is going to come out.

[Kuji]
No swarm?

[James]
Nope. Yeah, it's killed the other one too quickly.

[Speaker 6]
Yippee!

[Kuji]
They were too scared. The children don't want to come out to feast.

[Manaia]
So, uh... Do the level ones get double?

[Kuji]
No.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
You just get half. I suppose...

[Manaia]
I throw a tomato at you, but please imagine that.

[Kuji]
They're pretty easy to count on, in a row.

[Manaia]
Knock knock. Where would you guys like to go next?

[Kuji]
At first... They are far in this direction. It looks like our little buddy here is a little bit hurt.

[Mantra]
Can we take a breather just to... Yes! Alright.

If Kuji has a better medicine than plus four, Mantra can let them borrow her healer's kit for a bit.

[Kuji]
Kuji also has a healer's kit in the shape of a dinner set.

[Manaia]
I... Oh! I can heal you guys.

I turn around and heal.

[James]
Ten minutes? Ten minutes? Ooh, unfortunate.

You need to guys to add yourselves back to the encounter.

[Manaia]
Okay. Oh, shit. Fellas, I can heal you next time with a spell.

[Kuji]
If they'd be, we could heal him up, but...

[Rusk]
So, for some reason, whenever I use Everstand stance, it's giving me four shield hardness instead of just two.

[Mantra]
I think that's just part of the ability. Let me see.

[Rusk]
It's supposed to increase the shield's hardness by two. It might be because I have two shields in my inventory.

[Mantra]
Oh, you might want to delete one. Or do you have one as an active shield?

[Rusk]
Yeah, one is an active shield.

[Mantra]
Maybe try moving one to like...

[Manaia]
Are you carrying both of them?

[Rusk]
Uh, yes. I have one, like...

[Manaia]
You might want to unequip one of them if you're not supposed to be. Unless you are building shields, in which case...

[Rusk]
That would actually be funny. But no, that's not how Everstand stance works. I can only...

I have to two-hand it. So... Could it be interfering with the shield boss?

[Kuji]
Like, leave the road really good, or really scarily.

[Manaia]
Has the creatures of our nightmares appeared?

[James]
No, no, I have to do a bunch of... Go ahead and take like a 5-10 minute break, because I have to... I have to justify the inventory.

[Manaia]
Appearing? Okay.

[Mantra]
Alright.

[Manaia]
That's concerning. Let's hope we don't die. Good luck, everyone.

[Mantra]
Joke's on you, I bought a potion of emergency escape. Good for you.

[Manaia]
Oh, sorry, a what of emergency escape?

[Mantra]
Potion of emergency escape. So I can down it, and then I can do...

[Manaia]
Delightful. Anyway, next time, either before or after we defeat these folks, I can heal you. I have enough spells.

I have taken enough wands.

[Rusk]
Alright, I will be right back.

[Manaia]
No problem.

[Kuji]
I also have healing.

[Manaia]
There we go. Instant healing. Much faster than waiting for things to sneak up on us, but...

At the very least, a new one.

[Kuji]
You said you had a healing wand? Like, plural?

[Manaia]
Yes. No, I have one heal wand, one harm wand, and I do have, like, heal the spell prepared, so...

[Kuji]
That was very supportive.

[Manaia]
Well, Divine Spell... Can you cast Divine Spells?

[Kuji]
I can cast Primal Spells, which has healing. Oh, yeah.

[Manaia]
I... When I was getting those wands, I was the only person who could cast Divine, so... No one else had the trick.

Yeah. Looting! Hey!

No, when we're dividing the spoils of war. Yes, looting.

[Kuji]
James, are you saying these creatures have, like, a staff? Yeah?

[James]
What's up?

[Kuji]
Do you say these creatures have a cool staff? A nature staff?

[James]
A cool nature staff? What would a ranger want with a nature staff?

[Kuji]
I found this really cool stick. I used it for a walking stick. It's just a plus-five magical staff of...

[Mantra]
something. You got the plus-three apex item, greater striking, greater blazing, just flying around. Cool stick.

[Kuji]
Turns out luck is my best stat.

[Manaia]
The only... The greater thing I have managed to stave off was a doorknob. That's it.

[Kuji]
Runeworld's new DLC came out.

[Manaia]
Ooh, nice.

[Kuji]
Odyssey. It's a spaceship one, where you build your spaceship and you can travel around the system.

[Manaia]
Nice. Oh. I've got to fill up my water bottle, so I will deck, but that sounds awesome.

So, see you in five... Five? Ten minutes?

Mm-hmm.

[Mantra]
Okay.

[Kuji]
Ooh, Dungeon Alchemist also had an update.

[James]
Am I crazy, or is there a... Is there a, uh... Huh.

Is there an item that lets you... Or is there a rune that lets you switch damage value from, like, instead of using dexterity, or instead of using strength for attacks, you use dexterity?

[Mantra]
No. That does not exist. Ah, dang it.

What's for a rune? Thief Rogue. Let me send it in voiceover form.

[James]
What's the... What's a trait for... Is it the finesse trait?

[Mantra]
That, uh... Finesse, you use only dexterity for your attack rolls. Your damage rolls are still basic.

Right. Thief changes that, so your melee weapons with finesse also use dexterity for damage.

[James]
Oh, interesting.

[Mantra]
But only for melee attacks with melee weapons. If you throw it, it just goes back to being dexterity and strength.

[Rusk]
Alright, I'm back.

[James]
Now the last thing is I have to look over the fucking roof.

[Mantra]
Ah.

[James]
Alright, that's enough waiting while I... get ready for the big nonsense.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[James]
Oh, good luck, everybody. This will not be a moderate encounter.

[Manaia]
It won't be a moderate encounter?

[James]
No. I don't think so.

[Manaia]
Will it be harder?

[Mantra]
I don't think so.

[Manaia]
Oh, no.

[Mantra]
You forgot to end the current encounter, by the way.

[Kuji]
No. No, no, we got experience. I think you need to start the new one, though.

[Manaia]
I have not started the new one, that's correct.

[James]
I added it to the initiative, but I did not, uh... And we started with a... 20 for initiative, which I think...

Pretty, uh...

[Manaia]
Good luck, everyone.

[Rusk]
Well, friends, it's been nice knowing you.

[Manaia]
Remember, running is valid. If it looks too bad, it's hard.

[Mantra]
Just don't leave me to die. Oh, well, I don't think Rusk is going to be able to run very far.

[Manaia]
Rusk, are you allowed to run?

[Rusk]
I do not run.

[Manaia]
Oh, yeah, also...

[Mantra]
I suppose they're going to delay. Ooh, there's a delay button.

[Manaia]
I know you know a lot of the word, but, um... Oh, there is no one there. Well, I guess I will also delay to, like, see someone.

Just after later.

[Kuji]
Something seems... off.

[Mantra]
Yeah.

[Kuji]
Something...

[Mantra]
Something is wrong, I can feel it. There's the disturbance in the forest.

[Manaia]
The vibes are off.

[Rusk]
Bad vibes, question mark.

[Manaia]
Alright, where's Benaiah?

[Mantra]
Uh, I think Rusk is... Yeah, Rusk is sitting on here.

[James]
I hope he doesn't unsub. I've been revealed. Oh, no.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Mantra]
What the fuck is that?

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Mantra]
Yeah, that's a really nice, uh, mohawk.

[Manaia]
Oh, yes.

[Kuji]
I don't know if people can see something that I can't see. Oh, ah. Benaiah.

[Manaia]
Yes? Oh. What the fuck?

Is there any save?

[James]
There is. Yeah, but... What the fuck happened?

I heard a thing.

[Manaia]
Have I been vanquished? Where am I?

[James]
Oh, there's...

[Mantra]
I didn't put a, uh... I guess I didn't put the save in there. The attack is so powerful, you just faded without a save.

[Rusk]
You just got disintegrated next to me. It's like a beam, just fucking... You just got beamed.

Bring!

[Kuji]
You're not gonna pause this check, just... Just die. Just don't take the frick down.

[Manaia]
Okay. Oh, hold on. Oho.

[James]
That's a failure.

[Manaia]
Ow. Okay, uh, regular... Regular damage.

Yes, yeah. Give me a second.

[James]
Why is it not... Do we see what happens?

[Manaia]
It's not letting me...

[James]
When I press it.

[Manaia]
Is it damaging me? It's not letting me damage myself. There you go.

Oh, there we go.

[Kuji]
I don't know what happened. Do we see what's happened?

[James]
Yep, we see a beam of force that runs through, and then we're gonna have... We're gonna command the hippocampus to...

[Manaia]
Hello, let it go. Nee!

[James]
You know what? I'd force it to...

[Manaia]
Yeah.

[James]
No, first we're...

[Manaia]
Okay, remember, target the lady, and not the horse. Because the lady controls her.

[Kuji]
Crikey, that thing is a lady.

[Mantra]
A lady? No, our toughest challenge yet. Woman.

[Manaia]
Anywho. It's a good thing that hit me, and not any of you guys.

[Mantra]
Apparently, the beam was so powerful, it forced you out of initiative. You're gone. It kicked me out of the game.

It was ridiculous.

[James]
Why were you kicked out of initiative? What the fuck is going on?

[Mantra]
I don't know! Who was pressing buttons? I'm gonna kill you.

Game's found dead. I'll let you two reset.

[Manaia]
I was right after Lady Te... Teogur. Because I delayed my turn.

Wait, will it let me return to initiative? I'll click that later, I guess.

[James]
I already put you on...

[Kuji]
I put you on there. You're on there. Nobody pressed anything.

I didn't. I would've pressed this button. Don't touch that button.

We're not...

[Rusk]
What does this red button do?

[Kuji]
You know how we don't go to the second level because of that crazy mum stuff? This is why we're down now.

[Manaia]
It is my turn. We are trying to defeat the evil. Um...

Does anyone else have healing abilities? Nope. No?

Nope. Okay. I'm level one.

Okay, Vir? If I go down, please put me back up. Thank you.

[Mantra]
Why did you roll initiative again?

[James]
We just had a... No. Abs...

Nope. Take your turn. Ignore that question.

[Manaia]
I'm taking my turn. That's what we're doing. Roll damage.

Oh, that is terrible damage! Okay, that's fine.

[James]
Oh, it also affects the...

[Kuji]
The hippocampus.

[Manaia]
Yes, as long as they are alive.

[James]
They are indeed. No, that's bullshit.

[Manaia]
Oh, thank the stars! Okay. And, um...

Then immediately, who's after me? It's... It's his mantra!

I'm going to give you the fun spell. Hold on. Stoke the heart.

Here you go. And restore its spirit to myself. Okay.

That is my turn.

[Mantra]
Mantra's just going to delay again for flanking, I guess.

[Manaia]
Attack the creature! What are you doing?

[Kuji]
Kuchikas! Rooting bloody on Kaiju. Kaiju's going to run to the back.

Sneak behind and do a little...

[Mantra]
Num! Oh, could you move a bit to the left? Thank you.

[Kuji]
Rough.

[Manaia]
Mantra, you have to be one down, I think? Like, either here, where the giant centipede was, to get the flanking. Oh, you're targeting her.

Never mind, ignore me.

[James]
Lemon, I think you're muted.

[Manaia]
Lemon, you're muted.

[Mantra]
Lemon! I was muted the whole time? Yes!

So I did the bonk-bonk, and then I'm going to end my turn.

[James]
Good, alright. You see Lidgar Tiogar get knocked down, but still on the saddle. She appears to have died.

And there is a nasty light coming from her.

[Mantra]
Oh, did I see that? For the first two strikes, then? Sorry, what?

So after I struck twice...

[James]
Wait, just briefly, don't interrupt me while I'm giving that description. That's not good. Sorry.

That's bad. Now, what was your question?

[Mantra]
Okay, so she emitted this nasty light after she apparently died? Yes. So after my action to strike her twice, I would have been able to see this?

While I was still on my turn? Yeah.

[James]
Yeah, and you would still have an action left if you wanted to move or go somewhere else.

[Mantra]
Yeah. So I'm just going to get the fuck out then. So this is five...

That is... Oh, I'm sorry, it's not my turn yet. Could it be back to my turn so I could move?

[James]
I could just move you somewhere.

[Mantra]
Okay. Where do you want to go? Can you see my...

Where do you want to go? I'm trying to ping it. You don't have to...

Nevermind.

[Speaker 6]
You don't have to kill the wall.

[James]
The last attack was a miss, so it's... Doesn't matter. Here, go ahead and move yourself.

[Mantra]
That is 25 feet as they walk around the corner. What wall am I moving around? Oh, that's...

Okay, so this would be... The wall that's pictured. Why is it saying that color?

Yeah, so that is 25 feet and they're going to be good there.

[Speaker 6]
Alrighty.

[James]
Yep. Okay, good. The campus is going to...

Oh, this is pretty cool.

[Kuji]
Can it swim and land?

[James]
It's not on land. Oh, it hit Minaya. Minaya takes damage.

It was rude. I agree.

[Manaia]
And it unpicks the body? No!

[James]
And it takes the body.

[Manaia]
Ah! Dang it.

[James]
How far... Do you go through the... No, it's going to have plenty.

It's going to start swimming down the elevator. Elevator shaft.

[Manaia]
She'll never know what was in her pockets.

[James]
I wouldn't say never.

[Manaia]
Okay, that is very suspicious. She died very quickly and we're still in initiative. Okay.

[Kuji]
Would you... I hadn't chosen.

[James]
Does somebody have a question? What's up?

[Kuji]
No. What? I'm seeing what's in the pocket.

No!

[Manaia]
Yippee! It! We did not die!

Oh, thank god. Max healing. Okay.

[Kuji]
Why would you waste that spell for? Why?

[Manaia]
I am here.

[Kuji]
I'm just saying, why would you waste a spell for? I'll heal you up.

[Manaia]
Okay. I imagine that we are in imminent danger. We can still explore, but like...

How much healing can you do?

[Kuji]
Do some heals.

[Manaia]
Okay. Does anyone else want to explore further in? After I get less damaged?

[Kuji]
Should we do a trait runes?

[Manaia]
Sure. But that takes 10 minutes, and then we'll be in the same situation we were beforehand.

[Kuji]
I can do battle medicine.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
I need healing.

[Manaia]
Because Rez needs more healing than I do, I believe.

[Kuji]
I can do battle medicine, which is quick.

[Manaia]
Yeah, do battle medicine on Rez, and then you can do one on me a bit later. And then we... Oh!

Good golly gosh. And then we can explore the rest of the dungeon if you're all up to that.

[Kuji]
A little bit of battle medicine. That's gonna... That is a token.

[Manaia]
Oh, there we go.

[Kuji]
26. So, Rusk, if you'd like to... Ooh, receive that healing.

[Rusk]
How do I apply healing? Yep. Oh, there it is.

[Manaia]
There we go.

[Rusk]
All right, full health. Nice!

[Manaia]
Nice. You can heal me later, presumably when I get hit in the face.

[Kuji]
Yeah, if you need a bit more healing.

[Manaia]
Let's see, how much am I passed by? I need 12 healing to be to full, but otherwise I have 24. Battle medicine!

So, hello! So, folks, would you like to go explore the rest of the dungeon, or are you all tuckered out?

[Kuji]
Should we maybe try to follow that creature? Make sure they don't come back?

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
Might be a good idea. Through the elevator?

[Manaia]
The elevator has lots of evil nixings, but if you're up to it, I... I perhaps would slightly advise against it, but if we are going...

[Mantra]
We didn't go through, maybe we should... Mantra just points out me to the left.

[Manaia]
Ooh, there are frogs. I believe. Usually nice.

Usually. But we don't have to go down the elevator, there are also bits up. There are other things over here as well.

So frogs over here, more adventure over here. Not necessarily down the elevator. This is Minaya talking, not me.

So... Where would you guys like to go? If you do not choose, we're going right.

Oh, frogs? Okay.

[Mantra]
Then...

[Manaia]
We're going this way?

[Mantra]
Did someone open the door?

[Manaia]
Someone opened the door. I think that was... Let's go that way then.

[Speaker 6]
Okay!

[Manaia]
Wait, are we opening the...

[James]
Towards the machine sound, or are you exploring elsewhere?

[Manaia]
Oh! Towards the machine sound of Dwarven danger. No, that's to the left.

Oh, okay. To the left then. I thought there were frogs in that direction.

I suppose I am wrong.

[Kuji]
Are you across? When that person was unconscious, did they drop their items? Like, their weapons?

[Mantra]
Nope. Conveniently left a bag of stuff.

[Kuji]
No, no, just say if you fall unconscious, you do drop your weapon.

[Mantra]
Okay.

[Kuji]
Did that previous person drop their weapon? That sexy, sexy spear? Nope.

[Manaia]
Alas. Okay, um, we opened the door? Nothing, okay.

Next door. Oh, hold on, let me vanquish my bird. Alright, and then...

[Rusk]
Creep into the room with a bird on my shoulder.

[Manaia]
Oh yes, I like that imagery. I'm on your shoulder now. I hop off there.

I like to feel tall. Alright. Pets you fly?

I cannot fly very far. And unfortunate, couldn't this run.

[Rusk]
Hey James, do any of these rooms have anything in them? Are they empty, like...

[James]
So the one that you guys were next to... Oh, you guys just opened them. I should like, just put it on lock.

And like, let you guys move one thing at a time. It happens every time. Like, up, up, up, up, up.

[Rusk]
We should have turn-based movement.

[Manaia]
No, that would take forever. You can set a trigger to the lens. Okay.

In this room...

[James]
I'm in a wall. You do not see any sign of the frogs that you saw last time. There are still the corpses of the shriekers around.

They have yet to regrow. The next room over, you can hear pounding on a door. And the sound of the machine has gotten significantly louder.

[Manaia]
Whoa, exciting! Alright, who wants machine parts? Raise your hand.

That's everyone, okay. Regardless of if you've raised your hand or not, she's gonna take it as a confirmation.

[James]
The door is also locked.

[Manaia]
Oh! Okay.

[Kuji]
I did neglect it.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, you look strong. Door.

[Rusk]
Door.

[Mantra]
Door. And then... Mantra will try to aid the Force Open check.

[Rusk]
So is Force Open strength?

[Mantra]
Yeah, it's athletics, which you should have. I've got a crowbar here if you want. It'll help you out.

[Kuji]
I'll chuck you my crowbar.

[Manaia]
Well, there you go. Give you a little situational bonus.

[Rusk]
Player character giveth crowbar. Okay. Uh...

So do I add any bonuses to this?

[Mantra]
You make an athletic... You don't suffer a penalty. ...to the DC. And then... Oh yes, Mr. James?

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Mantra]
Can Mantra aid with athletics?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Okay.

[James]
Yeah, alright, so that will get past it. You will not be... Well, I see no reason to tell you about that, actually.

It's something that doesn't happen. But it exceeds.

[Rusk]
Ahoy, ladies.

[Manaia]
Hello. We are here to hear about the machine. What is going on?

Oh. Oh, there are so many. Oh, there are more than I thought there were.

Okay. Hello, ladies. Do you mind if we have these dwarves?

[James]
Uh, what language are you speaking, Miss Sim?

[Manaia]
Oh. What language do they speak? Let me see what languages I have.

The closest thing I have is Elven. Because I can't speak any sort of Fae. Elven is the closest thing to Fae I have.

Who can speak? Nobody in this party can speak Sylvan or Fae.

[James]
That is kind of funny. I don't think much is out of the ordinary.

[Rusk]
As a responsible person who's supposed to guide you, I think you should all stand behind me.

[Manaia]
Oh, yes, I'll speak in Dwarven then, since they're currently... ...accosting dwarves, and so I hope they understand it.

[Rusk]
Go ahead and roll.

[Manaia]
Okay. This is a diplomacy check?

[Rusk]
I thought you meant roll initiative. Ha ha ha.

[Manaia]
Can I roll society?

[James]
Let's get on it. So that... Oh, wait, no, that's an initiative.

[Manaia]
Society? What? Can I roll...

No, okay, diplomacy. Uh, please don't be bad. Please don't.

It's okay. Thank god.

[James]
They look... They were, like, at first confused. They're less enthusiastic about your presence now.

[Manaia]
Oh, no.

[James]
Wait, Russ, did you just roll initiative?

[Rusk]
Yeah, I accidentally rolled initiative, because when you said roll, I thought you meant roll initiative, not diplomacy.

[James]
I thought you were implying that you were, like, going to go straight at them? Not for Dwarven. Uh, the dwarves...

Without what is happening? So the dwarves on the other side, they hear somebody else speaking Dwarven, and they're like, Hey! Help!

[Speaker 6]
Kill these fucking things!

[Rusk]
Um... Guys, I think we should kill these fucking things. Slight idea.

We kill these fucking things, and then we go... Maybe not kill those fucking dwarves.

[Manaia]
Okay. Sure, why not? If you've rolled initiative, I imagine that's also you being like, Alright, we're fighting.

[James]
It's if you guys want to, uh... It's only if you guys want to do it.

[Manaia]
Uh... I'm going to try and understand what exactly is happening, so... They do understand me somewhat, so...

Can I ask what is happening here? In Dwarven, because again, I don't know...

[James]
Well, who are you asking?

[Manaia]
Well, I imagine I see a dwarf, and the Nixies don't understand me. Okay, I'm asking the Nixies what is happening, then, since the dwarves...

[James]
Yeah, they do not understand you, but like... What language are you... So the dwarves are in the other room, right?

They're up and to the left.

[Manaia]
Ah, okay. Okay. So they can't understand me regardless of what language I speak.

Cool. I will ask in Dwarven to the dwarves what's happening.

[James]
They can't understand the language that you're currently speaking. They don't speak Dwarven.

[Manaia]
They don't speak Dwarven? Or Elven? Or Common.

Okay. I don't share any languages with them. Oops, wrong button.

[Rusk]
How about we murder them?

[Manaia]
Common, Dwarven, Elven, Goblin, Orcish, I... Does anyone know any useful languages?

[Kuji]
No.

[Rusk]
Yeah, I speak murder. I think they'll understand that one.

[Manaia]
Okay, well...

[Kuji]
I speak in the language of my ancestors. And I speak some Urukshi.

[Rusk]
Speak with violence.

[Manaia]
Roll initiative if you wish to fight them.

[James]
At this point, you guys are... It's fucking time.

[Rusk]
It's a fucking staring competition.

[James]
And then you guys can take another 5-10 minute break while I get everything sorted here.

[Mantra]
I'm gonna add some loot. I'm just directing the entire time. I'm striking some poses.

[Rusk]
I'm sorry, but this whole situation just sounds funny in my head. You have, like, this bird trying to speak to these Nixies. And...

It's being completely incomprehensible. So they're probably just, like, staring in utter confusion. Like, looking back at each other.

[Kuji]
If you don't speak the languages, you also don't know what they're saying. So it's just like...

[Rusk]
I can just imagine at some point, they just get bored and are like, Alright, we're gonna kill these guys. Sorry, you were asking?

[Manaia]
I'm trying diplomacy, but alas. Of all the five languages, I know none of them.

[James]
There are people that you can speak to here that are just not the Nixies.

[Manaia]
What? Who are these guys?

[James]
No, there's dwarves. They heard you and they were responding in dwarvish.

[Manaia]
Yeah, that's what I... I did say earlier. Can I call out to the...

Okay, it must have been this.

[James]
But I did ask if I can ask the dwarves. The thing that we progressed was you asking the Nixies, What's going on here? And that was like...

[Manaia]
Yes, that's true. And nothing happened. Okay.

I'll be right back. I can ask the dwarves what's happening later. After, I suppose.

[Mantra]
It is too late. Okay, so we are fighting them now.

[Manaia]
We are fighting them. Diplomacy failed. Language barrier too strong.

And I was trying to ask the Nixies first before asking the dwarves. That was my bad.

[Speaker 6]
That's the problem.

[Manaia]
Yeah. I should have asked the dwarves straight away. So, now we're in a fight.

[Mantra]
Okay.

[Manaia]
To be fair, I don't think we could have bargained exactly with the Nixies. Since again, language barrier.

[Mantra]
I see.

[Manaia]
At least I know to take Fae next level.

[Mantra]
Okay. Wait, how do I join initiative? Okay, I remember how to join initiative now.

[Manaia]
Okay, not next level, but next time I can get a language. I have two other characters that can speak Fae. Not this one.

[Kuji]
Yeah, I'm very surprised I can't speak Fae on my druid, but then I remembered he's not very smart.

[Manaia]
Yeah. Unfortunately, intelligence is languages.

[Kuji]
My method is about Chilean.

[Manaia]
Do you get a language bonus? Like, a language specific for your ancestry?

[Kuji]
Rixi, which is lizard folk. Nice. And then Wildsong for druid.

[Manaia]
Nice.

[Kuji]
Let's see.

[Manaia]
What languages do my other characters... What other languages do I have? What languages do my other characters know?

Alright, so the other one knows Diabolos, Draconic, Fae, Gruton. Repeat what you said?

[Mantra]
I have to take another call. Go ahead.

[Kuji]
Ver knows Common, Draconic, Elven, Fae, Gnomish, and Isoki, which is the rat language.

[Manaia]
Oh, this is Ver the rat?

[Kuji]
Yeah. Nice. And then Hoot also knows Demonic, Draconic, Elven, Fae, Goblin.

[Manaia]
Nice. Let's see. The Doctor knows Common, Diabolic, Draconic, Fae, and Jotun.

Cammon knows Common and Fae. And Levant knows Common and the cat language Amuron.

[Kuji]
And then Leon also knows Elven and Fae.

[Manaia]
Nice.

[Kuji]
It seems like all my characters know Fae, except the one here.

[Manaia]
Oops, that's most unfortunate. You live, you learn. Nixies do live here a lot, so I guess that's just a reminder.

Get a translator and or a Fae speaker.

[Kuji]
Hello, would you like to learn about our Lord and Saviour? What?

[James]
That seems fitting.

[Rusk]
Sorry, did you say something?

[James]
I'm just talking to myself.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[James]
That's a lot of good shit.

[Rusk]
Okay, I guess.

[James]
Ring is not a trait, okay? If you insist. I feel like you're lying to me.

[Speaker 6]
Another one, okay.

[Rusk]
Alright, I'm back.

[James]
Oh, I know, I was supposed to recall that. You know, it's just that I'm 81. 81 is what I'm for.

Okay. Apparently there's a ring of energy resistance, but... I'll find it.

Electron resist.

[Rusk]
Cool, so all those aren't there. What?

[James]
Oh, neat, the text still shows up everywhere. Okay.

[Mantra]
Sorry, I missed what you said.

[James]
I was just talking to myself, noting that the text on the screen is actually still active. Okay. Okay.

It used to be that you could ban somebody after they left, but... It seems like that's not the case now.

[Kuji]
You can't do that anymore? Weird. What, in Discord or in Foundry?

[James]
In, uh, in Discord. I try to open it in Modview and it disappears immediately. Wait.

See, now I can... Now it lets me open people in Modview. That's so stupid that it...

I'll have to get, like, a Discord bot for it or something. Anyways, is everybody back, by the way?

[Rusk]
Yeah. Yes, I'm back.

[Mantra]
Were we waiting for someone?

[Kuji]
Uh...

[Mantra]
We could pick here.

[Manaia]
Hello! What has been said, what did I miss?

[Mantra]
I don't know.

[Rusk]
Oh, session's over, yeah.

[Kuji]
Yeah, we killed the big bad. We, uh, got the loot. It was a magical sphere.

[Mantra]
I can't be... I can't be... We took a nap in front of all these Nixies and we wake up the other guys.

[Manaia]
I'm here! Hello! Big witch!

Okay! What did I miss?

[James]
Nixie time!

[Rusk]
Yay!

[James]
Hello, Manaia!

[Manaia]
Hello! Oh, I see. You just hear, like, upset squawking.

Oh!

[James]
Don't add that damage. Apparently I have to roll for crit. Well, I...

I'm just doubling it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh!

[James]
That's awesome. That's like, uh, three crits I've had tonight.

[Manaia]
And I'm pushed back ten feet.

[James]
You are. It's true. Then we have another Nixie.

[Manaia]
Push me back! Push me back! Okay.

Thank you.

[James]
No, I wanted to leave you up there for a moment. Don't worry. Don't worry.

You'll be fine!

[Mantra]
Ah, that sucks.

[Rusk]
It just bounces off my armor.

[Mantra]
You're in fact fine.

[James]
I'll never stride over this way. Mantra! Whoops.

[Mantra]
Was Mantra muted? I was. Okay.

So Mantra is going to stride over here. They are going to stride thrice before it blows a normal strike. That's a hit.

Critical miss and a miss. Alright. So that is going to be the end of their turn.

Good damage though, geez.

[Manaia]
Ah, it is my turn. How you feeling, buddy? It is...

Yay! Okay, um... Do this one here.

We'll use my doorknob. I haven't gotten good use of my doorknob. We're going to cast the big spell.

Phantasmal Killer. Um... How does one cast this thing?

If only you would let me. Give me a second. Okay, I'm going to drag it onto my own sheet and then...

Hope it lets me. There. Just...

One. Going to drag that. Okay.

There. It is... It is a 27...

Will save. I can only do this one time, but...

[Speaker 6]
You should have done it with a horse.

[Manaia]
Yes, if I had remembered. But, you know, we had basically defeated it and then the horse vanished. Okay, so who has to...? This one, the banged up Nixie. Oh, only this one. Okay.

[James]
Oh, surprise, that failed.

[Manaia]
And it would be a correct failure, actually. Great. Yes, because...

This is from the doorknob. If you scroll a little bit. Anyway, it's a one time thing, so...

Let's hope it obliterates it. If only it would let me roll normal crit. Okay, I'll just roll the d4.

And then roll the extra d.

[James]
Well, it doubles the damage, because it failed.

[Manaia]
Oh, not double, not double, it would be... It has to roll a fortitude save.

[James]
It has to roll a fortitude save. Actually, let me just roll a fort save. The damage...

I don't know why I'm doing this. The damage is going to kill it. The damage is its max hit points.

[Manaia]
Oh, fantastic. Well, it's dead.

[James]
You see its form get ripped apart by a nightmare, which briefly manifests in physical reality.

[Manaia]
Yippee! And then, with my one action... That is exciting.

Thank you. And then, last action. Hopefully that demoralizes the nerds.

Here you go. You just went. I should give that to Rusk.

Do you mind removing... Thank you. Here you go, Rusk.

Don't worry, you'll get it next turn. And then I'll give myself something so I don't die. That's the end of my turn.

[Rusk]
Alright, it's time to murder things. Stride. And then...

Enter ever-stand... Oh, now it works. Okay.

And then... I miss. That's unfortunate.

Alright.

[James]
Hey, it's Blue-Ringed Octopus. Now I don't have to spend any actions on moving. I do have to spend actions on missing.

[Rusk]
Nice.

[James]
No fucking way! This never happens.

[Rusk]
Is that going to take me down to exactly one hit point? It is.

[James]
What? Wait, what are you talking about?

[Rusk]
That's the damage roll, right?

[Mantra]
22? No, I just grabbed you.

[Rusk]
Well, I think I may...

[Kuji]
Did he take damage from that hit?

[James]
No, I don't think so. It just rolled for... I don't think it does...

No, it doesn't do damage. It just grabs you. There's a rotation for what it's supposed to do.

So right now you're just grabbed and off-guard. Which is very good for me.

[Kuji]
Well, that doesn't sound good.

[James]
Okay. Give me a moment to assign targets, which are all of you. Unless Minaya is flying.

[Manaia]
Minaya? As much as I would like to lie, Minaya cannot fly continuously.

[Speaker 6]
Alas.

[Manaia]
That's one of the biggest problems she has. Alright, folks. Begin your fort saves.

[Kuji]
Why did I move so far away?

[Rusk]
What? Why is... It's the wrong character.

[Kuji]
Would we be out of emanation because of the door or the wall?

[Rusk]
No.

[James]
Terrible. Rusk, you need to click on the thing. Just click on the thing.

[Kuji]
He wrote his own. These fellas know rules.

[Manaia]
There you go.

[Mantra]
Oh, Minaya saves you. That's funny.

[Manaia]
Listen, she may be having a terrible day, but she got this one.

[James]
Aw, no critical failures. That sucks. I'm going to push 10 feet away.

I'm going to push 10 feet away. I'm still grappling you, though. Get over here.

[Kuji]
Are the Nyxies flying? Do they get affected? Nope.

[James]
Bijuu and Kaiju. Kuji and Kaiju.

[Manaia]
Please heal me. Please.

[James]
Go. And then there is another blue-ringed octopus. I know.

Let's use... ...this to speed on over.

[Kuji]
Are we in water? Yeah. I don't know how you missed that earlier.

Oh, I missed. Should we be taking swimming penalties? Are we in deep water, fully swimming?

[James]
I was telling you guys about waist high earlier. I don't know if... It's not so deep that you can't reach the ground.

I mean, maybe Minae. I'm not sure.

[Kuji]
I'm going to... ...walk up to here. And I'm going to target Minae.

I'm going to do a little battle medicine. Oh, no. Whoops.

Whoops. I changed my initiative. I'd like to...

Here, I put that. 20 to success.

[James]
Wait, what the... Wait, what just happened?

[Kuji]
I am... What happened to your initiative? ...healing. I pressed a random button and it moved me.

[Speaker 6]
What are you talking... What the f...

[James]
Alright. We're going back down there. Anyways.

[Kuji]
I thought I was pressing the wrong button, but it got set as... ...Kuji's initiative. For some reason.

And... Is it a macro that you're pressing? Like, what are you...

I'm pressing the treat wounds button.

[James]
Well, why did it change your initiative? I guess... It was, uh...

Was it a success, or... Or, you hero-pointed it.

[Kuji]
Yeah. Rolled a 20, yeah, with a hero-point. But it didn't roll as a success.

For some reason.

[James]
No, it did.

[Kuji]
It just scrolled up a little bit. Yeah, but, like, it's not rolling the heal option.

[James]
You can just roll the... Because you clicked a button that said set as Kuji's initiative.

[Kuji]
Yeah.

[Manaia]
Okay, how much healing is it supposed to do? What's the dice roll for it?

[Kuji]
I don't know. 2. 2d8.

[Manaia]
Better than nothing.

[Kuji]
You heal for 2.

[Manaia]
Thank you.

[Kuji]
Incredible. 2 actions, and I'm gonna give Kaiju... ...my 2 actions to do a bitey-bite. For some squid. Ugh! Nothing!

[James]
Maybe there's an Exe over here. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. It'd be pretty cool if I went over here.

Wait, no. I'm not doing any damage. No, no, I am doing damage.

That's fine. Nice. Love that off-guard.

Not very impressive damage.

[Rusk]
Am I allowed to use reactions? When I'm...

[James]
...all grabbed? I believe so. Yeah.

Oh, well... Provide you do it in the next 5 minutes. There you go.

Alright, so that would undo that damage. And I'm gonna take the sub-machine off. Cool.

[Rusk]
Negated.

[James]
And then, I'm gonna do this for the sweep. Ugh! That's awful.

Let's see. I think she's going to... Uh, can you make me a...

What is it? Defense will? Can you make me a will save?

[Speaker 6]
Who?

[James]
Uh, Mantra. There we go.

[Rusk]
There. We... Had a success.

[Mantra]
So I'm stunned one for one round. Okay.

[James]
Mm-hmm. I don't even know what that does.

[Mantra]
It's the first time I've used it. I will lose one round.

[James]
It's the first time I've used it. Yeah, this wasn't what I tried. Move over.

You know what? Yeah. Move over.

And attack.

[Manaia]
Oh. Can't get anything.

[James]
That is a hit. And I will take that one. Damage is damage.

Alright, Mantra. Uh, can I take the 1d12? That would immediately get rid of stunned.

[Mantra]
So I'm going to be at 11, and I'm going to delay after Manaia for the Scout the Heart.

[James]
Okay. Cool. Shouldn't you still be half stunned, or what does that last until?

[Mantra]
I took the damage already. The damage from what? Uh, the wand.

It does extra 1d12 damage, because I was stunned when I started my turn.

[James]
Okay, I didn't see the damage for the thing. Alright, sweet. I was like, because it disappeared like right away, I was like, what the fuck, where'd it go?

[Mantra]
Yeah. Alright, thank you.

[Speaker 6]
You're most welcome.

[Mantra]
They are going to stride around to here, and they are going to Flurry of Flows, and that will be the end of their turn after.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Mantra]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Pain, death even.

[James]
Is that the same one? Oh yeah, that one's dead. Rough.

[Rusk]
Was this right by me?

[James]
Two Nixes have died, so... I mean, everybody... Maybe...

Oh, I should have written this down.

[Kuji]
There we go.

[Rusk]
Did that do it?

[James]
Dude, okay. Remind me to move the dead bodies as well. Go ahead and make your saves.

[Mantra]
I'm going to use Halfling Luck to reroll the crit now. Alrighty.

[Speaker 6]
Nice.

[Mantra]
That's better.

[James]
Alright, I'm rolling for Kaiju and Kiju. Let's see if it gets moved. Just Kuji and Manaia.

Rusk!

[Rusk]
Yes, alright. Alright. What is this creature by me?

[James]
You are currently being grappled by an octopus.

[Rusk]
Oh, I should probably smack that thing. That's not really nice.

[Mantra]
We should be flanking the octopus, right? Even though it's kind of in the bottom of the square.

[James]
Uh, hold on.

[Rusk]
Critical, ooh. Okay.

[Mantra]
Oh, probably he's not going to help that one. What did you do? Oh, you rolled a one.

Mr. James, I don't know if you noticed, but the text box you have, it's going through the wall, so I can't read all of it.

[Rusk]
Okay, I'm just going to raise my shield. That's my turn. I missed twice.

This fucker won't let me go.

[James]
See, I can't tell because if I click on somebody's thing, normally the text boxes aren't affected by the walls. Or if I use somebody's vision, I can't notice if they're... Now Russ, you raised your shield, you tried to hit, oh, you tried to hit twice.

[Rusk]
Yeah, uh, it did not end well.

[James]
Unfortunate.

[Rusk]
At least I raised my shield.

[James]
Ugh. Yes!

[Rusk]
Fuck!

[James]
Make me that foot save.

[Rusk]
This is not kosher.

[Mantra]
I'm not making a video right now.

[Rusk]
Okay, that's pre-based.

[Mantra]
What were you saying, Lemon? I'm not on my computer right now, I don't know what's happening.

[Manaia]
Oh, uh, octopus bitch. Uh, Rusk.

[Rusk]
Hey James, can I shield block this? I have, my shield has seven hardness.

[Mantra]
I think that you can. If you do damage over the hardness, your shield's durability takes a hit.

[James]
Hold on, what? Don't, don't, don't do that one. You would be able to shield block.

[Rusk]
Alright, I will use my shield block. My shield has a hardness of seven. How do I trigger this on myself?

[James]
Oh man, that actually, that actually succeeded. That would have been fucking miserable for you.

[Rusk]
I'm trying to figure out how to actually trigger this.

[James]
Uh, just undo the, uh, you would just undo the damage. What's your thing's durability?

[Rusk]
Uh, twenty, the broken threshold is ten and the shield hardness is seven.

[James]
Shield take enemy damage. Up to the shields prevents you from taking them out. Okay.

[Rusk]
And then a excess would damage the shield and hurt me as well.

[James]
Alright, well I didn't apply the damage so you are good to go.

[Rusk]
Perfect.

[James]
Oh, I can treat poison as my final action since I'm unlikely to...

[Rusk]
That two extra hardness was actually quite nice.

[James]
Oh no, it doesn't work.

[Rusk]
Your plans have been foiled, James.

[James]
Oh, then I totally forgot to drag the Nixie's... Alright, so the Nixie bodies are like down here. They're like washing up against your legs.

[Rusk]
Ugh, freaky.

[James]
In the Keystone... One more time... Everybody roll, unless you're not right next to your computer, in which case I'll roll for it.

I'm back. Very hee hee. Yes hee hee.

Yes, thank you. That's kaiju, that's... Next.

Keystone is fully charged.

[Rusk]
I forgot what failing this fortitude save does.

[Kuji]
These are octopuses, right? Oh.

[James]
Emerging from the Keystone. He's a healthy-looking... Nixie.

Along with its mount. We'll move on to another blue-ringed octopus. Which I think is also going to attack Rusk.

[Rusk]
Yes! It misses.

[James]
It does miss. Shouldn't it mark you as off-guard?

[Rusk]
Oh, so that plus two is because I have my shield raised?

[James]
Right, it just doesn't show, like... I would expect it to say, like, plus two or minus. Well, there's no...

Well, if you have a plus two and a minus two, I guess it doesn't show.

[Rusk]
Yeah.

[James]
Then there's no real penalty to show, so it's not going to show anything different.

[Rusk]
Yeah, back when I did have a penalty, it did show.

[James]
Let's do it again! Oh!

[Rusk]
Quit trying to hit me, you're denting my armor. This is important to me. What?

I'm scratching the paper.

[James]
Okay, it doesn't speak a language. You can't do... Alright, that's...

Sorry, I'm looking at the basic action. It says, demoralize. You are the best in your party.

The octopus cannot... That doesn't work. I'm sorry.

Demoralizes you into tentacles. I can't distract you with a gesture, I think. Or I can try.

Oh no, that's you rolling. I'm sorry, I had you clicked.

[Manaia]
Distracting yourself, eh?

[Rusk]
I'm the best distraction, who knew?

[Speaker 6]
Look over there!

[James]
Not so bad as a failure goes. It could have been worse. Fuji!

[Kuji]
Fuji's gonna do a little zappy zappy. As I cast electric arc. I thought I had both of them selected.

I did have both of them selected.

[James]
Very nice. Thank you.

[Kuji]
Oh, that makes me sad. So, no damage with the crit, half damage with the other.

[James]
I think you just took cover behind Rust's shield. What?

[Kuji]
Yep, and then give an action to... Kaiju. He's gonna run up here for the flanking.

And, which one's grabbing him, or are they both grabbing him?

[James]
What's his move, by the way?

[Kuji]
50.

[James]
Oh, he's got plenty, fuck me.

[Kuji]
Yeah.

[James]
I think it's... I think it's the one on the right that's grappling him.

[Kuji]
Yeah, and then he's gonna do a little bitey bite. Missing! Hello.

[James]
Lady Togr is going to move. Order the mount to move this way. Do a little tail action.

Excellent, looking good. And then, do I want to... Do I want to start with attacks, or do I want to...

No, this seems like a good option. Mantra. Indulge me with a fortitude save.

Oh, by the way, we've been playing more than an hour. Everybody go ahead and add a hero point to your characters.

[Kuji]
Fortitude save me.

[Rusk]
Hero points.

[Kuji]
That would be the time. So next to your character name and your shape, there should be a little hero point icon. Three dots.

I see it. There we go.

[Rusk]
So what do you use them for?

[James]
Mantra, click the little fortitude save me thing if you would like to use... So, it's EC24, so you can choose whether or not to reroll, but that would be a critical fail.

[Mantra]
Oh, that's fine, I'll just take it. Are you sure? Yep.

Okay. Okay. What is...

Do more...

[James]
Okay. Well, it doesn't say a basic save. It just says that you take damage.

[Mantra]
Is that a premaster?

[James]
Good question. I'm going to double check that. Well, first I'm going to roll this damage, and then I'm going to double check that.

It is premaster. It is legacy content.

[Mantra]
That is why, because basic save did not exist before the remaster.

[James]
Okay. Oh, there is details for what happens if critical... So, crit failure would be the target takes double damage and is pushed 20 feet.

Yep. Are you sure you do not want to reroll? Yep.

Really? It's going to kill you. Okay.

[Manaia]
You... You are oddly fine with this. Okay.

[Mantra]
I'm going to use my cure point to move from dying 4 to dying 0 and unconscious. It immediately kills you. It doesn't...

Yeah, yeah. Oh, I see. Okay, I'll die then.

What is...

[Kuji]
That's why he's asking, like, do you want to stop it because that will not rightfully work.

[Rusk]
I've never seen James so bewildered in my life.

[James]
I respect it. I totally respect it. I...

He's the second body of this dungeon is claimed.

[Manaia]
Okey-dokey.

[James]
Well, that is its turn.

[Manaia]
Hands up if you want to run.

[Kuji]
I don't want to rest my hand.

[Manaia]
Yeah. Okay. We can snatch Mantra's body and skedaddle out of here.

[Mantra]
Oh, yeah, take the body.

[James]
You want my way, you have to go get it.

[Mantra]
Hold up. Hold up.

[James]
Nope, hold on. That's not supposed to... What the fuck?

[Rusk]
How many are alive? One, two, three.

[Manaia]
Oh, three of them.

[James]
There's, like, four things alive. Oh, sorry. I mean, that's not...

That's not supposed to be a critical hit, I don't think. So, what's her strike? Her strike is plus nine.

This one's plus seven. This is just... It's not a critical hit.

This is regular damage. Oh. Okay.

This is still rolling off the verge.

[Rusk]
I say we fight this.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Shit. Okay.

[Rusk]
Besides, the no-retreat doctrine is still in effect.

[Manaia]
Oh my god, right, you can't leave.

[James]
Kaiju takes no damage, what the hell?

[Manaia]
Oh, wow, hey, congrats.

[Rusk]
And I still have a spell that I can cast.

[Kuji]
You better be casting a spell soon, then.

[Rusk]
Manaia!

[Manaia]
It's my turn. Okay.

[Rusk]
Be a vengeful one, comrade.

[Manaia]
Yes, yes, give me a second. Use... We're doing the, uh...

30-foot emanation. Don't place emanation. Ah!

Kaiju, do you mind moving? No, you can't move. Aye.

Okay, um... Hm. If I delay myself, the horse goes next.

Okay, well... We cannot cast them harm. But I do suppose I can...

Okay, look. Bin. If I...

Gimme. Sorry, my screen just dragged itself away. Ignore that.

If... Is there any way I... Ah!

Ah! If I put it... Here?

Nope, that still hits kaiju. Kaiju, you are very...

[Kuji]
No matter where you do emanation, it's from yourself. So you basically hit everyone in the room. So if you're gonna do...

Without hitting everyone, you'll need to do it to action.

[Manaia]
Okay. Yeah, okay, I'll just hit lady Treg'or, then. I was planning on hitting all three of these nerds, but...

Oh, the horse is still banged up, though. Yeah, the horse is still banged up, it didn't keep the damage. Fascinating.

Okay, um... Let's hit lady Treg'or first, because she's the biggest... Sorry, I've got a question.

Just really quick. Was it the horse that emitted the damage, or was it lady Treg'or who shot the... Force ray thing?

[James]
So, lady Treg'or shot it, but it's attached to the... It's a saddle. Okay.

Don't hit the canvas.

[Manaia]
Okay. Thank you. That's what I wanted to know.

Alright, I'll just kill her since she's in control of it for now. Oopsie-daisy. We're doing two action harms, so just imagine that was not there.

Seven! To lady Treg'or.

[James]
And she has to make a force ray, right?

[Manaia]
Right. Yeah. Absolutely...

Yeah.

[James]
Fails.

[Manaia]
Joyous day! Cool. And then I'm going to activate this cool knife I found.

Called the spark blade.

[James]
You want a cold iron sword?

[Manaia]
Please do. I am very stupid. Please ignore me.

I forgot I had that in my inventory.

[James]
It happens.

[Manaia]
Okay, please feel free to take it from me, because I can't attack. So, Russ... Anyway, this is towards her and her horse.

Basic reflex save.

[James]
From your chosen creature... Hey! Pretty cool.

Oh, nice.

[Manaia]
The horse lives, but she doesn't. Good enough, good enough.

[James]
Horse is sitting pretty. Alright, nicely done.

[Manaia]
That's fine. Can I use my familiar to give the knife to Russ?

[Kuji]
Yeah.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
You'd need to use an axe, unless it has independent, though, wouldn't you?

[Manaia]
It has independent, that's why I asked. Russ, here is a cold iron knife, please use it to stab.

[James]
Russ is busy getting a...

[Rusk]
I'm kind of, you know, tangled up at the moment, but yeah.

[James]
Russ is involved in a reverse sushi restaurant situation.

[Rusk]
Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I'm going to make the best with my turn what I have.

[Manaia]
Okay, once you have a free thing, stab with the spark blade. And that's my turn.

[Rusk]
But Mantra is dead. I think they have more than dine, too.

[James]
Well... And then, Russ!

[Rusk]
Alright. I need to make sure I'm able to cast spells. Am I able to cast this?

I hope so.

[James]
Hey, that's pretty handy!

[Rusk]
Yeah, because we're all grouped up. Alright, so we're going to do that. That raises my shield automatically, and then I'm going to try and...

[James]
That's going to kill the user. Fucking octopi.

[Rusk]
I'm going to bash this one, I'm going to bash it, and hopefully that does something.

[Manaia]
Is it dead? No.

[Kuji]
No, no, the thing behind it makes you dead.

[Manaia]
Ah, I see. The skull was distracting me.

[James]
Is Kaiju dead or just unconscious? Neither. If I hover over him, it says unconscious.

[Rusk]
And then I'm going to make another attack. And it hits again! Nice!

That's my turn.

[James]
It'll die on its next thingy. Now, the Cold Iron... You have not been here for a while, so Cold Iron weapons are something which...

A lot of critters, unlike in 5e, a lot of critters, especially extra-dimensional ones, in Pathfinder 2nd Edition have weaknesses. So they take extra damage if they take it from certain kinds of sources, or certain damage types, or types of weapons, like made out of special materials.

[Rusk]
Okay.

[James]
You guys would know at this point, or your party would know, or you had literally just been told by Mediah, that Cold Iron weapon deals extra damage to V-Fay.

[Rusk]
We'll keep that in mind.

[James]
In the meantime, I have a date with your shield.

[Rusk]
It's not me, it's you.

[James]
I missed. Go ahead and damage me. Oh, by the way, right-click...

If you right-click that message, you can click Pop-Out Message. The one for Shields of the Spirit.

[Rusk]
Oh. Pop-Out Message. Okay.

[James]
That's helpful.

[Rusk]
Oh.

[James]
Uh-oh. Undo.

[Rusk]
I did not want to take 6 damage. No thank you.

[James]
Wait, so I...

[Rusk]
Wow, this spell is garbage. This spell is awful.

[James]
This is the worst. This spell sucks.

[Manaia]
Okay, I'm sorry. It just starts biting you in the end.

[Rusk]
This spell gives you plus 1 AC, but did you know that... if an enemy tries to attack you, you get hurt anyways?

[James]
That should have been even lower. Alright, go ahead and click the button again. It missed.

[Rusk]
Alright. That's actually very helpful that I can pop this out.

[James]
And then get ready to do it again.

[Rusk]
Yes!

[Speaker 6]
Alright!

[Rusk]
This is great. I love this. This feels amazing.

[James]
It is not the Hippocampus' turn, because... It is being ridden. It is the Nixie Keystone.

We're going to move you along a different floor. Technically, you still got to... You still get to save.

Yeah, no, it looks like the Raptor is unconscious to me.

[Kuji]
Yeah, I think it is, yeah.

[James]
I'm going to make your saves. I'm going to make them for you. They're in the chat.

[Mantra]
Click the button.

[James]
There we go. This dead body, uh... flops against...

flops against the wall, I guess. I don't know. Then we have the other Blue-Ringed Octopus, which is going to die, I think.

I'm pretty sure this is going to kill it. Alright, go ahead and kill it.

[Rusk]
Boom. So it tries to smack me, and then it just vaporizes.

[James]
Yeah. Bring us the Coogee!

[Rusk]
Am I still armed?

[James]
You are no longer grabbed.

[Rusk]
Yes! Give me my... Yes!

[James]
20 AC.

[Kuji]
I'm going to give two actions to Coogee. One to stand up. Everything nearby is dead.

I guess it's going to go there. And that is my turn.

[James]
Saving my turn.

[Manaia]
You know, I'm more glad we did not go down the elevator, because this is the second floor.

[Kuji]
I don't know if we went down there and finished it off, so it would have come back.

[Manaia]
Yes, but it would have been...

[Kuji]
That's true, if you went down and finished it off, you would have taken it.

[Speaker 6]
True, true.

[Kuji]
I feel sad that... that level 11 item is used... in this fight.

[Manaia]
Listen, if we can kill these guys...

[Kuji]
Level 11 item?

[Manaia]
I'm genuinely surprised...

[Kuji]
Yeah, the item she had was like level 11. No.

[Manaia]
I'm surprised this Nixie didn't run off after seeing one of her friends exorcised, alas.

[Kuji]
It was crazy strong.

[Manaia]
I should have saved that doorknob if I knew she was going to come back.

[Kuji]
Ah, once a day. Is it once a day or just one off?

[Manaia]
It's once a day, so... If we come back... It costs, like, all of my gold.

What? Ah, it's here. Hello.

Hi.

[Kuji]
I was able to get past my raptor. Oh, see? Oh, I have to...

Wait, you had 900 gold?

[Manaia]
Yes. Oh, shit. I saved up.

I sold literally, like, all of the things, even though it was half the price. And I did not buy any runes for my armor, which I'm regretting now, because I think I could have used the extra AC.

[Rusk]
Hey, James.

[James]
What's up?

[Rusk]
So, I just was reading the Shield of Spirit spell. I don't get the effects of it. So, these octopuses should be still alive.

[James]
No, I'm not reverting it. What would the, uh...

[Rusk]
No, for next time. We'll know for next time.

[James]
Thank you for finding that, though. Can I command an animal multiple times? That doesn't sound right.

[Kuji]
No, you can only use one action to command it to give it two actions. You can give your action to give it actions, though.

[Mantra]
So, if you have two actions, you can command it to give it three actions if you have the Mature Animal Companion feat.

[James]
Alas, I do not. Thank you, the Horned Hambret. Hey, buddy!

Rusk! Oh, buddy!

[Rusk]
Yeah, what's up? Come get me, then. This is gonna be great.

[James]
Oh, hey. You live! You take half damage and you push...

Wait, no. No, you take full damage and you push ten feet.

[Rusk]
I take full damage. I'm going to use this to just deal with a little bit. Actually, never mind.

I'll take the full damage.

[James]
Man, feel free to, like, use your stuff. I don't want to screw you over here.

[Rusk]
I'm saving my... I'm saving my reaction for Orc Ferocity in case I absolutely need to use it. Because, well, if you make another attack and it actually will kill me.

[Manaia]
You can see who's... Remember, you do have the cool knife I gave you. The spark blade knife to stab the Nixies with.

[James]
That does seem rather important.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[James]
Oh, wait. No, you know what? Before moving...

Which one has the... Okay. Oh, I'm not taking that one.

I already know it's good. Can I do Control-Z? No, it doesn't let me do that anymore!

What the hell, man? I'm going to go over and I'm going to Yoink. Basically, it's Interact.

[Manaia]
Gosh dang it. She took the good axe.

[James]
Now I'm going to equip it.

[Manaia]
One last move to take. Okay, so we have to kill her now. Like, more so.

It's my turn! Okay. It's a long shot.

But if we can get her to stop fighting us... There! And it should hit both the Nixie and the thing and the thing.

[Rusk]
Incapacitation.

[Manaia]
So both Nixies. And the horse.

[James]
It's of equal level. Well, the one Nixie is one level lower and the other two are of equal level.

[Manaia]
So, does it affect them or does it not affect them?

[James]
Oh, shit.

[Manaia]
Okay! So only lady... Okay!

[Kuji]
Okay, that's awesome! Because it has Incapacitation effect, it automatically gets a higher save.

[Manaia]
If they're higher level.

[James]
So they're level 2, the spell is level 2.

[Manaia]
So everything's good.

[James]
I'm going to go read the Incapacitation because this is a good time for me to learn. And internalize.

[Manaia]
Okay, so while we're doing this... Hey guys!

[James]
Okay, it's the same benefits. Okay, so this is not... So if this was level 4, it would treat that success as a critical success.

And the other two would, for instance, treat the critical failure as a regular failure. However... Hey guys!

Yeah, so the Hippocampus and the Nixie can no longer take hostile actions. Except for the one that's like... And attacking them does not stop the effect.

[Manaia]
This is great news! Alright guys! Now focus on...

This is great news! For me! For us, less so for them.

[James]
If you guys knock out or kill Lady Togr, then it will...

[Manaia]
We're good.

[James]
Then you're good to go, yeah.

[Manaia]
So guys...

[James]
Oh sorry, did you have an action left?

[Manaia]
Uh... It was one comm... Yeah, I did have one action left.

And that action is... I'm going to Rousing Splash... Cast...

Hey, do you... Yeah, you probably need it more than I do. Here you go.

[James]
Rousing Splash is two actions! You cannot perform it!

[Manaia]
It's two?! Ignore me. Nothing happened.

Nothing... None of that happened.

[Rusk]
I would have to delete those temporary hit points.

[Manaia]
Just the four. You have to delete your character to get it out of here. I'll just recast Stoke the Heart.

Hey! And I'll give you... The...

These ones. And once again give you the whole thingamabob. Okay!

[Rusk]
See, now that's a nice buffer right there.

[Manaia]
Oh wait! Hold on, hold on. If I use Cackle, that will automatically do it for me.

So I don't have to waste my action. And then I can attempt to just throw something at this lady. Nah, I cannot throw something at this lady.

I'm going to... Yeah, you can keep that. Cackle shall not happen.

Ignore me, nothing is happening.

[James]
Just tell me what you want to have happen. Or try to do.

[Manaia]
Oh, I'm saying I couldn't... I couldn't have done anything else. So all is well.

Alright. Rusk!

[Rusk]
Alright! Stride. The strongest action.

[James]
Move the thing over.

[Rusk]
I actually can't get in range to attack and draw the spark blade and attack. So... I think right now...

[James]
You didn't draw it last turn? Well no, no, you were handed it. By the familiar.

[Manaia]
Yeah, it was put in your hand.

[Rusk]
But wasn't I, like, grappled? You can...

[James]
That doesn't mean shit, there was a fucking octopus there.

[Rusk]
Oh, so I have it drawn for free.

[James]
Yes. Well, the cost was something else's action, but... You don't have to worry about it.

[Rusk]
Well, in that case, I will smack... I'm guessing I have to target the mount. That would make sense.

No, target the lady.

[Manaia]
Yeah, target her.

[Rusk]
Alright! I'm gonna smack the fuck out of you. Oh, that's um...

[Manaia]
Use your hero point.

[Rusk]
Yes.

[James]
I mean, you don't have to. Might need some other time.

[Rusk]
Uh... How do I use it?

[James]
Right click it, and then click, uh... Right click the message of your attack. And click re-roll using a hero point.

[Manaia]
Right click, re-roll... Using hero point.

[Rusk]
Huzzah!

[Manaia]
And it's cold iron!

[Rusk]
Oh, and I have to remove the ever-stand stance on me? Because I'm no longer dual-wielding... Two-handing a shield.

[James]
Okay.

[Rusk]
Uh, that should be my turn.

[James]
Well, you did stride, and then...

[Rusk]
I did stride for an extra 5 feet, so yeah.

[Kuji]
Really?

[Rusk]
Yeah, I'm a dwarf. Got that lovely 20... Movement.

Oh... Ah.

[James]
Yeah, 20 feet. Who would've thought? It's always surprising to me how much movement...

Matters. So... Let's try...

[Rusk]
I mean, this character's gonna be a juggernaut if he lives long enough.

[James]
If he lives, yeah. I'm gonna try to fix that in a moment, but...

[Rusk]
Okay. I'm counting on you.

[James]
Oh, hey, that secret door's still there. That's cool. Except it's no longer secret.

[Manaia]
The less-than-secret door.

[James]
Less-than-secret.

[Manaia]
Like the Fortitude.

[James]
The open-secret door. Haha! Alright, Fortitude time.

Oh! Is it twice? I already hit you guys with it?

No, no, it's not twice. I don't know how that happened. Alright, rolling for Kaiju.

Hey! That gets pushed back a lot. Uh...

[Manaia]
It's okay.

[James]
It's not here, so... Gets pushed... Well, Coogee's already against the wall, so it's fine.

[Rusk]
That's okay, let me tank him.

[James]
Coogee! Bear! Buddy!

Rosif! Bear-hee-hee!

[Kuji]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[James]
There it is!

[Kuji]
I'm just trying to... I was... Can you see my little mouth?

See the thingy-movie? I...

[James]
No, I didn't see it.

[Kuji]
Do I want it?

[James]
No, I didn't see it. I have this giant fucking, like, stat block just covering half the screen. I think Keg's about that.

[Kuji]
Alrighty. Um... Do I want to do Heelys?

Or do I want to do... Hurties?

[Manaia]
Attack the lady. She's almost there.

[Kuji]
Yeah, I guess I'll... I'll go up here. So I'll use two actions to stride.

And then I'll do a... I'll do a little nom.

[Speaker 6]
Ugh!

[Speaker 7]
You wanna... Hear a point of that? Nice!

Sticks damage. Nice! Not nice enough.

Nice enough!

[Manaia]
A query? Can... Temporary hit points bring someone back up?

Or is it only normal hit points?

[Kuji]
Normal hit points.

[Manaia]
Okay, thank you.

[James]
So it was a stride, and then a stride attack, then recovery?

[Kuji]
She's striding a bite.

[James]
Ah, I gotcha.

[Kuji]
No.

[James]
She's not looking so hot. But she is alive! I'll keep my multi-attack down.

[Rusk]
Hits.

[James]
Just barely. Jeez. Yeah, yeah.

[Rusk]
Okay. Nine damage. That would actually put me down.

[James]
But... Would you like to enjoy your first session back by destroying another shield?

[Kuji]
It would be fine.

[Rusk]
He didn't raise his shield, he can't. Objectively speaking, it would be fine. No, I have this.

This doesn't require me to have my shield raised.

[Manaia]
Ha ha ha ha ha! Is that the reaction you were saving?

[Rusk]
No, orc ferocity is the one I was saving, but... This one will keep me from actually getting to that state.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[James]
Go ahead and apply... There you go.

[Rusk]
Don't worry guys, we're doing fine. This is fine.

[James]
What are the penalties for doing a ranged attack in melee?

[Mantra]
Nothing.

[Manaia]
It depends on the item.

[Kuji]
If you have the attack of opportunity, you get an attack of opportunity, I believe. But without that...

[James]
I think this is going to be worth it for... Yes, it is! He's not going to die right away.

He's going to take damage though.

[Rusk]
Yeah, I can't use orc ferocity because... I already used my reaction.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no!

[Rusk]
So I get pushed how many feet? Only 10. Damn, I don't get slammed into the wall.

Alright.

[James]
They just take 5 damage and... Wait, no, no. Oh, it's based on my success, so...

You get moved back 5 and you take some damage. That's... That's her turn.

Alright, we still have this Nixie. Sweet. Oh, we're...

Where's the ratman? Where's the ratman going? You know what?

It's not important. We have...

[Manaia]
She can't do anything to me. That's right! She's calm!

She can't do shit!

[James]
She's just lightly... She moves over to Rusk and just starts lightly caressing him. She's...

She's actually... She's keeping Rusk's head above water. Wait, she can do...

And she'll cast... Oh, you can't... You can't speak while you're unconscious, can you?

No.

[Manaia]
Oh, that's hard. Dreadfully sorry, my computer died. What did I miss?

[James]
The Nixie asks, Does anybody want me to help him up?

[Kuji]
Does he initially move in front of the creature? Or is that up and ready?

[Manaia]
I mean, hey, if the Nixie is willing to help make sure that Rusk doesn't die, sure. As long as you guys don't kill me.

[James]
This is a binding fate, then. Manaia, go ahead and cast something on him. Cast something healing for the man.

[Manaia]
Without expecting to... Okay! I am...

I'm going to be so honest with you. Keeping... Just...

In general... What... Grant Desire, any first...

Oh! Any first level spell. Okay, can she cast Heal?

[James]
Sure. Does anybody have Heal on hand?

[Manaia]
I do! Do I need the spell slot?

[James]
No, no. Oh, I'm going to... I'm going to click this for...

[Manaia]
Dead.

[James]
Rusk, be healed, child.

[Rusk]
I rise again.

[James]
You were in this, Nixie's dead. Alright. Manaia!

It's my turn!

[Manaia]
Oh, I am so thankful she was nice enough to do that.

[James]
Oh, you bet! She doesn't have many other choices. It's the best option for staying alive.

That's true!

[Kuji]
Is it a one-action heal or a three-action heal? It's a one-action.

[Manaia]
Uh-oh. No. Alright.

Attack. Please hit. We're re-rolling that!

Yay! Damage. And we're using...

Cold Iron. And we're using Cold Iron darts. Yeah, she's dead!

I just point at her and do like... Well, no, I can't. I don't have fingers.

I just... I just want to... Is it like coming out of the wings later?

Yeah. You know how people open their cloak and knives fly out? It's that, but needles.

And my wings. Rather than a cloak. Fuck yeah, that looks awesome.

[Mantra]
Yeah. Exactly. The bird bash.

[Manaia]
The bird bash! Okay. Okay.

Immediately loot her pocket.

[James]
Alright, well that's the end of the encounter. I suppose the... Hank.

Oh!

[Manaia]
Well, not quite.

[James]
See, you guys... There's one last thing.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm?

[James]
Which is... I'm gonna move the hippo... The hippocampus over here.

Nice. There's the... The Nixie Keystone is very important.

Because right now it's been flooding the other room. And you guys can either abandon it... You guys can either abandon the dwarves inside there, or you can try to deactivate the keystone.

[Manaia]
Yeah, we can try to deactivate it. I'll just... My familiar can do the looting.

Can I set my familiar to do that?

[James]
You... First one up before this, then, will be Kuji.

[Manaia]
Okay, thank you.

[James]
You guys have... Oh!

[Kuji]
Okay. Kuji is... An elimination.

I'm gonna cast 3 heal.

[Manaia]
Disable the keystone first.

[Kuji]
I can't.

[James]
It's up to him. You can't?

[Kuji]
No.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
So everyone gets 8 healing.

[Manaia]
Thank you. So appreciated. My ribs feel much better.

Rusk.

[Rusk]
Alright. Stride? Do I have to spend an action to get up?

You do. Okay, so I rise to my feet. I stride.

Is this, like, horse thing gonna try killing us?

[James]
No, it's calmed. It can't even attack. So it's a non-combatant at this point.

It can't even attack you, even if you attack it. It so horribly failed the calm spell. That was pretty clutch.

[Manaia]
Alright, so... Oh my god.

[Rusk]
Lucky as fuck. And I don't need to kill it, because it's technically counted as a surrendered foe. Yeah, no, it's given up.

[James]
You guys get XP for everything, whether it lives. You can hop on it right now, you still get XP for it.

[Rusk]
Alright, and Rusk is going to hop on top of it, and raise his sword in the air, and do a victory scream. Because that's the best way to spend your turn.

[James]
Give me, like, an animal... What skill would that even be? Nature?

Sure, sure. It could be nature. I don't think there's any...

I can't think of any wars that would apply to it. I'm sure they're out there. You had to make me a nature check, Mr. Rusk.

[Rusk]
I'm untrained in this. I roll a big old three.

[James]
Alright, well I'm not super happy about that, but we'll get to that later. Minaya!

[Manaia]
I'm going to take the keystone. I tried to disable it. What do I roll for this?

Occult? Occultism? Arcana?

[James]
Occultism would work.

[Manaia]
Okay, would Arcana work as well?

[James]
It would.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[James]
Hey, we're good. Does that... Okay, so...

There's two actions, so you do two actions, you succeed once. Okay, I have to roll again? Disabling the monolith...

No. So, disabling the monolith requires three successful checks. It's just that to do a check, it requires two actions.

Like, rolling two disable is a two-action check.

[Manaia]
Okay. Well, that's, I guess, the end of Minaya's turn. Can my creature start taking things from dead people's pockets?

It can. Don't worry, you'll get the loot. Kuji!

Thank you.

[Kuji]
Is water flowing through this door? In, like, in or out? Like, through the cracks.

Yes. Because there's dwarves in here. Like, if I open up the door, would the water levels be roughly the same, or would it...

[James]
Not based on the... Do you understand dwarves?

[Kuji]
Would it start to flow through?

[James]
No. I do.

[Kuji]
No, I didn't understand dwarves.

[James]
There's water coming from... It's coming from higher than in this room.

[Kuji]
It's coming from that room into this room from a higher level?

[James]
It's coming... The water level in the other room is higher.

[Kuji]
Okay. Um... So you said that's a cult to check that, to try to disable it, is it?

[James]
It could be a cult, religion, arcana, or thievery.

[Kuji]
Cult, arcana... I'm gonna go try to save the dwarves. Huh.

It's locked. The... Keystone.

Keystone. I can't do the keystone.

[Speaker 7]
Why?

[Kuji]
Fine. I'll go up there and I'll try to do it.

[James]
If you face any negative... See, if you face any negative consequences for this, you, uh... Which you just did.

You should yell at Minaya.

[Manaia]
That's fine.

[James]
Yep, Minaya.

[Manaia]
You can throw a rock at me if you can.

[James]
No. Why would you do this? Ah!

My bad, I fell off. What the hell's the matter with you? Why did you set him on fire?

[Manaia]
That was my bad.

[James]
Why would you do that to him?

[Manaia]
I did not think it would be that. It wasn't me, it was the keystone.

[James]
It was... You bullied him into it. I didn't tell him to put his...

I didn't bully him into it.

[Manaia]
I didn't bully him into it.

[James]
Yes, I did. You double-ball-dared him to stick his tongue out. I did, I did.

No, no. Drinkers, you people. Come get burnt.

Alright, Rusk.

[Rusk]
So, it's not really happy. Um... Sorry?

I'm gonna try...

[James]
You have two rounds to prevent the dwarves in the next round from dying.

[Rusk]
Okay, I'm going... I'm going to jump off this thing. And the dwarves are in this room, right?

Mm-hmm, to the left. Okay. Stride.

I want to check the door. Is it able to be opened, or is it locked?

[James]
It is locked.

[Rusk]
Hmm. I will try to kick it down.

[James]
I don't think that's even possible right now.

[Manaia]
Do you wish to be bullied into trying?

[James]
You try to cut it down. I'm hoping that you could, like, try to damage the door itself. I don't think that you could try to just, like, force it open, though.

[Rusk]
Alright, so what would I roll for that?

[James]
An attack?

[Rusk]
I think... I must target before I make an attack. What?

So it's not letting me actually make an attack roll because I'm not targeting anything? I'll use this guy.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, use him.

[Rusk]
And I'll just make multiple attacks.

[James]
No, you get two attacks.

[Rusk]
Oh, alright. So these two would hit?

[James]
Yep, two would hit. Uh-huh, well you stabbed through it twice. You do manage to get through it a little bit, and the water is...

The high-pressure stream is draining out of the other side.

[Rusk]
Hmm, I'm not sure if that's a good thing, but, uh...

[James]
At least you bought yourself another round, at least.

[Rusk]
Yeah, okay, that's my turn.

[Manaia]
Manaia! Cool. Eh.

How does that do?

[James]
That person from the... Real quick, I'll ask this later, never mind. That's a failure.

Ow.

[Manaia]
Okay. Oh, whoops.

[Kuji]
Sturgy! Sturgy... Hmm.

Heh heh heh.

[James]
You can also attack the keystone physically, or you can attack the door physically. Door at this point has... The door has fewer hit points at this point.

[Kuji]
Nah, the door is hurty hurty. I'm gonna move over here. I'm gonna target the door, and I'm gonna do a...

Gouging claw. For a 10 damage.

[James]
Okay, it is... Significantly split open. Between the two of you.

[Rusk]
Almost there.

[James]
I would say, uh, I've done a couple of hits, and... Oh, that was a, uh... Ooh, okay.

Those two actually went rusk.

[Rusk]
Ow. Alright, how many did you just hit? Alright, well that's a critical.

Ooh.

[James]
Yeah, no, I... Smashed the rest of this thing open, a bunch of dwarves come tumbling out. Uh, their machine has...

Their machine is, like, underwater pretty much at this point, and is steaming. They shout, we gotta get out of here! Heh heh heh.

I agree, let's go. Like, we can... We can tell you later!

Okay.

[Manaia]
Just before we go, can I bully this last Nyxie for her stuff? Oh, she's good. The one that's still alive.

Okay, thanks.

[James]
So is the hippocampus. It's fun, though, it's a really...

[Rusk]
Alright, let's go.

[James]
Just gonna drag you all back out to, like, the beginning of the dungeon. Ooh!

[Speaker 6]
Mwa ha ha ha ha! Ah!

[Kuji]
Out of the, uh... Good breath. Does that mean I can stay back a little bit longer to, uh, help salvage the room?

[James]
When you say help salvage the room, what do you mean?

[Kuji]
Like, just because it's flooding, and I can hold my breath 25 times as long as it's normal.

[James]
No, no, when you say help salvage the room, what does that mean?

[Kuji]
Will look in the room for anything valuable.

[James]
Yeah, you guys get the valuables.

[Kuji]
Even from the savage room?

[James]
The dwarves? Oh, from the dwarven room? Okay.

So the room that the dwarves were in. Yes, I would say that you can. That's a good idea.

I'm sorry for snapping at you. I thought you were... I was like, what?

I was like, all the loot in this room has already been acquired. What else could you possibly, uh, care about here?

[Mantra]
Wait, did you loot Mantra yet?

[Kuji]
They can bring back Mantra. Will you take your coats with us? Thank goodness, yes.

[Manaia]
We are tucking you under our shoulder.

[Mantra]
Well, I don't know what you expected from the dwarves, but you can take the potion and stuff.

[James]
I leveled up! Did all of you level up? Oh my god!

It was a lot of XP. I told you it was a lot.

[Rusk]
I knew this was worth it. This was a great idea.

[James]
I mean, it would have been not worth it if you all died. One of us died!

[Rusk]
So, because my character follows Gorm, I literally have an anathema against retreating.

[Manaia]
So you would have died if we abandoned you, basically.

[Rusk]
I mean, if I retreat, I have to spend like a week just repenting for my sins. You would have died.

[James]
He would have been enslaved by the Nixies.

[Rusk]
Yeah, that's probably not a bad, that's a worse fate.

[James]
I think I would have also pissed off the god. I can see it happening, I'm sure. Okay, somebody joined in.

Yuri? I cannot see anything about there. What happens if you guys click on their thing?

[Manaia]
Oh, it's like we got... you know when you get blonked?

[James]
Yeah, but they're in the Pathfinder server, so what's going on there?

[Manaia]
We don't have... they left. They left the server.

[James]
So normally it doesn't like... No mutual servers, that's... see that can't be true, what the fuck.

[Rusk]
Strange.

[Manaia]
Maybe they're just like, actually I hate everyone here and blocked us all, which...

[James]
Can't be delivered, who fucking knows? And I can't ban them anymore because they left. Which is normally what I like to do, if somebody joins and then bounces, I prefer to ban them.

[Manaia]
How strange, how strange. What the fuck.

[James]
Delete their messages.

[Manaia]
Congratulations everyone! Most of us survived, we have to revive the other one.

[Kuji]
We have to go to revive the other one? No, you don't have to.

[Manaia]
You're fine with being dead? Yeah. Okay.

[Kuji]
New character, better character. Yeah, who cares?

[James]
New character time.

[Rusk]
Death is part of the process. Characters want to revive, I'm sure.

[James]
Well it's important if the character being revived would like to be revived.

[Mantra]
And they're gonna consent to it, like they don't want to be dead. Yeah, well...

[James]
How do you know that? So the other thing is the party is nervous about... If they get brought back, they will be level 2.

Alternatively, if you wanted, you could bring them back for free by taking the ghost dedication. If such a thing would interest you.

[Manaia]
Do you want to be a ghost?

[Mantra]
Do you want to be a ghost? Being a ghost is actually really good.

[James]
No, please be a ghost, this has happened before actually. I'm gonna use the restroom.

[Manaia]
Okay, so because you reached level 2 by sheer miracle, you can take the ghost dedication now.

[Mantra]
I'm just looking up the ghost dedication thingy real quick.

[Kuji]
Okay.

[Manaia]
Of all the undead dedications, it's one of the better ones.

[Rusk]
So should I level- okay, question, do I level up right now or after this session?

[Manaia]
You can just level now, but deal with your stuff later.

[Rusk]
Oh, okay.

[Manaia]
Yeah, just hit the level button just so you can get the HP bonus and stuff.

[Rusk]
Wow, my HP jumped up from like 23 to 36. Wow, okay.

[Manaia]
Yeah, it's awesome, eh? And then, you know, you can do it off the wall.

[Rusk]
It's awesome, I know, I know.

[Manaia]
And then you get to finagle your stuff a bit later if you don't want to deal with it right now.

[Rusk]
I want to do it right now simply because I'm here and if- Alright, you have a good one.

[James]
Nice.

[Rusk]
Okay, so, now I have questions.

[Kuji]
We might have answers. Yeah, might have answers.

[Rusk]
Alright, so. Uh, the guy?

[James]
You want to re-roll that?

[Rusk]
You have a free re-roll.

[Kuji]
So, his plan was, he was planning not to die instantly and use the hero point to stabilize. That was his goal.

[Manaia]
Yeah, but when he was going to get knocked out anyway- But you know what? I honestly respect the, yeah, okay, I'll just die thing, but like, wow. That's impressive.

[Kuji]
Yeah, because that guy fucked up. But his plan was that he was expecting to get knocked unconscious and then use the hero point to stabilize.

[Manaia]
Oh, yeah, I figured.

[Kuji]
And so that's why I was like, nah nah, I don't want to use it to re-roll because that's the chance. How do I do this? Do I drag?

Like, he wasn't in any chance of dying left, there was a TPK.

[Manaia]
I figured, I figured.

[Kuji]
But- Alright, I have to do this, okay.

[Manaia]
This went very well. Especially for the first game, first character.

[Kuji]
Alright, my character is now decent. He can now do his main effect. Yay, level 2!

[Rusk]
I have a very important question that sounds fun in my head.

[James]
What's up?

[Rusk]
So I heard we're doing free archetype, like free dedication at level 2. And I want to have the Barbarian dedication. And they have an instinct called Giant Instinct that lets me get big.

And I'm hoping it lets me wield a big fucking shield. Like, just this ginormous shield.

[Kuji]
Are you using Tao Shield at the moment?

[Rusk]
No, this is my first session with this character, so I'm planning on like- His previous Tao Shield broke. I can take this dedication, it's more so it tells me to select an instinct. Now, I do know I have to take a feat later on if I actually want to use my instinct ability.

But, it'll be worth it, so.

[Manaia]
I'm going to take a small, tiny break in between the fact that we have two sessions now. But, before we do so... Loot!

That's fucking weird.

[James]
So that person who joined... What? That person who joined and bounced was in the Pathfinder Discord.

They're in the Pathfinder RPG Discord. How the fuck did they- What the fuck? That's weird.

I don't know. These people. Yeah, I saw the post about Kingmaker Wisp marches.

They were definitely in the Pathfinder 2E Discord.

[Kuji]
They might have bounced both of them.

[James]
Why did they just- What the fuck? People always trash? I think that they were- I don't know.

I get weirded out by that kind of behavior. I don't know what's going on there. Like, if they're just scraping server data or whatever.

Eh. I get conspiratorial. Oh, Marco's still there?

What's up?

[Manaia]
Oh. You said there were two that left? Who was the second person who left?

[James]
Oh, BKArk was one of them.

[Manaia]
Ah. Loot time, loot time. I'll put the dead things in the party's map, but I cannot take from the living.

[Rusk]
You know, this actually seems like such a fun idea. I'm gonna send this to you, James. I'm gonna post this in voice overflow.

[James]
Oh, that reminds me. Let me have this lady give over her stuff as well.

[Manaia]
Thank you.

[Rusk]
I think this is a very fucking cool thing to pick up. Now I'll have to pick up a feat to actually use this, but I love the idea. That now all of a sudden my- That is very cool.

[James]
Also, clear everything from this, uh, clear everything. From the party stash. Okay.

Anything that is not clear gets deleted.

[Manaia]
Alright, quick question. Don't champions have spells, though? Yes.

You're fine with giving them up?

[Rusk]
I'm fine with giving them up, and the interesting part is, if I violate the anathema, I lose the instinct's abilities, but I can still rage, so I basically just lose that benefit down there. And it's more so if I choose to use a spell, it comes with a downside. Like, I'm not able to gain this benefit, but if I don't have to cast a spell, it's a net buff.

[Manaia]
Okay, so in case of an emergency, and it does say if you violate it, you only have to spend a day to recenter yourself. So, in case of emergencies, then. Okay, that's cool.

[Rusk]
And the benefit is, it lets me actually heal when I rage, and- Nice. I think the biggest downside is if I willingly accept magic effects from spells, I get frightened one. But, honestly...

[James]
That's a pretty cool mechanical- oh, bless you! Like, mechanical exploit. I think it's cool.

[Rusk]
And if I see someone casting a spell, I deal a lot more damage to them.

[Manaia]
Nice! You're just like, how dare?!

[Kuji]
Might need to be very mindful about that as a champion.

[Manaia]
Okie doke! Alright you guys, please look inside the party stash and tell what you would like. And remember, if it casts magic, make sure you're able to cast magic from that tradition.

[Rusk]
Okay, I need to take a look at the party stash. Where is the party stash?

[Manaia]
Okay, so if you go into where you see the actors, do you see where it says the party?

[Rusk]
Yes.

[Manaia]
Okay, you see where you can open and close the folder? Right next to it is a little paper. Click the little paper.

[Rusk]
Open sheet?

[Manaia]
Yes. Do you see the overview exploration stash?

[Rusk]
I'm guessing I go to stash?

[Manaia]
Yes.

[Rusk]
Okay. This actually is a very useful tool.

[Manaia]
Indeed, indeed. And you can see what other people have in their inventories. Also, I learned the hard way that if you try to give anything to your familiar, like drag and put it on, it just gets eaten.

It gets deleted from both your sheet and the familiar does not receive it. I don't know where it goes, but don't do that.

[Kuji]
I lost a bedroll too. A familiar doesn't have an inventory.

[Manaia]
Yeah, but I thought you would either say you can't give it, or you would put it somewhere else.

[Kuji]
It doesn't. It just gets... Well, the thing is, it drops on the character's sheet, so it takes up the sheet, but there's no way for it to enter the data.

[Rusk]
Okay, so I drag things into my inventory, and that's how I get the gold.

[Manaia]
Yes, but do say what you want first before doing that, so we can...

[Rusk]
Okay. I already took a treasure. What did you take?

The top one.

[Kuji]
Because I want to get a tower shield. Essentially, there's 500 gold worth of stuff.

[James]
All right. SmellyLemon would like to be resurrected.

[Manaia]
Okay.

[Kuji]
Do we have anyone that can res him?

[Manaia]
We will have to pay the 75 gold to go to the top one.

[Kuji]
Yeah, no, it's 75 gold.

[Manaia]
Yeah, we have to pay 75 gold to bring them back.

[Kuji]
Did we use the favor to get that, though?

[Manaia]
No, no, no, no. Last time, we still had to pay 75 gold. They were just less annoyed about it because one of my characters had a favor to cash in.

[James]
So probably there will be a favor SW by the temple.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[James]
Like hunting down a demon or something like that. I think it probably will be it. Go hunt down a...

[Kuji]
So essentially, there's 500 gold worth of items for each person.

[James]
For each person, 500 gold? No, because there's four people. If you get resurrected, there's four people.

[Kuji]
Maybe we don't resurrect him.

[Rusk]
I don't like the idea. Sharing is...

[Manaia]
Okay, look, we can resurrect them, but if you really don't want to pay them out, that can be done later or whatever, but... We just set 75 gold apart, okay? And then, let's see, minus 35 divided by...

About 400 for each person.

[Kuji]
With the item that thingy took, there was roughly 1500 gold in there. A bit over 1500 gold. He took one of the gems.

[Manaia]
Okay, and how much gold was that?

[Kuji]
I think it was like 125 or something.

[Manaia]
Okay, okay.

[Kuji]
So total worth was roughly 150 in there. I'm sorry, 1500.

[Rusk]
Does the striking energizing dancer's spear have extra range or something? It is a reach weapon.

[Manaia]
Listen, hey guys, if we divide it by four people, it divides better among four people. Because 1512 divided by four is 378. Perfectly.

[Kuji]
I mean, 1500 divided by three is 500. Guys, stop mathing.

[Manaia]
You're right, it's 578.

[Kuji]
Who the hell cares about math?

[Manaia]
You should divide perfectly that way.

[Kuji]
No, no, I was just saying, for an easy way, if you do like 500 worth of items, it'd basically be evenly between us.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, alright.

[Kuji]
Because QG is a melee character. So I mean, that spear would be amazing.

[Manaia]
Speaking of melee, can I have my knife back?

[Kuji]
Yeah, sure. Can I also get my crowbar back?

[Rusk]
What a fucking loot whore. I'm putting them in the stash.

[Manaia]
Okay, that's fine. Yay, my knife's back.

[Rusk]
My character doesn't need to be a loot whore, it's not a rule. James, I will grab everything in this stash, it is now mine.

[Manaia]
Absolutely not. Christ.

[James]
You might be able to take the other two, I'm not sure.

[Manaia]
Please don't fight me.

[James]
That caught might have worn off.

[Manaia]
Okay, anyway.

[James]
If you initiate PvP with somebody, your character's going to go away for a little bit to be an evildoer somewhere.

[Kuji]
But can return for PvP. Does your character actually use a weapon or is he using shields? And just pummeling stuff with shields?

[Rusk]
Pummeling stuff with shields, that's like my whole class fantasy.

[Manaia]
Okay, would you...

[Rusk]
Is there a way I can grab the shield? Yeah, you can. Pretty much, as long as it's not a shield, I care less.

I just want enough gold to maybe buy some better armor. Work on shield stuff.

[Manaia]
Sorry, that was interrupting for no reason. Ignore that.

[Rusk]
Okay, pretty much, if it's not related to shields or upgrading shields, it's for the taking.

[Manaia]
Okay. Is there anything else you want from there besides the gem?

[Rusk]
The charm of cold resistance, since I'm in the frontlines, I could take a lot of damage in that regard. I think that would be nice.

[Manaia]
Go on then.

[Rusk]
Is there anything that you guys want?

[Kuji]
You should probably grab the axe, because it's always amazing to have a magical weapon just in case, if needed. The hand axe?

[Manaia]
He could put a rune on his shield, though, to make it diamond.

[Kuji]
Yeah, you could potentially swap that rune over to a weapon. Head out so I can talk to my girlfriend. Wait, wait.

Just before that, did you want to take the shock wand?

[Manaia]
I can't use the spell, but I do have a character that can, and they do know each other. Have a good one, James.

[James]
You can't just trade it to him, but you can trade items.

[Manaia]
Yeah, I'm going to have to do an equal trade, which will be difficult.

[Kuji]
Can you sell everything else and then share the gold between us?

[James]
Can I sell everything?

[Kuji]
No, I think you guys can hit the button.

[Manaia]
I can do it, I can do it.

[Kuji]
Don't you have the option where you can share gold and then sell everything?

[Rusk]
You have to put it into a loot container to spread it evenly. Okay.

[Manaia]
Tell us, I can do it.

[James]
You can also do that if you want to log into your referee account.

[Manaia]
Oh yeah, you can do that.

[Kuji]
I just thought you could just log in here and swap. That's it.

[Speaker 1]
Great. Pot, could you please describe Kamon in the familial?

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Kamon stands at a pretty decent 5'10", 5'11", and she has long white hair that's put into curls and dark brown skin. You can probably tell that she has a bit of the Kitsune energy to her, but she is currently in her tailless or humanoid form and doesn't seem inclined to change otherwise.

The orb is an orb. It sort of flies around her and seems to be humming a nice tune as it follows her. She's dressed in mostly white and gold clothing, sort of like she is going out for a shop rather than a proper adventure.

[Speaker 1]
And that's the character. Great. James, are you here to describe Mechanon?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yes, I am. Mechanon is a giant-ish fey creature who has constructed his form, or reconstructed his form, out of some simple non-animate, inanimate objects to resemble his original form as a pureball. And he wields a piece of investigator with a top hat, a very large forehead, and usually carries around a blackjack or kind of billy club-looking thing, a sap, and a pistol.

Great.

[Speaker 1]
Robin, could you please describe Passus?

[Speaker 5]
Passus is a human wearing leather armor and over top of it very fine clothing, and she's got brown hair and laurels on her head. And she carries an umbrella and a crissknife.

[Speaker 8]
Does that exist in this universe?

[Speaker 5]
Umbrellas or crissknifes?

[Speaker 8]
Crissknifes.

[Speaker 5]
She wields a weird-looking knife.

[Speaker 4]
Looks like I don't have darkvision, huh?

[Speaker 1]
And last, could I have Verhi, can you describe Ver?

[Speaker 6]
Ver? Yeah, he's a small ratfolk who's quite pale, like Ver. He's in some common explorer's clothing, almost kind of like a robe.

He has a little tattoo that seems to come alive as the rat jumps out of his skin, stares about, and jumps back in. And he seems to be walking around with his staff and a spell ledger.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, you get a woman leads you to the cave. She says that she seems a bit spacey, and she says she's investigating haunts in the area, and she is quite busy. But if you need any information, you can come and ask her any questions.

But you get the feeling she wouldn't be much help, even if you did. Skip me. Oh, sorry.

Meryl.

[Speaker 8]
Meryl is human-looking, about average height. Black hair, dark eyes. Very serious and somber-looking.

Wearing armor and carrying a sword and shield. That's it.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, sorry about that. You get to a cave. It's dark in the cave.

If you would like to light a torch or anything, please do. It's as you get further down that you start to hear the sounds of something moving beyond.

[Speaker 3]
I have to ask, did we get the name of the person we're looking for?

[Speaker 1]
We're hunting down insignias, right? Yes. If they have become undead, they will be on the precious body.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well. Pragmatic.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. As you get closer, the cave narrows, and you get to the entrance. You hear sounds just beyond where the map starts.

[Speaker 4]
Was the NPC out here, or was the NPC somewhere else?

[Speaker 1]
She's outside the cave. A couple minutes' walk from where you are.

[Speaker 4]
None of us want to go there and talk to this person first? Or are we going in the cave to see what's out there?

[Speaker 8]
I mean, I was just going to head in, but if you want to talk first.

[Speaker 5]
I understand the sign well enough.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah, I'm fine with it as well. Yep, go in there.

[Speaker 3]
I wish the spacey lady a good rest of her day, and say we'll do our best.

[Speaker 1]
She just replies with a warm, oh thank you, you too.

[Speaker 3]
Before she leaves, I ask her if she won't mind giving me her name.

[Speaker 1]
My name's Rana, I am studying for the GradVac Thor. They had other people here, but I think they died.

[Speaker 3]
Good luck! Well, thank you, my darling. You have the best of luck with your research as well.

[Speaker 1]
You wander into the cave, and Merrill, you catch eyes of a large zombie, but it hasn't spotted you yet. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 8]
Um, what would I do? Um, I'm going to look over my shoulder to everybody else and ask if they're ready for things to kick off.

[Speaker 6]
Anything?

[Speaker 3]
I say affirmative.

[Speaker 6]
Just a nod.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know what my speed is. There we go, 20.

[Speaker 1]
We can't really move much further than up here before combat will start, so if you'd like to position yourselves and add yourselves to initiative, you can begin the first combat. Also, I am really sorry that I am disabled in my hearing. If I ever need you to repeat yourself, that's why.

[Speaker 4]
No worries. I'm just trying to figure out what this... Is this character a frontliner, or...

It's been a while since I created her, or him. I'm going to roll their initiatives now, and... Alright, I'll go ahead and roll my initiative.

[Speaker 5]
Are we doing perception only, or can we use stealth if we're outside?

[Speaker 1]
If you're stealthing, absolutely use it. You can't really deceive the zombies, so I won't let you do deception. Oh, yes.

[Speaker 5]
I probably get a penalty to that for holding a torch, don't I? I don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
I'm assuming you all have your appropriate weapons and things drawn as well going into the zombie cave, so in the first round of combat you won't be doing anything like that.

[Speaker 8]
Meryl is going to drop her torch where she is. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Do you know the range of a torch?

[Speaker 8]
I have a dim 40, bright 20.

[Speaker 1]
Someone draw a 40 foot ruler from Meryl so I know how big to put this torch. Just straight down. Great, let's just be on the map.

Okay, I've dropped a torch there. Alright, we're going to begin. Okay.

Persis, you're up first. What would you like to do? Well first I'd like to move a little further into the cave.

Whoops. You see all five of them as you walk past. Ah, just underneath there.

[Speaker 5]
Do I need to tumble through somebody to use tumble through? You did. Can I just tumble?

Alright, let's see. What's it say? You can try.

I probably wouldn't get panache if I tumbled through nothing.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you get to try the check until you move through the space of an enemy, because you need to go against a reflex DC. Fair enough. And ask one of the party to hit you if you'd like.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. No, no, I think we're okay. I guess I'll just throw a shuriken.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, if you press T on the one that you're aiming at, it'll target them, and it'll automatically query the roll against their AC. Really helpful. Great, roll damage.

Won't be very much. It hits it as expected.

[Speaker 5]
And I'm going to take a step further into the cave. Further into the cave, away from the zombies. And that'll be my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Oh wow.

[Speaker 1]
The zombie that is clearly fresher strides up towards Meryl, and is going to attack. It hits. It hits you hard.

[Speaker 8]
Um, how do shields work?

[Speaker 1]
Pathfinder. Do shield block? You need it to be raised.

What if you had your shield raised going into combat? That is one of the exploration activities you can take.

[Speaker 4]
Is there another action that she can take?

[Speaker 1]
She hasn't had her turn yet. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
So you can have your shield raised as you go into combat. What if you'd like to have done that? I'm happy to be a bit forgiving.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
So if you have your shield raised, can you click on the raise action on your sheet?

[Speaker 8]
Exploration?

[Speaker 1]
It should just be in your attacks. Under your shield is raise as an action.

[Speaker 8]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Now, if you click on where it says the damage that you've taken, there's the block button. If you click that, and then take the full damage.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Great. Very good. Um, that is its turn.

They are slowed, so they can only act twice. Great. This one's going to shamble in and do the same.

Oh, whoopsie. The first zombie is clearly not sick. Can I please get Meryl to make this saving throw?

Am I pinging these right? Can you see these in chat? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, I failed. Oh, critical failure. It says I can re-roll?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you will start the session with a hero point. If you would like to spend one to re-roll it, you can.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 8]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on, you save off the zombie-borne illness. This next one comes up and it looks a lot more withered. It doesn't look ill like the first one that hit you.

It's going to make a swing at you as well.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, sure. Guess I can't use field block again.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, unfortunately you get one reaction.

[Speaker 5]
That's... that's unlucky.

[Speaker 1]
That is incredibly unlucky.

[Speaker 6]
Anyone has silly barb? Was someone talking about extra farming experience?

[Speaker 1]
Someone puts you unconscious, your turn moves to in front of his, so you don't get to go until... basically a full turn from now, sorry. That is its turn as well, however.

Which moves us to Ver.

[Speaker 6]
Ver? I'm going to try distract them by casting a meat wall. I'll cast summon undead, and I'll cast upkeep.

[Speaker 5]
That's what will help this situation. More undead.

[Speaker 6]
What are you summoning? I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
May I suggest the predatory rabbit?

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Wait, there's actually a really good one here too. Yeah, predatory rabbit.

[Speaker 3]
I was joking, that's not a good fit for what's happening right now.

[Speaker 5]
That's not? No, ironically, it can jump through them, right?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, but it also has that whole miasma thing.

[Speaker 6]
Huh. But the miasma won't be good here, would it? Skeleton guard?

That's an easy default one. Is that minus one? You can have skeleton guard, yeah.

Yeah, so options are crawling hand, predatory rabbit, severed head, skeleton guard, or zombie shambler.

[Speaker 5]
I thank god we're safe. You opened a portal and a summon hat fell on the ground. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to sell skeleton guard.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I will, uh... What two actions would you like it to take? I'll make it, drop it in and give you permission to view it.

[Speaker 6]
I'll go up and run and attack it.

[Speaker 1]
You should have ownership of that base token. Is that the right one? It is.

You can attack with the scimitar or something if you'd like.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah, I'll go, uh... Forceful sweep!

You've got it? Yeah. What's an attacking marabou?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see. That is a regular hit on the zombie.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, Merrill, we are going for that way. Um, what do you think?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you take it to the injured point. Yep. It takes a bit more damage from that than you would think.

Wow.

[Speaker 6]
And now it's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, before my cannon's turn it is the zombie brood's turn and it gets to there and it cannot fit through.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thank god.

[Speaker 1]
The cannon. Now it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I would like to stride up. I would like to view my character's sheet. And then I think I would like to do...

Is it treat wounds or administer first aid that I should do right now?

[Speaker 5]
It'd be administer first aid for stabilize. If you have battle medicine you can treat wounds, but that's like... You probably don't have battle medicine.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, to stabilize you need to spend two actions to do a medicine check. Uh, the DC equals five plus the recovery roll of the creature, so... It'd be like 15, 16...

Yeah, it'd be 16. DC medicine.

[Speaker 7]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Great. You did it. Uh, Merrill is unconscious but not dying.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that is your last action though.

[Speaker 2]
We move to common.

[Speaker 3]
I just want to end my turn. There we go. Awesome sauce.

So, first I'm going to cast this so folks have a better chance. And I'm going to then cast soothe on Merrill so she doesn't die.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
When you go unconscious I believe you fall prone and, uh... You would drop whatever you're holding, so your... Weapon.

No, your shield though, because you're wearing it.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, right. Let me end my turn. Spent all my actions.

[Speaker 1]
Ended it for you. Jojo, what would you like to do? There are zombies in front of you.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm going to see this. I will move up next to the spawn zombie here, next to Merrill. And, holy crap.

I might run away after this one. I'm going to attack this... Oh, you don't have that for me.

I'm going to attack this guy with my weapon. Yep. 30, 20.

Great. Roll damage. I'll give it 6 damage.

Now, I have a question. Oh, it puts you down. Oh, wait.

It's near death.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no, I shut the door and everything's gone.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's dead. What? Oh, it's piercing damage.

Never mind. I mean, nothing.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if it's automatically added, but is the effect of Courageous Anthem automatically added?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, I can see it. Oh, splendid. There is a status effect.

[Speaker 4]
You said the piercing did nothing to it?

[Speaker 1]
You heard it, it's near death. It's still alive, though. I thought you killed it because of its weakness, but it doesn't have weakness to piercing.

[Speaker 4]
In that case, I'm going to raise my shield while I'm standing here. I have a question about the attack motion opportunity. Do all of them have it?

[Speaker 1]
No one has it. Zombies are probably not going to have reactive strike. It is a fighter feat.

It's a feat that classes get. You can expect a soldier or a guard to have it, maybe. Not a zombie.

Unless it's like a grabbing zombie. These are just regular zombies. I don't know if grabbing zombies exist.

Curiously writes this down. In that case, I'll just stay here. He tries to push his friends, but he can't really get any further than this.

See, I messed them up. Yeah, the last zombie is the same. Whoopsie, I fucked up the turn.

Oh my goodness. This doesn't look great right now. I'm going for the top with passes.

There we go. MB. Sorry about that.

[Speaker 5]
I'm actually going to switch browser on my foundry. This is an awkward situation. Do I just keep throwing shit?

[Speaker 1]
Seems pretty good to me.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm just going to...

[Speaker 1]
Great, that one puts it down. It dies. It is destroyed, sorry.

[Speaker 5]
So Meryl's prone and without a weapon on the ground right now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, her weapon's next to her.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm just going to... I'm just going to make another shuriken attack. Yep, that one's a miss.

That's a miss, and a third shuriken attack.

[Speaker 1]
Holy shit, let's go. Reload zero. Oh, that's funny.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's all I got. It's like a rapier, so more damage. Yes, it is, but I'm throwing shit.

[Speaker 1]
The zombie takes a step forward into its dead friends... destroyed friends square. It's going to attack one of you.

I will decide that with the D3. That is a skeleton guard. It's...

I believe that kills your guard.

[Speaker 6]
No! Yeah, it's going to go off. It's dead.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to delete it, if that's okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, well, it disappears, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Perfect. Okay.

Let's get my bad, Merrill. It's your turn.

[Speaker 8]
Am I, like, even conscious?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you got healed. I'm healed, yeah. I applied the health to you.

You've got 11 hit points. It would take one action to stand up, if you wish, and one action to pick up your sword.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, what kind of damage is that?

[Speaker 1]
Sword? I don't actually know what weapon... You do have a sword.

[Speaker 6]
No, no, sorry, what kind of damage was the zombie's attack?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, bludgeoning. That was a punch.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, never mind. Because I was like, oh, I've got resistance 5. But that's piercement slash only.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and the zombies with bows show up, you'll be sad.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know where there's a pick up thing.

[Speaker 1]
That's okay. Just, um, if you've got your sword in your hand, then we know you've picked it up. You've got an action left.

Would you like to smack that zombie?

[Speaker 8]
I'd love to. For the first time.

[Speaker 1]
Very close to a crit. Um, I'm also going to give you a hero point bar. Going down in the first round of combat's pretty rough.

Thanks. Um, but yeah, roll damage. That's a good hit.

[Speaker 8]
Feels like that's not... Oh yes, there we go. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Your sword cuts through it so well. It takes a lot more than you... Well, Merrill probably knows zombies are weak to slashing.

You cut it good. I believe that's your turn finished. We move to Vur.

[Speaker 6]
And I'm going to move up close towards my companions. And then I'm going to dual slingy slashing Gus at the big guy and this one. Great.

[Speaker 1]
Aw. You do have a hero point if you would like to use it.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like I should save it for something important. Then that'll be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
You still can't quite fit through there with the plague zombie there, so he tries to move through but can't. We move to McKannon.

[Speaker 2]
Do I have any troubles moving through allies in a spot like this?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. Alright, cool. You can't stop in their square, but um...

Or you can't attack in their square maybe is the... I don't know. I think you can't end your turn in their square.

Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I would like to... Where are the bad guys at? That's where Persis is.

So we'll move to this side. I'll stride and... I don't know if there's a point to doing your own.

No. Wait, no there is. I'm going to try to devise a strategy.

[Speaker 1]
Go against. Well actually you can just target and roll it. You don't even have to tell me.

Beautiful. Crit.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's a critical hit.

[Speaker 1]
It is a crit.

[Speaker 2]
I have the critical tag, is there anything that I...

[Speaker 1]
If you click critical damage it should roll. The game should know. So that's done.

Your 2d4 for your weapon, your 2d6 for your strategy.

[Speaker 2]
And then...

[Speaker 1]
Crit. No. He is very hurt from...

He's injured.

[Speaker 2]
I guess that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Come on. Your anthem ends.

[Speaker 2]
I don't have to pick up the tally. It's the end of the turn.

[Speaker 3]
So it does. I cast it again. I'll just keep the ammunition up rather than making a new one.

Let me... Still put... Yep.

There we go. And then... Does anyone look like they're half done?

No, I think they're fine. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Or skeleton guard.

[Speaker 3]
The skeleton guard is fine. I will do... Because currently the person who's getting smacked is Meryl.

I'll put a forbidding ward on her.

[Speaker 1]
I'll track that on.

[Speaker 3]
And I'll... I'll be like... Darling, do be careful as I cast the spell.

[Speaker 1]
It's just one on that good. I accidentally did it twice. Yep, that applied.

Very good.

[Speaker 4]
We move to Jojo. Alright. Apparently Jojo forgot about his extra action.

He's going to target this guy looking pretty injured. This little mummy. And somehow try to strike with his rapier.

Yep. Oh. That's not great.

I'm about to throw away this rapier. Alright. You know what?

I'm not too happy with that. I'll try again with the rapier. Minus five.

Yep. Wow. Alright, fine.

I'll raise my shield in this case. And I'll call it a day. I'll stand here to prevent things from getting through.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops. I have... The first action, the shambler strides in.

His last action, he's going to take a swing at Maril. Misses. See, that's how it should go.

I wasn't expecting one to crit you. I'm sorry. The other one is now blocked because of that one.

See, he can't get in. Persis, we're back to you.

[Speaker 8]
I keep looking at that, but it's not what I...

[Speaker 1]
It was a... What was that? Sorry, Bar?

[Speaker 8]
I keep looking at retributive strength, and it's not what I think it is. So I'll just ignore the fact that I posted it.

[Speaker 1]
It's just pinging at T. Oh. Yep.

I don't know.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, it doesn't show up to you guys?

[Speaker 1]
I deleted the message earlier.

[Speaker 5]
No one's ever going to believe what Persis is about to do from here. Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I think she does. We're going to try and move up a little.

And then... A step here.

[Speaker 1]
And then that'll be that.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Three shuriken. Missed.

Ran up.

[Speaker 1]
I clicked and turned at the same time you did. It is the plague zombie's turn. Mechanon just hit it.

I think that's the easiest way to go. It's going to... Go for you, Mechanon.

The fist attack. Coming into contact with that guy, you'll need to make a fort save. And with his second action, he's going to try and grapple you.

Whoops, I had you selected for the check. You cannot grapple yourself. He has you grabbed.

Alright, Merrill. You can see that zombie's just grabbed Mechanon.

[Speaker 8]
Can I hit it without...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. If you roll well enough, he'll cut its arms off, maybe.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I got a success. I didn't know that.

[Speaker 8]
That should be... Drawn, because I have my... Shield up.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, it'd be on your shield, which you've got already drawn. Can I use that longsword? Roll your damage for the attack first.

Oh yeah, sorry. It's all good. Oh, it just survives that.

It's near death.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know if I can use both the longsword and the shield.

[Speaker 1]
It would have the multi-attack penalty when you attack. But you have hit it by plus five, so that's still a hit. So roll damage.

Mechanon is no longer grabbed. You like slam it into the wall as you crush it.

[Speaker 2]
You've got an action left.

[Speaker 1]
What would you like to do, Merrill?

[Speaker 6]
You have to use an action every turn to raise your shield. I don't know if you want to plan to use it and get the benefit of it. Yep.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, then I'll... I will have raised my shield.

[Speaker 6]
Great. Good choice.

[Speaker 8]
I guess it's a toggle. Oh, one round.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to move over here to get a better line of sight of everyone. And then I'll do a slash and gust on this guy and the big guy. Oops.

[Speaker 7]
Thirteen. Hey!

[Speaker 1]
Is it the same damage roll for both creatures? I think so. Is it the same attack roll for both creatures?

I think so as well, too. Okay. Make a spell attack roll against each target's AC.

It sort of hits the big guy and bounces off. You haven't hit him. You have hit the little one.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, sorry. I've got to make a second one. Ooh!

It crits the big guy.

[Speaker 1]
It is against each creature? Damn. Yep.

Okay. So I'll apply the eight damage. The eight will be doubled for the big guy.

Is that right?

[Speaker 6]
Is that a roll? So I'm going to crit and take double damage and 1d4 persistent bleed damage. But I don't know how that will affect my bleed.

[Speaker 1]
I think zombies might be in it. Oh, yeah. The game just told me yes.

Let's see. You hit the shambler for enough to injure it. And...

[Speaker 6]
Are these ones also weak, or...? Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's strange. Oh, because he's the target of the spell, I'll just have to do it. The big one is also weak.

[Speaker 6]
Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
2x2 is weak. I screech them.

[Speaker 6]
My mastery of the undead is unparalleled.

[Speaker 1]
It's now its turn. It cannot move in. Oh...

Yeah, no, it can't. It physically can't fit there. It can.

[Speaker 8]
Hello!

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to... Oh, there's no point to me doing that just yet. No throne weapon.

That's upsetting. Oh, I'm going to shoot this fellow. Yeah, let me just roll for that.

Oh... Some damage. Devise a strategy against the big one.

Interesting. Okay. And I will strive...

At one. And that will be the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Come on. Ah, he muted.

[Speaker 3]
I am so sorry. I said I was going to put up my Courageous Anthem again, and then move because I cannot see the other creatures, and then it occurred to me that all my spells are two actions, so I am going to see if a sling does anything. Sure.

I did not equip ammunition. It's fine.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have any ammo?

[Speaker 3]
Apparently, it didn't add... Oh, it's in my bag. That was a my bad.

It didn't count it as equipped, so... Here we go. Alright, I'll roll now.

It won't let me. You know what? That is my turn.

It doesn't seem to be registering it.

[Speaker 1]
You can try and figure it out. No, wait. I got it.

[Speaker 3]
I got it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, never mind. He does have cover for me.

[Speaker 3]
It's fine. I still miss. So now it's my turn.

My turn's done.

[Speaker 1]
You didn't ping your spell. I'm going to go back to your turn so you can do that.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. Cast Courageous Anthem. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Great. Okay. Jojo.

Alright, Jojo's going to step over this dead mummy. Into the streams. He's going to take out his rapier and hopefully do a better job than last time.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to move the zombie out of the way.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, great. Yeah, you hit. And I'll roll for damage.

Nine damage applied to it.

[Speaker 7]
It's dead?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's dead. In that case, I might move in a little bit more. Take a stab at this big lady here.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to move all the zombies into the wall so we can see.

[Speaker 4]
And I will hit it with my rapier with a map of minus four. You can't split movement. Okay!

Oh, you're right. You can't split movement.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, were you going to attack and then move away? Yeah, it's just D&D, that's how it is.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sorry. Do not do that if that's your plan. So am I then stuck here because I can't move again?

[Speaker 5]
Well, you have another action, right?

[Speaker 4]
I have two more actions.

[Speaker 1]
You move, you hit.

[Speaker 4]
You have one more action.

[Speaker 5]
Didn't you step up to the zombie? Oh, I did. Yeah, I stepped up here.

[Speaker 4]
Killed this thing. Alright, so I'll just raise my shield while I'm here then. Sorry, I've been playing a lot of D&D.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to move to the last shambler. It will spend its first action striding. It's going to go for you, Jojo.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Hopefully it's not a crit. Okay, it missed.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Done.

[Speaker 1]
Versus.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to tumble through into and then back out of the zombie space. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to make an acrobatics check against the zombie. Yep, if you targeted it should. Yeah, if you click the acrobatics ping in that text box.

Great. I gain panache.

[Speaker 5]
And then I'm going to use the confident finisher against the big zombie with the shuriken. Cool. That makes me really sad.

Sorry. Can't you panache more than once in a turn?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. Do you have a second action? Yep.

I assume if you can gain the bravado. If you tumble through again I think you could.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm going to do the dip into the zombie, dip out of the zombie, tumble through again.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. You don't need to move your token for that, just roll the check.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, but doing that makes it way more fun. Oh, right, I lose panache at the end of turn, don't I? Ah, well...

That's why it doesn't matter.

[Speaker 1]
Merrill, your turn, there's a new shambler in front of you.

[Speaker 7]
Did I lose it?

[Speaker 1]
Ah, let's see, you didn't do multi-attack penalty, but you have hit over... you get that hit still. It's banged up as you bonk it in the head.

There. Great spell for this. Now you kill it.

Excellent, now the brute can finally fit in. It's squeezed in the gap as it steps forward.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's going for sure.

[Speaker 5]
Jojo, you may take a lot of damage here, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

[Speaker 4]
Um, that's a hit, yeah. Oh, damn, 12.

[Speaker 1]
It uses its pre-action improved push. I'm going to attempt to shove you, Jojo. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to roll a strength against it.

[Speaker 1]
It rolls against your DC. I had you selected, I did it again! Oh my goodness.

Great success. You push your... Target 10 feet away from you.

He shoves you there, and then steps forward, which would trigger Merrill's reactive strike, if they have it.

[Speaker 8]
Yes, I do.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, never mind, you would have been able to do retributive strike before the push happened, but that's fine, roll the attack please. Okay. The ally gains resistance to all damage, equal to 2 plus your level.

So, Jojo would get 3 health back from that.

[Speaker 4]
Are you applying the damage, or do I need to do that?

[Speaker 1]
Just heal yourself for 3, please. It's the easiest way.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, alright. You hit me for 12 last time, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so you would take 9 damage.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, the damage is not automatic, huh?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no it's not, sorry. If you would like to apply damage, I can. I already applied it.

You hit that zombie good. It's injured. Ah, that is its turn.

Mechanon, you're up.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm gonna have to wait 13 seconds to torture my cat. Well?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry, that zombie's off guard, because it's squeezing.

[Speaker 2]
I'll keep this one simple. Gonna devise a strategy. Oh, it doesn't update automatically at the bottom of the chat, so I thought I rolled a 1 again.

Yes, I'm gonna fire at it. Yeah, that hits. And then I'm gonna try to shoot it again.

[Speaker 1]
Great, 3 hits.

[Speaker 2]
And that would be the end of my turn. How do I end my own turn? End turn, there we go, cool.

[Speaker 3]
Come on. Oh, we shall be casting Courageous Anthem once again.

[Speaker 1]
Wow.

[Speaker 3]
Who would have thunk it, eh?

[Speaker 1]
I love the Bard spells, they're so good.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. And then, we shall... Who's currently getting pummeled by the big zombie thing?

[Speaker 1]
Jojo just got whacked by it.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, well then you, my friend, can have... Oh, you're right next to me, too. You, my friend, can have Forbidding Ward.

Yes, it let me cast it. So I just put a hand on my shoulder and just be like, you know, be safe.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, so Forbidding Ward, you have to sustain the spell each round, so marrows would have ended. Sorry, I didn't catch that. To sustain a spell, there's one action called sustain.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I will not do that then, I'll just sustain my previous action. Yeah, I take it back and I do the sustain action.

[Speaker 1]
Problem with that is, because the zombie you initiated, you have to cast it on an ally and an enemy. It applies, you would need to cast it on the new big zombie.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well then, fine, the thing does end on... Yes, okay, no, thank you for telling me. So yes, I do cast it on Jojo.

Marrow, your defense drops a little bit. Don't die. So it will be on Jojo and the giant creature.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, that's what it applies. Giant warthog, come on.

[Speaker 1]
Did you come on move that turn?

[Speaker 3]
I did not, I'm still in the same place I was.

[Speaker 1]
Great, I think you're all done then.

[Speaker 3]
Yep, I'm all done.

[Speaker 1]
Jojo, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm going to do my normal attack with my rapier.

[Speaker 5]
You should do the tumble through thing I was doing too.

[Speaker 4]
Do I have that? Yeah, you're a swashbuckler, right? Oh yeah, I do tend to tumble through, what does that do?

[Speaker 1]
What a swashbuckler are you?

[Speaker 4]
Straight up to your speed, move this. What if this is a duelist? I don't know what Jojo is.

Oh yeah, I'm not trying to go through her space. You can just dip in and out. But I'm already here face to face with her.

Fair, but it's for farming panache. Alright, I'll just do the normal rapier strike. Sure.

That hit? Yep, that hit. Total damage.

Big damage. 9 damage, near death. Second action, I'm going to do it with my rapier.

Sorry, not my rapier, my other weapon. Oh, quickness. Okay, I'll stay here and just raise shield.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Oh my god, it skips off the dead ones. Now it doesn't.

Persis, it's your turn, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 5]
Ah, there we go. She's going to draw her crissknife. She has panache, she's going to do the thing.

She's going to confident finish her big zombie. Do it. That's...

That's good for us. Deadly d8, face damage 1d4, precise strike.

[Speaker 1]
How do you want to do this? You kill it. Wow, that's...

[Speaker 5]
Persis has been, like, waiting for this exact moment. And seeing it finally come, calmly takes out her strange orbly knife. And dashes between its legs, cutting one of them basically off.

[Speaker 1]
It just falls to the ground lifelessly. Now if I end the encounter, that should have automatically given you 106 XP.

[Speaker 7]
Yippee!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'm going to move these zombies back now because... Can you access the inventory of the plague zombie? Yes.

It has an insignia. It is one of the insignia you're looking for.

[Speaker 5]
Great. Rapidly pocket it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, those things are inventory, okay.

[Speaker 3]
So who's looking less than healthy?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I have... I only have... I'm down 9 HP.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I figured that Marrow would have become wounded when getting up from going down, which means nothing yet.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so... Who has good training in medicine? Yes, that is supposed to happen.

Okay. Who's trained in medicine?

[Speaker 4]
Persis is just gonna put both of her hands palm up. I'm trained.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Alright. Marrow's the one that's plus 4, and Ver is plus 3.

So, um... In character, I suppose. Ver, darling, do you mind helping Marrow with patching up a mechanic gun?

And you should also look at your own wounds, Marrow. Seem a little... just a bit scuffed, you know?

Unless you guys would like to go on Fords, in which case that works too, but...

[Speaker 8]
No, it's definitely a good idea to take care of things first.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Do any of you have Healer's Tools?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Do any of you have Healer's Tools?

[Speaker 4]
I only have one Healing Potion.

[Speaker 3]
Nope, I do not invest in that.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, um, I should have Lay on Hands, but I couldn't figure out how to add it to my sheet.

[Speaker 5]
Uh...

[Speaker 2]
I have Healer's Tools.

[Speaker 5]
You gotta add it as a focus spell.

[Speaker 2]
I also have, like, five hit points left, I think, so I could also use some assistance.

[Speaker 5]
Wait. That was Bar?

[Speaker 8]
Hang on. There we go. Okay, I got it now.

Thank you. I don't know if it's in your ritual or what.

[Speaker 1]
Oops. I didn't have to say that. That was me typing.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Uh, spellcasting type focus, and then spell attack DC, Divine Charisma, or... You're a champion, right?

[Speaker 8]
Uh, yeah. I'm trying to add it to my sheet, and I can't. Um...

I do not like Pathfinder.

[Speaker 3]
Can I go out and get, you know, the lovely Rana's Healing Kit?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, she's very happy to let you borrow them. I'll stick them on Meryl's sheet if she's going to be healing people. She just asks to have them back when you're done.

[Speaker 3]
No problem. And I give, you know, as thanks, I, you know, pick up her hand and put a kiss to it. Bye-bye, darling.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, bye.

[Speaker 4]
Who was that Leon hand on? I didn't realize I was on mute.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, Vera's very happy to assist in helping patching people up. It'll be good to get some experience living people.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, fantastic.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to say that that's probably the moment where Parasys, like, scrounges the corpses and finds the insignia. I know I just kind of, like, grabbed it.

[Speaker 1]
It's on its chest. It's, like, it's, like, sewn to its shirt. So you just, like, lick it off with, like, a sword or knife or something and you've got it.

[Speaker 4]
That Leon hand, is it, like, the pool of HP she has?

[Speaker 1]
It does what it do. You cast the spell and then someone gets six HP.

[Speaker 4]
But there's no pool, right? Like, in D&D, where the paladin gets, like, 25 HP.

[Speaker 6]
Nah, I don't think it's a pool. I think it's just a heal.

[Speaker 1]
It's a focus spell. You get focus spells when you refocus back. It's sort of like Warlock in 5e, where you get those spell slots back after a short break.

[Speaker 6]
I was just confirming, with Concentrate spells, does that limit on how many you can have Concentrate spells on?

[Speaker 1]
Concentrate spells... The trait Concentrate actually doesn't refer to maintaining a spell. Concentrate is the manifestation of spell through, usually, vocal components.

You need to be able to concentrate to cast the spell. If a spell needs to be sustained, it has it as a part of the spell. So, for example, going back to Khamon's Forbidding Ward, you can see the duration is sustained for up to one minute.

Every round, Khamon must spend an action to sustain the spell. So, if you had a second spell, you hypothetically could sustain two. Witches are very good at sustaining spells.

They get special features for it. But you can sustain multiple spells. Concentrate, though, is not sustain, of course.

Sorry, I have autism.

[Speaker 6]
That's funny, because I've got Flashing Gust, and it's got the Concentrate spell. I'm like, ooh, can I do that while I'm also doing the Summon Undead? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
So you would need to spend...

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
So if you were to cast Summon Undead on your first turn for three actions, your next turn could then be Flashing Gust and sustain Summon Undead. Is Summon Undead sustained?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, all the Summon spells are. I believe. So it's just basically like doing a play trait where I'm fuddled or something where I can't do Concentrate spells.

So it's got nothing in regards to any other limitations?

[Speaker 5]
One of the big limitations is you can't use Concentrate actions in Rage. Yes.

[Speaker 8]
Mechanic gets six health points.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect. I was going to ask before, it's like, ooh, wait, my minion died, so I didn't have to worry about it. So I was like, oh, that's sweet.

[Speaker 1]
If anyone would like to grab a Junker or anything, feel free to do that now. We can figure out what's happening for Trait Wounds as well.

[Speaker 8]
All right, I'm going to do that.

[Speaker 4]
Are there spell slots in this game, or there's no spell slot?

[Speaker 1]
It depends on your class, but there are spell ranks, and then you get slots based on your class.

[Speaker 6]
And then you also have a focus pool, which everyone gets a focus thing. And you can spend 10 minutes to refocus.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, which would be a great thing for Meryl to do right now.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I need to heal if possible.

[Speaker 1]
You're able to go out of the cave and regroup, get some sunlight on you, and spend some time healing up. Zombies won't follow you out of the cave, ever.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, splendid. Since Meryl also has the health kit, she can not only lay on hands, but also patch them up with the healer's kit, right? Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Trait Wounds is a serious one.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So, you need to determine what level of training, don't you?

[Speaker 5]
It would just be our level, level 1, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can't do higher than what you're trained in. So... I just added the Trait Wounds macro to Meryl's sheet.

It's under the Exploration Actions. Down the bottom, there's two arrows and a slash with the macro.

[Speaker 6]
So, just going to try the DC-15 check? Oh, Bar, you're muted.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I only just realized. Uh, what? Who's Trading Wounds?

[Speaker 6]
Is it Meryl? I think Meryl had a 4, where I had a 3, and I was going to assist.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, roll the aid check, which is also a medicine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah, that's going to be cool. What do I need to look at for medicine?

[Speaker 1]
That does nothing.

[Speaker 6]
Turns out practicing on corpses doesn't help with living people.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you'll get a pat on the back, being like, well you tried your best.

[Speaker 1]
Could I have two more as you help with everyone's? There are three people that need Trait Wounds, so just do them now and we can get Bar to roll those. Ha ha ha ha!

So, on the third, you can decide what order people are getting healed in.

[Speaker 6]
I'll do people- who's unique? I want to do whoever has succeeded on the most unique person.

[Speaker 1]
Probably Mechanon.

[Speaker 6]
His head gets slightly bigger as you do it. My knowledge of humans and elves isn't too great, but you know, these strange creatures, I'm going more by intuition rather than what I know.

[Speaker 5]
Which is more helpful.

[Speaker 3]
How would Verr feel about getting a brush to his scraggly rat hair?

[Speaker 6]
Verr would probably like this.

[Speaker 3]
He would probably what?

[Speaker 6]
Probably like this.

[Speaker 3]
Cool, because Camom's going to sneak up on him to do that, since he is a very scraggly man. So just after you finish with your aid, brush to hair.

[Speaker 1]
You can do an aid check for the aid.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I think because I spend that time trying to assist, don't I? Yes, you do. The 30 minutes of trying to help and I'm getting brushed while I'm trying to help.

I get a little bit distracted. Good job, good job. I'm trying to help.

You can't help, there's hair in your face. These are living people. You are an undertaker.

Too early. Give them some time.

[Speaker 8]
Is everybody healed up?

[Speaker 1]
We just need a couple checks from you, Barr, if you would like to roll. Verr's helping Meryl do some medicine checks. You'll get a plus one.

Sorry, I'll slow down. Meryl has the best medicine stat. She would like to treat some wounds of people.

McCannon gets a plus one when you do his because of Verr helping. Jojo, Meryl and McCannon all need a little bit of treating. If you just roll three medicine checks though, the DC is 15.

[Speaker 8]
Hang on, I have to throw the cat out of my grill.

[Speaker 1]
The opposite of the aid action.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like there used to be some bonus if you summoned undead and you had a body nearby.

[Speaker 1]
Is that a feat? I know there's stuff in the Necromancer playtest that lets you just... That is the Necromancer playtest.

[Speaker 8]
Did you say I get a plus one? Or is that just for McCannon?

[Speaker 3]
Just for McCannon.

[Speaker 8]
Did he apply the plus six that I gave him? The six healing from Leon's hands?

[Speaker 1]
He did pump his hands when... Let's see. Who was that for, Jojo or Meryl?

[Speaker 8]
No, that was for Jojo.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I will give all of you a hero point. Would you like to spend it on that?

[Speaker 8]
No. Does that mean I get two?

[Speaker 1]
You should have two points. Thank you.

[Speaker 8]
Is it just me that's getting the other one?

[Speaker 1]
You need to do two more checks, one for you and one for McCannon.

[Speaker 8]
Alright, critical success for me.

[Speaker 4]
I suppose I'll bust out drinking that potion.

[Speaker 8]
I want to check myself for disease.

[Speaker 1]
Oh good, you would have felt it if you failed that check. You don't need to roll anything. The last thing I will interject is that Meryl could spend another ten minutes to get her focus point back if she would like to.

[Speaker 8]
Yes, I would like to. Can I bust out checking for disease?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you're all good. You would have felt it if you got infected. Okay, you've got your focus point back.

Poor Jojo drinks the potion. Is there anything anyone would like to do before you delve back into the cave? No.

I'm a little nervous.

[Speaker 2]
When you're raped by a pack of...

[Speaker 1]
You already have your weapons and you can stop moving your tokens about. It's someone else's turn to hold a torch. The torch is on the ground still.

[Speaker 5]
There is a torch on the ground, but Perseus also had a torch out that whole fight.

[Speaker 6]
I can illuminate on some shield.

[Speaker 8]
Great. That works. Just a quick question.

The big guy says near death, not dead.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I forgot to mark him as dead. He is very dead. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm questioning about a lead. A source. They had a source.

Somebody had a source for me. It was Manny Manny. I'm investigating this zombie cave.

A source, is what he's saying. I thought that we were looking at a, uh, I thought we were looking at some kind of light pressure grid. I think, earlier.

I don't know. I kind of, I kind of do want to investigate, because like, how big is your critter? This doesn't seem to be a reliable source.

I think I'd better quit. I'm going to go down back and press it. Five times.

Which way am I going? I would like to. We should maintain the pressure on this block.

I should strap it. Everyone have a spare tool. Ah.

Perfect. Perfect. Well, the pressure plate is, is it something that I press it with my hand, or is it something that I, uh, have to watch?

Yeah, I just have to, if it's a tight space, the hope is that I can just take the torch and then kind of wedge it in part of the crag, part of the rocks around it. Hopefully, that has some kind of effect, a bit wrong in here. Five.

Five, one. Five, four, three, two, one. I have an idea.

Listen up, noble team. We're looking at a downed relay outpost 50 clicks from Visigoth. We're going to introduce ourselves to whoever took it out, and then Kat's going to get it back online.

[Speaker 8]
Get me under the hood, Commander.

[Speaker 2]
Sir, why would rebels want to cut off reach from the rest of the colonies? You've got a chance. Maybe you can ask them, George.

Commander, we just lost our signal. Thank you, General. Backup channels.

Nothing. Can't say what's jamming us. You heard her.

Dead zone confirmed. Commander will not be keeping us company this trip. There's the communications outpost.

[Speaker 7]
Could be the missing troopers.

[Speaker 2]
Let's check it out. Oh, I guess we can trip them instead. Yeah, tripping them would work fine.

June, I want your eyes in the sky. Sir. Let's go, Six.

All right, Noble Team. Spread out. Watch the approach.

Eyes peeled.

[Speaker 1]
So where are the troopers?

[Speaker 7]
There's a lot of blood on the ground. Why are we not seeing explosives residue?

[Speaker 2]
Noble Three, can you confirm any EX residue in the area? Negative, sir. I have no need.

Copy. Hey, not our bridge. All right, then we'll just try to trip them up, but we're not going to bring them to death.

Folks across the entrance, folks. Noble Six, move it to the house. Nope, we're just going to hold it across.

It's totally fine. I will hold one end. Who would like to hold the other end for me?

Noble Leader, I'm seeing heat sinks in the structure ahead. And them should I hold? On knees, now!

They're not rebels. They're farmers. Look at them.

Ask them what they're doing here. Table left. Neighbors were attacked last night.

[Speaker 1]
They had screams.

[Speaker 2]
Gunfire stopped around sunrise. Something in the fields killed his son. Commander, be advised.

I'm reading heat signatures in that structure, directly east of your position. Over. Copy that.

Get them back inside. Oh, we got it on the map there. What file?

Yes, there it is. Noble Team, double time it. When they fall, barrel them.

Great. Yes, exactly like that. Damn.

Fill me in, Commander. What are you seeing? Over.

We've got no J casualty. It's two of the missing troopers. Looks like they were interrogated.

It's messy. That's an excellent plan. We've already set up.

Move. Watch your motion tracks. Do you see anything?

[Speaker 7]
I see movement outside the structure. Noble 2, move up to the left.

[Speaker 6]
Damn it!

[Speaker 7]
Cover me! Contact!

[Speaker 2]
Headed into the basement. Move down to the lower level. Foster!

Banshee! It's inbound.

[Speaker 6]
It's the damn Covenant. Cheer up, big man. This whole valley just turned into a free-fighting zone.

[Speaker 2]
Jack, we've got to warn Hogg. I need you at that unit. Find that lovely Caridja Santhem.

Does Caridja Santhem apply to this? Oh no, it's just a tactical... Yeah, that's right.

Oh shit, I got rid of my Caridja Santhem. No! Post now.

Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east. Copy that, dude. We're on it.

Six, we've got one. They got me zero! Jack, we've got to warn Hogg.

I need you at that relay outpost now. Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east.

[Speaker 7]
Copy that, dude.

[Speaker 2]
We've got to warn Hogg. I need you at that relay outpost now. Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east.

Copy that, dude. We're on it. Six, we've got one.

We've got to warn Hogg. I need you at that relay outpost now. Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east.

Copy that, dude. We're on it. Six, we've got one.

I'm just getting a little nervous.

[Speaker 4]
I'm seeing more hostile activity to the northeast.

[Speaker 3]
Noble 3, requesting airlift.

[Speaker 7]
Over.

[Speaker 2]
Get to work, Noble. Contacts.

[Speaker 4]
I'm seeing heat sinks in the structure ahead.

[Speaker 7]
Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east.

[Speaker 2]
Six, we've got one. Looks like we're clear, Lieutenant. Boss, I'm showing mod activity to the east.

I advise you check it out. Roger, dude. Burn roof.

[Speaker 7]
I'm on it. Laying down heavy fire.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's great, because I needed... Okay, I really needed that to be the case. All right, I'm going to...

Yeah, so... We'll devise a strategy. And...

Character action. There it goes. She sets an expiration.

Hogg, devise strategy. Against you. That sucks.

So, I'm just not going to attack that one. That's the route. Oh.

Oh, that's really rough. And... I will draw my...

I'll draw my sap. Say that was the one that wasn't ready. I'll attack with my air repeater this one right next to me.

Jeez. And I'll try to hit with my... Oh.

I have to use it with a creature I targeted. Yeah, so it substituted it for... Well, no, I did have the...

Yeah, that's probably what happened. All right. Let's try it out.

So close. So close. It doesn't count as a crit because it's not flanking, technically.

Because big fruit with a ranged attack... That's okay. Now I will attack with the sap.

All right, that's a miss. All right, cool. That is the end of my turn.

Ow.

[Speaker 7]
Damn, I'm just moving.

[Speaker 6]
Here I come!

[Speaker 2]
You see those troopers? You let me know.

[Speaker 4]
Noble Leader, I'm seeing possible friendly forces under attack, south of your position. Over.

[Speaker 2]
We're under attack. I repeat, Mayday. Mayday 3-Charlie-6, we are under attack by the Covenant.

I got wounded. Cannot hold this position. We need to find those troopers now.

Let's go! Let's go! Noble 3-Charlie-6, this is Trooper Squadron.

We have a meeting with the Covenant. Over. Noble Leader, be advised, I have visual on inbound Covenant broadships.

Hold that position.

[Speaker 4]
Noble Leader, be advised, I have visual on inbound Covenant broadships.

[Speaker 2]
Corporal Travis, 3-Charlie, it's the Covenant.

[Speaker 4]
Be advised, we got hostile broadship inbound. Noble Leader, be advised, I have visual on inbound Covenant broadships.

[Speaker 2]
Clear an LZ. Spartans. Corporal Travis, 3-Charlie, it's the Covenant.

We know, Corporal. Let's get you out of here. Be advised, we got hostile broadship inbound.

Still on 4-Charlie-6. Transport, LZ is clear. Moving for evac.

Affirmative. Transport inbound.

[Speaker 7]
Trooper, off that bird on the double.

[Speaker 2]
Noble 2, sitrep.

[Speaker 3]
You're at the relay outpost. Doors locked. Mechanism's been flushed loose.

[Speaker 2]
Can you beat it?

[Speaker 6]
I dialed up my torch to cut the way through. Gonna take some time.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. We're en route to your location. Clear the courtyard.

LZ's a little hot, sir. Put her down, pilot. Six, break open.

Hold them off for hack-and-hack control. Let's get started. Ah, dammit.

People are, like, perfectly positioned so that I have to stride. And I cannot get my flanking. This is horrific.

Um, question, if I stride, do I... If I stride and end movement, does that, um... I will.

Define a stratagem versus that guy over there. Furthest away from me. Oh, it doesn't go down to the bottom.

Okay. And then I will attack this fellow next to me with a sap. Um, it thinks I'm going to try to use devise a stratagem on, uh...

I'm not able to click it off. That'll hit. Against the other guy first.

Yeah. No, that'll be the approach here. That's good.

Hit. Damage. We got 15.

Which will be with the sap versus this one. I can see the future. You're dead again.

I'm just going to... I'm just going to, uh, push the... Here's what I'm going to do.

I'm going to crack the first one across the jaw. Uh, just kind of into, like, shove him against Meryl. And so that I can...

And I'm going to rest the gun on his shoulder. So I can steady my aim and fire at the other zombie. Thank you.

That was solid. Meryl, thank you for making sure I didn't die. I really appreciate it.

I'm just trying to figure out what's going on here. I'm making attempts to recall knowledge. Meryl, you seem like the, uh, religious sort.

Uh, sort of religious expertise. Oh, how do we initiate, uh, recall knowledge on here? Ah, yes.

If my churn was high enough, and if I could use something like society scale, um, would... Can I try to infer what kind of factions or groups you might be interested in, uh, making zombies out here? I guess Camden's nervous about the idea that Robbie might be doing this.

Only because he doesn't know... But he doesn't know anything about knowledge. Come on.

It's alright. We're not gonna hurt you. George, I got her.

Keep still, and I'll release you. That tank will move past you. Commence number two.

Negative four, stay on the entrance. Two, hand over. Five and six, clear the hole.

[Speaker 7]
There's more, flush them out, I've got you covered.

[Speaker 2]
It's been a pleasure to see you for so long. Noble 5 reporting, targets neutralized. Kat needs you to reset a junction, do it, get back.

[Speaker 6]
How long? A question of my life.

[Speaker 4]
If the question is when will the station be back online, two weeks, earliest.

[Speaker 3]
This is plasma damage, all major uplink components have died. Two minutes is too long. Which is why I'm splicing into the main overland bundle to get you a direct line to Colonel Holland.

You're in my lights, Commander.

[Speaker 2]
Find out what she knows.

[Speaker 7]
What's your name? Do you live around here? I'm Nevin George.

[Speaker 4]
Shara. Shara, c'est pas de résumé. Your accent sounds familiar.

Tangari. Friend of yours? Father.

I'm sorry. Why would you be?

[Speaker 2]
Big man forgets what he is sometimes. She just lost her father. She needs a full psychiatric workup.

She's not the only one. Lock her down, both of you. Get her on her feet.

The body stays here. Thank you, sir. Cigna, it's patchy, but it's there.

I'll take it. Kilo 3-3 and Kilo 3-4, your current LOC is too hot. Roger that.

Dodge, stand by to receive and respond. Yes, Commander.

[Speaker 7]
Coordinates received. Initiate immediate course correction. The Office of Naval Intelligence Swordbase is presently under siege from the Corvette-class hull and castle.

Due to the sensitive nature of this facility, use of orbital rounds has been for the moment prohibited. Regrettably, my efforts to obtain relevant data on enemy forces have been unsuccessful. However, current defensive forces are insufficient.

[Speaker 5]
ONI has requested Team Noble's direct intervention to help secure Swordbase.

[Speaker 2]
All right, people. Give those troopers a hand. KOT-6, you're out here.

George and Neil, you're next. Good prep. Six, push back the attack on Swordbase.

Find out what we're dealing with. I think we should.

[Speaker 7]
Six.

[Speaker 2]
I will be losing thoughts on this one. Push back the attack on Swordbase. Find out what we're dealing with.

Hey, smart team.

[Speaker 7]
Roger that. Bring us back.

[Speaker 2]
Spartans. Hostiles north.

[Speaker 7]
KOT-6. Roger that.

[Speaker 2]
Six, push back the attack on Swordbase. Find out what we're dealing with.

[Speaker 3]
Spartans. Hostiles north.

[Speaker 2]
Six, push back the attack on Swordbase. Find out what we're dealing with. I'm happy to finish up the zombie encounter at the very least before we have to retreat and rest.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Who are we missing? We've got... McKenna.

Just McKenna. Where is McKenna? Oh.

I assume McKenna would be a bit closer if you would like to move him to the party chair. I'm gonna do that for you. All right.

Come on, you're a first.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, word? That's a first. Okie dokie.

Courageous Anthem once again. It's quickly becoming my favorite spell. And I can't see where the zombies are.

They are in front of us, right? If I walk in that direction, would I see them? Hear them?

[Speaker 1]
They're in the room ahead. There's a door just near here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh. Hmm.

I still can't see. I don't think you'll... I don't know how wise it would be for me to...

I'll just do it so I can... So I keep walking. Yeah, there we go.

And that will be two actions. Then I'll need one more in which I shall just attempt a slingshot.

[Speaker 1]
Yup. Oh, a hit. Did you have the new one targeted?

[Speaker 3]
And that shall be my turn.

[Speaker 6]
There. Alrighty, so... Fifteen.

Cool. I don't think I can get through there.

[Speaker 1]
Through us. If you use the arrow keys, you can move your token one spot at a time. Yup.

[Speaker 6]
If your keyboard has them. Two actions to get in there. Yup.

Hmm. Is this, like, a mining thing that's really helpful in this category? And, uh...

I'm a boomer, I don't know how to use that. Anything else, really? Just click check when you're done.

That is my turn. Oops, I wanted to press enter, but I think it went away. I'm not sure what I did.

Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
This guy sneaks up and stabs you. Come on.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, ow.

[Speaker 3]
You'll be off-guard to this.

[Speaker 1]
But he rolls once, so...

[Speaker 3]
So he just takes a quick whiff and I turn around all just like, how could you?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... I'm gonna walk on the stride up to this guy and smack him. Twice, probably.

I'm not gonna think too much about Bar's turns unless it's urgent.

[Speaker 3]
Unless we're hashtag dying.

[Speaker 1]
Two ones in a row, let's go. Two ones in a two, holy shit. Merrill has two hero points.

Three critical misses in a row.

[Speaker 3]
Good lord.

[Speaker 1]
One of those, I've reused a hero point. They get lost at the end of the session. So if you have hero points, use them.

[Speaker 4]
I thought we kept them, alright. At the very end. With a pecking order.

[Speaker 1]
That does not beat stealth DCs, Merrill is not off-guard for this. Neat. Alright, now we move to purses.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna hold my turn until after Jojo's.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. How do I do that? In counter-order there's delay next to you, I can do that for you.

Honey, you got it. Jojo, your turn. I need to find it.

That would have ended.

[Speaker 5]
That'd be two seconds.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, was that Red that said there'd be two seconds?

[Speaker 6]
You here, Jojo?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm here. What would you like to do? It's your turn.

Oh, do you not...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, sorry. Yep. I think at 30 feet of movement...

Where do I... Oh yeah, 30 feet of movement. Yep.

I will use my tumbling roll. I gotta target the creature first, right? Now, do I roll through them or can I roll in front of them?

[Speaker 1]
You have to be through them. But if you step in the doorway, there are more zombies in there. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Let me see. You could hit either of these guys with it. Oh my, she's near death.

Yeah, I'm gonna do my tumbling roll against this thing. I'm gonna have to go read up on it. I'm gonna do an acrobatics check against it.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, if you do an acrobatics success, now you can put yourself in a square near them.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna put it up here. And how do I get that panache thing? Oh, here.

I gain panache. Do I target myself and then click that? Yeah, you drag it onto yourself.

Okay, drag it onto myself. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Great, now the zombie's off guard to your attacks. Hit him.

[Speaker 4]
I did see a confident finisher.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, that's a checkmark at the very top of your actions tab.

[Speaker 4]
You make an incredible graceful attack, piercing your foe damage, making a straight...

[Speaker 5]
So you just do any attack with the... Yeah. You make sure that's checked and you do any attack.

[Speaker 4]
Make sure that's checked. Except throwing weapons. Do I put that on my...

Do I drag that onto my token? You have the checkmark on, on your sheet. I don't see the checkmark.

[Speaker 1]
I've just clicked it. It's at the top of your actions tab. So now if you do your attack, it should just automatically apply, right?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I'll just do my attack against that creature. 17, that's hits. Let's do some damage.

[Speaker 1]
Has that done it correctly? I'll swashbuckle ahead to you. Yep, it's got that 2d6.

[Speaker 4]
2d6, cool. Alright, finally some good damage. You can also turn that damage on manually.

[Speaker 5]
The bit with the finishers is they have a special, like, failure effect. Oh, right, I should have been doing that with the finishers. I've been missing.

But they do the figure per strike damage, which is 2d6 instead of just 2.

[Speaker 1]
I believe Jojo has one more action. And doing your finisher loses your panache, right?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Um... What does this zombie look like? They're banged up.

They're still pretty healthy. This thing has a lot of HP now. I'm gonna be smart a little bit.

I'm gonna raise up my shield. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We move to passes.

[Speaker 5]
She's gonna take a step and she's gonna seek. Because someone got ambushed next to her.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what sort of seek are you doing? The burst or the cone?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Jesus, I should have thought about this.

[Speaker 5]
30 feet or less in any dimension.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they changed it in remaster. Yeah, I think that covers the entire room.

[Speaker 5]
Doesn't cover the very corners, which is difficult.

[Speaker 1]
But I'll run a perception check. Uh, you're pretty confident this is it.

[Speaker 5]
I did a step. I have my knife out and a torch up, which means that I can't use my shurikens right now. So I'm just gonna go here.

Is take cover specifically from Starfinder, or is it also usable here? Take cover.

[Speaker 1]
You spend an action, you're near cover, you press yourself against hover. If you would have standard cover, you get greater cover. But if they walk up behind you and hit you, probably won't.

If they attack you from this side, you'll have plus 4 AC. This is a habit more than anything.

[Speaker 5]
So I turn that from standard to greater?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. And that'll be my turn. Alright, Mechanon.

Oops, you clicked and turned as I did.

[Speaker 5]
My bad. And I remember Courageous Aura's also gonna be up.

[Speaker 1]
If Mechanon would have liked to have been closer than that, that's fine.

[Speaker 7]
I've got a question.

[Speaker 3]
Are you muted, James?

[Speaker 1]
I see you talking, but I can't hear you.

[Speaker 3]
He's not muted, but the sound isn't coming.

[Speaker 1]
What was your question, Heart?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yes. How do you end your turn?

[Speaker 1]
So there's the Encounter tab next to Chat Messages. At the bottom of that, there is Next Turn when it is your turn. I don't know if there's another way to do it.

If you right-click on it.

[Speaker 3]
Hello, hello. Oh, I see. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Much better.

[Speaker 1]
What's YouTube got? Mechanon can get to that point with one move action. I wasn't sure where he would have been standing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's fine. Yeah, I can't really...

[Speaker 1]
So you've got two.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hey. There's that guy. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
There's a zombie there.

[Speaker 2]
Devise a stratagem. Oh, that's exploration. Okay.

I'd like to reroll that.

[Speaker 1]
Dear God, bro. Devise a stratagem is a fortune effect, so I don't think you can. Because a hero point is also a fortune effect.

Okay, I think you're right.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, I'm going to fire at it with my Air Repeater. And this...

[Speaker 1]
Irrespective.

[Speaker 2]
Can I reroll that using a hero point? No, I think it applies to fortune.

[Speaker 5]
I think the roll for the stratagem itself isn't fortune, but the effect for placing is.

[Speaker 2]
This one I'm going to reroll using a hero point.

[Speaker 1]
That makes sense to me. Oh. Oh, no.

That's a rock.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, that's going to be the end of my turn. That's unfortunate.

[Speaker 1]
The devise stratagem action has the fortune trait, so... Yeah, no, I think I was on the money. Move to Kaman.

You are very lucky you didn't get crit by that stealthing zombie.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, so very lucky.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I mean, they did crit, just not the one I like. Heh.

[Speaker 3]
Right, so, we shall be doing... And making sure Merrill doesn't die. And we'll be casting Soothe yet again.

[Speaker 7]
Great.

[Speaker 3]
And that is my turn. Let's see if I can figure out... Ah, here we go, end turn.

[Speaker 6]
There. I'd like to summon Undead.

[Speaker 4]
What would you like and why would you like it?

[Speaker 6]
Did this one up here have a go?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, did you just want the Skeleton Guard again?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I was going to summon a Skeleton Guard up there.

[Speaker 1]
Courageous Anthem.

[Speaker 6]
The most courageous skeleton. Skeleton. Skeleton shall...

Here, take one for the team and try to keep that one busy. Okay, swipey swipey.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. You targeted yourself with that.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, you did target yourself. Let's see. They have an AC of 13, so that's still a hit, so I'm going to just...

Oh, hang on. It'll apply it to you if I do it. So he takes 13 damage.

[Speaker 6]
And then I get two attacks with that, right? Yep, he gets you a second action.

[Speaker 1]
Holy shit! MVP!

[Speaker 8]
Oh, wow!

[Speaker 6]
Shows up, kicks ass, leaves. I didn't do crit for that, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Didn't you? Does that guy have... Roll another d6.

And I'll apply it as well.

[Speaker 3]
Does the Skeleton Guard get Inspiring Anthem, or is it because he was created after?

[Speaker 1]
The game says that he doesn't, the game knows better than me, so...

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
It's something you're constantly applying to allies in range, so...

[Speaker 1]
That skeleton is an ally. That's all of those actions. We move to the husk zombie next to...

Come on. Sorry.

[Speaker 3]
This guy. She's less distressed by the stabbing than she is by the fact that this is nasty.

[Speaker 1]
It just punches you instead.

[Speaker 3]
Ow! Rude. Oh, I still live.

[Speaker 1]
He doesn't have the grab. He's going to try and then stab you.

[Speaker 3]
Again?

[Speaker 6]
Holy shit. So much for living.

[Speaker 3]
Ow!

[Speaker 4]
Who needs to live? Jesus, though.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm down.

[Speaker 4]
Run away! Oh, no. Unconscious.

Jesus.

[Speaker 3]
I did not think it would hurt that much. Oh my god.

[Speaker 4]
Anyone got healing?

[Speaker 1]
Merrill will spend an action to cast... Lay on Hands.

[Speaker 4]
Regain 6 HP.

[Speaker 1]
There you are, come on.

[Speaker 6]
Yay!

[Speaker 1]
And you gain a wounded one coming back from unconscious.

[Speaker 5]
And Lay on Hands it.

[Speaker 1]
You also gain a plus 2 status bonus to AC for one round. Neat. A plus...

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
I've applied that to your token. Merrill then has two actions. She will attack the zombie she's flanking with Jojo.

Ah, what are hero points for?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I was going to ask about flanking. Flanking for the staggered line.

[Speaker 1]
Flanking is a minus 2 to their AC, so it's automatically calculated by the game.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to make an attack at Merrill and one at Jojo. We'll go for Jojo first.

[Speaker 4]
This thing has multi-attack? No, it just has two actions. Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 1]
It's a miss at Jojo. And a... miss at Merrill.

See, they aren't meant to crit twice, nor are they meant to miss twice.

[Speaker 4]
Jojo, it's your turn. Alright, I want to stay here and... Oh, my panache is gone.

Can I roll into it and roll back out? Yes. Alright, that's what I'll do.

Sure, don't bother moving your token, just do the roll. No, it's for style! It's for style!

There we go, there we go.

[Speaker 5]
You want us to do something that makes us lack panache?

[Speaker 4]
I'll be trolling in and out, zipping in and out of this thing. Okay, let me do... Tumbling through, target that creature, acrobatics, roll...

11? Did I miss? Uh...

[Speaker 1]
Failure, your movement ends and your trigger reaction is as if you had moved out of the square you started in. Nothing happens. Nothing happens.

[Speaker 5]
You can try that again.

[Speaker 1]
Use your hero point on it.

[Speaker 4]
Meh. I got that flanking bonus, so I'm just going to stay now.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
And my attack... Oh, my god, okay, I'm going to use my hero's point for this one. How do I do...

[Speaker 1]
If you right-click where you've rolled a 12, that'll be the option to re-roll using a hero point.

[Speaker 4]
I see it.

[Speaker 1]
Nice.

[Speaker 4]
And let's go damage. 9 damage. My last action, I'm going to stay here so we can continue to get that minus 2.

Was that three actions, right? I took three actions?

[Speaker 1]
Tumble, attack, you have one more.

[Speaker 4]
One more? You know what, I'll hit him with my...

[Speaker 5]
When you use a finisher, by the way, you can't use any more attack actions that turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Oh, I used a strike too? You haven't done your finisher this round, that was just...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that was the last round. Attack him again. I can't seem to check on it.

But yeah, I'll hit him again, let's see... You get to do the finisher check when you have finished. Now, do I do the...

The map... The minus 5 or minus 10 since this is my third action?

[Speaker 1]
Minus 5, because you get minus 5 per attack. So if you attacked three times, it'd be minus 10 on the third, but this is your second.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, wish me luck. Nice. Hold on.

[Speaker 1]
Hit?

[Speaker 4]
Alright. It's a good... Oh, okay, damage is damage.

Near death.

[Speaker 1]
It's near death for now.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, yeah, then I'll end my turn. Staying where I'm at. Pressis.

Pressis is going to...

[Speaker 5]
Do a sick flip over my injured companion and twirl around the zombie, tumble through.

[Speaker 1]
I would love to see it. Roll the check.

[Speaker 3]
Honestly, she's impressed.

[Speaker 1]
She just gives you a thumbs up. You can have a hero point. You can have a hero point for that.

That was entertaining.

[Speaker 3]
And I'm just like, oh!

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to add the hero point and immediately use it.

[Speaker 5]
As soon as I can find where they're stored. I can always find them in party overview.

[Speaker 1]
Just right click and reroll and keep the new result.

[Speaker 5]
I went all the way through. That's a failure. I'm targeting the right thing, right?

[Speaker 1]
It's against their reflex, DC. These guys do have reflex, yeah. You're going to get stuck in this square, I think.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to try... I do a sick jump over Cannon. Try and twirl around.

Get stopped. Backflip back over you. She's going to try again.

[Speaker 3]
Just for fun at this point?

[Speaker 5]
For panache. Okay, reset. She takes a deep breath.

Does the exact same thing again, but it works this time. You get applause. And that's going to be...

I will do... I forgot what the... Conflict Finisher does.

I still do half precise strike. So that's half of 2d6 or is that 1d6?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. Whoops, I never added that guy to initiative. He's finished slacking off.

He's going to go at the end of this round. Should I just roll a d6?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I think precise strike is 2 damage.

[Speaker 5]
Precise strike is 2 damage or 2d6 when involved with a finisher.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, roll the 2d6 and then I take half of that. Oh, okay. Sorry, I was distracted by my zombies.

So I take 4.

[Speaker 5]
And then that slashing because of the weapon used is... Yeah. They take 14.

It would otherwise just be precision damage, and I don't think that happens because precision damage gets added to the type. And that's Versus's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Nevermind, these guys only have 5 slashing weakness. A cannon.

[Speaker 3]
I think he's away from keyboard.

[Speaker 1]
It's looking like that. Are you going to delay my cannon until after the plague zombie? Plague zombie is going to attack the skeleton.

[Speaker 2]
That's all good. Actually, maybe I don't stride. Maybe that's a bad idea.

Maybe I devise a stratagem and fire twice. Shit.

[Speaker 1]
Well, devise a stratagem, spray, because this is your investigation.

[Speaker 7]
Fire again?

[Speaker 2]
Which hits, that's pretty cool. 5 damage, and I'll just stride up there.

[Speaker 1]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 2]
I think we're going to take a hit from the party.

[Speaker 1]
The plague zombie goes, it's going to take a swing at the skeleton guard. He hates this guy, but he misses. Second attack.

[Speaker 5]
He hates this guy for good reason.

[Speaker 1]
Skeleton guard solo's the boss.

[Speaker 6]
This is amazing.

[Speaker 1]
Speaking of the owner of the skeleton. It is your skeleton, right?

[Speaker 6]
Yep, I kill my minions. I go, finish him!

[Speaker 1]
Would you like it saying action destroyed? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Skeleton just heroically slashes and hacks him half way through. That rocks. Then he sees the other creature and starts to wander towards him.

Great. And then for my turn, I will point at the two creatures. And I will cast the spell.

Slashing Gusps.

[Speaker 4]
You kill it?

[Speaker 1]
You hit the second? Let's go. It's injured.

Really screwed him. Alrighty, come on. There's one zombie left.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I could try hitting it. I could try hitting it, but also I am very likely to get one shot by it again. And then we'll do this so that the better fighters can do their fun job.

And since I will be out of actions, guess what? We are aiming, we're going to try slingshotting the creature again.

[Speaker 1]
Love to see it. Let's go. Nice.

It's turn. I'm going to flip a coin for who it goes for out of Meryl and Percis. Percis.

And a one will go for Meryl and a two for Percis. Meryl it is.

[Speaker 5]
Lucky that's not me.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, she's out. You know, she's the only other person with healing, right? And I'm out of healing spells.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, fabulous.

[Speaker 3]
That works. Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
There's so many effects.

[Speaker 3]
It's a Russian nesting doll.

[Speaker 4]
She's going to have her ult.

[Speaker 1]
I think it would go for Meryl again, but that doesn't sit right with me killing the character that isn't here. So it's going to turn and go for Percis. I'm sorry if that ruins your immersion.

I would have rolled a one anyway. We're fine.

[Speaker 5]
I forgot to take cover off, but it's a one, so it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Meryl's turn moves to before the husk zombie. We move to Jojo. I did it again.

[Speaker 4]
Jojo, what would you like to do? I'm going to try to attempt my roll into this creature here. Great.

Hopefully I get to bounce off the wall there. Oh, I don't get fail. Yep, failed.

You know what? I'm going to try it again. Oh, god.

Okay, I'll just...

[Speaker 1]
You would end up here on your fail. Where? On the square just above it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I was going to throw my dagger at it.

[Speaker 1]
You can hit it if you'd like.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I will hit it. I will hit it with my powerful attack. Eighteen, then I will hit, and let's go damage.

Big damage. Nine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh! The tumble through says on a failure you gain panache until the end of your next turn. Is that...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 1]
Am I seeing the wrong thing, or is that...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it says failure, failure. What does that mean?

[Speaker 5]
I got two failure effects because we have two effects for... Yeah, you get panache when you fail tumble through. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
We've been doing that wrong.

[Speaker 5]
That's pretty funny. Oh, wait, so I got panache for action.

[Speaker 4]
Failing, we get panache still?

[Speaker 3]
I suppose it's because you're attempting something cool still.

[Speaker 4]
How much damage does panache do?

[Speaker 6]
It changes... I think it's supposed to be in critical fail.

[Speaker 5]
No, so critical fail would be... We haven't had a critical fail for the tumble throughs yet. On a failure, your movement ends, and you stop right where the creature is, and you still get panache until the end of your next turn.

[Speaker 1]
And there is no critical fail for tumble through. It's just the same as a failure. Sorry, what happens with panache?

This guy is really close to dying.

[Speaker 5]
With panache, you unlock finishers, so we'd have to do a finisher attack instead of the non-finisher attack.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to say you kill this guy and do your finisher.

[Speaker 4]
How would you like to do it? Well, I guess I was going to try to roll up the wall, run up the wall a little bit, and come back down and slash him with my rapier to take off his head, or its head.

[Speaker 6]
But instead you do parkour.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, instead I slipped on a banana peel, and luckily my rapier fell out of my hand and poked him in the right spot to finish the boss.

[Speaker 3]
Looney Tunes.

[Speaker 1]
Great, I'll end the encounter and give you some XP. I think for convenience sake, Marrow will stabilize and someone can escort her out of the dungeon, and I think that is a good point to stop for tonight. You gain all of the insignias, though, of the Grudvok Thor.

So you get 20 gold as a reward for handing those in.

[Speaker 5]
There's also some weapons you can steal off these corpses.

[Speaker 1]
They don't. They should have shortswords. There are two shortswords.

Two shortswords and an insignia.

[Speaker 4]
And then there's gold in the party sheet.

[Speaker 5]
So do we get 20 gold as a party?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, as a party you get 20 gold.

[Speaker 5]
And there's 9 gold pieces.

[Speaker 3]
So that means it's 29 in total.

[Speaker 6]
There's 29 gold in total. Do you guys count items towards people's shares for loot? Such as someone gets the rune weapon and then counters it?

You could sell the runes.

[Speaker 5]
Let's put everything in the thing and then figure out the exact value. Because we can look at the party stash's wealth and then divide. We have 70 GP of wealth, so we get 10 each.

Does that make sense?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Before you get to the party stash, there is a bunch of stuff in the loot from the last adventure that hasn't been claimed. Which would not be a part of this.

But if people want to take that, I guess it would just be sitting around.

[Speaker 6]
I see there's more monsters.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, don't open that door or they're going to kill you. If you open the door for a brief second and see a flaming skull on there, shut the door. No.

[Speaker 5]
Parkour. Yeah, let's play Swashbuckler for this.

[Speaker 1]
We do not have time to do that tonight.

[Speaker 5]
Should we just liquify all of the loot?

[Speaker 3]
It would be better to simply split it. It would be easier for people who just want gold rather than treasure. Who just wants gold and no treasure?

[Speaker 1]
The problem is the rune is worth the same value as the gold you got.

[Speaker 3]
Didn't someone just pocket the rune though?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Jojo did pocket the rune in front of Persis. So Persis knows it's there and would definitely raise a stink.

[Speaker 2]
What rune are you talking about?

[Speaker 5]
The weapon potency rune that you picked up.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's a rune?

[Speaker 2]
Can you guys hear me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes, hello. Honestly, that's a good suggestion.

[Speaker 5]
That's better. And it also makes it easy because that's one whole share. That's that whole.

[Speaker 6]
But does Paladin want it?

[Speaker 3]
Probably.

[Speaker 1]
Well, actually, the Paladin should have that because their anathema is they can't grave rob. So if you find any other loot in the crypt next time, they physically can't take it. Right.

Well, there you go. Because that's not part of a grave. The barrel was not a grave, but this absolutely is a burial site.

[Speaker 5]
Also, if you close the loot, then none of us can actually access it. Oh, good. It's open right now though.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. That can be a problem that is solved later.

[Speaker 2]
Could you add 20 gold to the stash though?

[Speaker 6]
Does that mean we got to steal the old stash in there?

[Speaker 1]
I think not. I'm fairly certain the silver was taken from the stash.

[Speaker 2]
Silver was definitely taken from the last stash. I don't know why. I'm annoyed that it's still in there.

[Speaker 1]
I have added 20 gold to the potty stash. Awesome. The space eagle gives that to you in exchange for the sigils.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you, darling.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're welcome. Good job on getting them back.

[Speaker 5]
There is 53 gold worth of stuff, and then Jojo also has that weapon gem.

[Speaker 3]
It was our pleasure. Oh, yes, and of course your healing kit. You might want that back.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I forgot about that. Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
You are most welcome.

[Speaker 4]
What do you guys want to do with the weapon proficiency thing?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the weapon thing? Probably give it to the dwarf.

[Speaker 2]
The dwarf? Sorry, can you hear me now?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, yes. You were saying something about the dwarf?

[Speaker 2]
The cat is being very silly. I didn't mean to. I was just going to leave it there.

[Speaker 3]
I see, I see. Right, yes, the potency ruin probably should go to Meryl because she can't take any other treasure anyway. Grave robbing reasons.

[Speaker 4]
I dropped that into the party sheet. I'll put that on Meryl's sheet.

[Speaker 3]
And now for everyone else, how many party members are here? One, two, three, four, five. Five.

Which is approximately...

[Speaker 6]
There's 53 gold worth. I'm counting seven names in the party list. Two of us put all of us.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah. And you said...

[Speaker 1]
That rat's been putting in some work, Whiskas.

[Speaker 3]
29.

[Speaker 6]
Whiskas was really ratatouille-ing that skeleton. It's minus the...

[Speaker 4]
Probably round up to 30 to make it simpler.

[Speaker 3]
That's about 38. That's rounding up. But otherwise it's 37 pieces of gold, 6 pieces of silver, between 5 people.

Which doesn't divide, right?

[Speaker 6]
I'll take a little bit less to make it even. I don't mind missing out a few silver.

[Speaker 3]
Actually, hold on. If you break it down into copper, it's fine. You can get it exchanged for the coin.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Because then it's about 7 gold, 5 silver, 2 copper. Per person. Worth of stuff.

[Speaker 4]
7 gold.

[Speaker 3]
5 silver. And 2 pieces of copper. But that's...

But that is in total things. So if you want a potion, that counts to your gold amount. Where's the potion?

The potion's a leaper's elixir. Oh, I don't need the leaper's elixir. I don't even know what they are.

[Speaker 6]
Now, is that a retail price?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that is their proper price. You might not be able to sell it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, it's divided by 64.

[Speaker 5]
It was just a leaper's elixir and a signaling slayer.

[Speaker 3]
This is not divided by 64.

[Speaker 5]
I don't remember there being. Does anyone know better than me on that one?

[Speaker 3]
I thought there was just one.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't take anything from it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no, they got handed around. There's multiple of the thing.

[Speaker 3]
The only thing there are two of are their shortswords.

[Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so Persis is taking the gold.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not going to do it yet until... In case anybody wants to take it. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
I only need the gold. Right now.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Lousy time to take the gold.

[Speaker 3]
You are taking... Did you see the amount of gold you're going to take?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, didn't you say 7 pieces of gold, 5 silver, 2 copper?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, 7 pieces of gold, 5 silver, 2 copper. That's...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I already put that in my inventory. Awesome. Can someone give Merrill 1 silver?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Why is that?

[Speaker 1]
Half the potency or an applied to a weapon would cost 6.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. How do I apply that to my calculations?

[Speaker 2]
Well then, that makes life so much easier.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, yeah. Mm-hmm. It does.

I think he just added the gold directly. That's fine. If we're giving Merrill 1 silver, it's just 7 pieces of gold, 5 pieces of silver for everyone.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so no copper.

[Speaker 3]
No copper.

[Speaker 4]
I'm taking only the copper. Alright. Gulio.

Are we squared? If we are, I'm going to add the run.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, you can go now.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, thanks for the game, guys.

[Speaker 3]
No problem.

[Speaker 4]
Thanks for coming.

[Speaker 6]
Is there anything in here that would indicate some kind of means that would help me refine a ritual for creating undead?

[Speaker 1]
What sort of lore do you have trained?

[Speaker 6]
I have local undead. I have arcane.

[Speaker 3]
What sort of wizard are you?

[Speaker 6]
Necromancer.

[Speaker 5]
Let me... No, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I should have rephrased, but you're using the playtest thing?

[Speaker 6]
No, no, no. So I am a necromancer of the school of Boundary, which is essentially like the undead. But I plan to go the archetype either undead master or the reanimator.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, nice, nice. Okay. Alright, so for the rest of you, are you just taking gold or are you taking equipment?

I don't mind taking equipment if everyone else wants to take gold.

[Speaker 2]
I won't take any equipment or anything like that. So keep that simple.

[Speaker 1]
Could I have a local undead lore check privately? Secretly, sorry?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I think Parasys is going to take the snare and then 4 gold and 5 silver.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Just shift those two. Yeah, there we go.

[Speaker 6]
So do I do blind gem roll? Yes. Yes, please.

[Speaker 3]
Please drag the gold you're taking.

[Speaker 6]
Can I hero point it if it's low?

[Speaker 1]
You don't get to know if it's low. But I can tell you, if you spend a month of downtime, not consecutively, if you spend 30 days, whenever you choose here, researching, you can have access to the ritual create undead.

[Speaker 5]
I'm 5 silver out right now, but I'm not too bothered.

[Speaker 3]
You can take the gold piece, split it, and then put it back.

[Speaker 1]
Fair enough. If everyone just adds the appropriate amount of money to their sheets, I can delete it from the stash. Yeah, that works too, actually.

[Speaker 3]
James, what did you say you wanted to do?

[Speaker 2]
Nothing I can think of.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Treasure-wise, do you just want gold or do you want the elixir or anything?

[Speaker 2]
No, just gold. I already added the 7 gold, 5 silver. Oh, splendid.

That's all I'll take for my share.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so has everyone else taken their shares? I believe so. Alright, I'll just take the remaining short swords, and I'll see if anyone wants them later, and the leaper's elixir.

Let's see, that's 3. I'll do the math for how much gold I actually get. Or silver.

Only one piece of gold for me. It's fine, I'm sure I can find some use for these extra short swords. Was Merrill given that one piece of silver?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I gave her.

[Speaker 3]
Awesome, cool.

[Speaker 1]
So am I allowed to delete all the money from the stash now? Yep.

[Speaker 3]
So everyone is fine and dandy. Nice playing with you, thank you for running, Landi.

[Speaker 1]
That was a lot of fun, I love running, well, kinda. That was so fun. Thank you so much, Merrill.

[Speaker 3]
I really like Smash Buckler. He's fun.

[Speaker 5]
Very, very, very fun.

[Speaker 1]
I also have a Smash Buckler for this game. He's cool.

[Speaker 3]
Understandable. I guess it's a very delightful martial class, you get to do fun things and stab people.

[Speaker 5]
And only having to worry about one good attack is really nice.

[Speaker 7]
Mhm, mhm.

[Speaker 5]
Turns go by really fast. Get your panache, get your finisher, get done.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So how downtime works in this game, actually, I should explain. This campaign is in 1-to-1 time, so as time passes in real life, time will pass in the game. So, basically, if your character is like...

Hypothetically, if you play once a week, that's fine. But your character comes back during the week, spends their downtime here researching the stuff. After four weeks of real-world time pass, you would have the ritual for Create Undead.

Yep. You would know how to do it. That doesn't necessarily mean you would be leveled enough to do it, like, effectively yet, but you would know the ritual, right?

Rituals... Do you know anything about rituals in Pathfinder?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, yeah. I know somewhat.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so basically, anyone can do it if they know the ritual. You'd have to have a check to do it, though. So, Create Undead, you need to be expert in Arcana or Occultism or Religion to do the initial check, so you won't be able to do it until you get to that point.

Yep. The ritual is a great reward for research and stuff. Like, Pathfinder really works well with one-to-one time.

[Speaker 6]
James is a genius.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you guys are geniuses for bringing me in here. I'm trying to... Bar is going to take a hot second to adjust because she doesn't like low-level play, and she's learning in the game.

[Speaker 1]
I did great.

[Speaker 2]
But she did great. Yeah, that's why I'm trying to encourage her. But no, seriously, and thank you guys for being so cooperative when it comes to the grand campaign stuff and the one-to-one time stuff.

The people... It's a rule taken from AD&D 1st Edition that virtually nobody played with because everybody who played back in the 80s was and remains to this day completely illiterate. But...

But... All the people I've explained it to since are like, Oh yeah, no, that makes perfect sense. So...

It makes running downtime and fun downtime events a lot easier.

[Speaker 1]
How do I make it downtime tickets? I just post what I've done in the downtime chat, like...

[Speaker 6]
I've written the downtime chat. If you post in there, they'll kill you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, we will, but... Okay. Cheers.

For example, with my character Rana, I will have her roll downtime. She is working for the Gradvek Thule, investigating haunts. She'll spend a day preparing her downtime and then the next week working.

Here is her Esoteric Law check. She's rolled a 17, which on the Earn Income table. God, I love the Earn Income action.

It's just still there.

[Speaker 5]
I did not think about using Esoterica to earn income.

[Speaker 1]
Working for a necromantic school.

[Speaker 2]
Last session, Rana fucking... Well, the party ran into a bunch of, like, dwarf ghosts, like Ancestral Guardians or whatever. And I was rolling to see if they'd be friendly or not, and we added Rana's check to...

I rolled a 99 out of 100, right, or a percentile there, so it was going to be friendly no matter what. But I added Rana's check to the... I added the Earn Income check to that roll, and we got a bunch of enthusiastically friendly ghosts.

So the party, they had a bunch of ghosts helping them out by, like... They didn't have their own attacks, but they would move around and cause flanking. It was great.

I liked that a lot. Very fun. That's me.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Stuff that you guys do in downtime will come up in sessions, because it's just another hobby.

[Speaker 3]
This is... I think I'll ask it a bit... No, I'll ask it now.

For getting people, like, alliances or group members, basically what I was doing last time around... Should I just throw that away for later and just do basic Earn Income stuff?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can certainly do stuff like that. If you want to set up alliances for the group and stuff, there is a... Remember that the town of Braunloch is...

Is less than a day's travel via boat away.

[Speaker 3]
That's true.

[Speaker 1]
You should go start an alliance at Sierra's Cape.

[Speaker 3]
I probably should.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I...

[Speaker 3]
That's probably just a bunch of diplomacy checks. Sorry, continue? Robin?

[Speaker 5]
I just realized I don't know where on your map we are.

[Speaker 6]
You're right next to the Isle of Dread. Okay. So how many days do we use to get here to do this adventure?

[Speaker 2]
Zero. Everybody starts on the Hidden Bluff at the moment, which is the same island where this happened?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's the same island.

[Speaker 6]
It's like a little walk. And then does our downtime start from the day we create our characters or after our first session? After first session.

[Speaker 3]
After the first session.

[Speaker 6]
That makes sense. That makes total sense.

[Speaker 3]
Otherwise you can just make a bunch of people who are busy collecting Kingdom's Worth.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, yes. Time to make 700 human artists to live in a basement and create beautiful art for me to sell.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to share loot between them without a viable cause.

[Speaker 3]
It's okay, they can die. Replaceable.

[Speaker 5]
I love those in the same basement where they make amazing pieces and then my character goes, kills and eats them and then sells the art.

[Speaker 6]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
There must be more.

[Speaker 6]
You're also very limited with what you can do with crafting based on level, isn't it? Oh yeah. You can't make a 5th level item as a level 1.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you could try, but you'll definitely fail.

[Speaker 2]
It's the one that possesses people and you defeat it by creating poor art. That's pretty sick.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, and you can only do magical crafting like rune transfer if you have magical crafting.

[Speaker 2]
There is a dwarf at base camp that does that. Yes, there is. It's okay that we didn't do it here.

There is like... For new folks, all new folks after you guys are going to be starting with the hidden bluff or whatever mega dungeon is present at the time. It's okay that we didn't do it here because it's the same area.

It's still a dungeon, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. It can just be an offshoot of the hidden bluff, I don't know. Like a spawn.

[Speaker 1]
I just like zombie caves.

[Speaker 3]
They're good.

[Speaker 1]
Honestly, yeah, they're great. I'm so real glad. How to get here?

[Speaker 3]
It fell from space. Yes, the solution to everything. Meteor did it.

[Speaker 2]
Reminds me, I need to fix this calendar so that shows the first round.

[Speaker 3]
Today's session report will be so easy.

[Speaker 1]
I forget how to edit the calendar, I assume it's just in settings.

[Speaker 5]
I hope. I played it up for laughs a little bit, but how was Parasys? I liked it.

It was great overall. I think that's right around where she'll sit then.

[Speaker 4]
backwards, not a quarter speed, not half speed, hits the gas at three quarters as hard as that pedal can go down when she's going out in reverse there and and hit him with the car and and that's you know these are these are the injuries he sustained and then she just left him there and then and I felt as if overall the the overarching theme I got was like yeah she probably accidentally ran him over there.

[Speaker 8]
What did my wife think about the gas pedal testimony Joe?

[Speaker 4]
I mean we don't you don't you don't I actually said after I after I heard after I heard his I I wish that were true I actually I actually spent like nine hours driving on Sunday on Monday

[Speaker 6]
um I so wish that were true yeah I like to kick up my feet so I drive from the passenger seat

[Speaker 4]
the one the one problem I had with his opening and this is I felt more of a fact problem than his issue is you tell me she's drunk I don't know she can form an intent to to kill a guy in that sense and then you want to tell me she's furious at him so she hits the gas really hard and that's you know trying to hurt that her effort in hitting the gas really hard is to try killing him if that's what you're trying to tell me I'll tell you this a woman is behind the wheel of a car and you're telling me that she's furious she is going to slam on that gas pedal and she ain't trying to kill nobody she's just wants to she wants her man to know she's mad and the same way they'll slam a door or whatever and a lot of guys will do this also so you can't tell me that she's mad and the reason we know she's trying the reason we know she's trying to kill him is because she hits the gas that hard I'll tell you right now that that's that that's not just that's not even forget about guilt beyond a reasonable doubt I think the prominence of evidence is kind of thin there to establish that her objective was to try and kill him rather than to make a statement up to him of I'm mad and I'm steamrolling steamrolling out of here okay so that would go ahead and tell

[Speaker 6]
take dissected why no it was so terrible no no no I when I found most interesting this is again I wasn't uh I wasn't going against you here all of what you said was great all what you said was great but when you first described his opening statement you said two things you didn't say them when I asked you what the three most important things were but those were the two things that came to your mind when you weren't thinking about it at all and it was I hit him I hit him I hit him was the first part right and I just find like that is the most devastating part of her case or their case are these admissions that she has over and over and over alleged admissions um and that's where I thought uh that's where I thought Brennan's uh argument or opening argument was the best is is focusing on that I hit him I hit him I hit him and now they've got that established in the first couple witnesses I think that's really bad for her and I think that's going to stick with the jury when they think about what's been going on here the first thing they they're going to think about when they think about the the prosecution's case is I hit him I hit him I hit him and that's

[Speaker 2]
what empire game flow of conversation that's a vampire in it I modified it to be good yeah I uh

[Speaker 3]
downloaded a I love the vampire mods and stuff but I also downloaded a vampire mod for uh fallout 4 it's so broken because it has it has not been updated in years so it's so broken still very

[Speaker 2]
fun though how you doing James good answer how do you talking now nothing I don't want him to think

[Speaker 1]
his mic was broken before when it wasn't it's it's it's good now right it's fine

[Speaker 2]
yes it's good I can hear you we're good we're here we're on time that's not here so me and progress are all just around three characters

[Speaker 1]
totally fair

[Speaker 2]
I'm happy to bring a second character though if needed

[Speaker 1]
are we back yet from our five-day in-game jail no that is your time jail ends tomorrow I believe

[Speaker 2]
oh that's a different which time jail was that caravan escort arrives back to

[Speaker 1]
bronlock by horse is tomorrow oh right yeah it's not sunday yet uh

[Speaker 2]
and sucks for whoever agreed to go on that adventure

[Speaker 3]
that's okay I can definitely bring Kibi and if I have to bring a second I can bring Susudio because I do not want to play two spell casters I can I can pick her ancestry and not ancestry I can pick her feet next time at some other point I'm gonna just fuck around with Susudio

[Speaker 1]
lindy is there anything on this map that you need uh

[Speaker 2]
continued or maintained nope this maps if you want to use it you can have it um otherwise you

[Speaker 1]
can just delete it well no you don't have to delete anything I love any map that you add is like something I can use in the future so fuck yeah but yeah yeah that's I always have

[Speaker 2]
I love having a peek through everyone else's maps to see if there's anything I can borrow if like

[Speaker 1]
random encounter or something like that eventually there's going I've been building up this store of um of like random random table generators for things like dungeons and like they're they're basically geomorphs for like runes and things like that um so you guys will be able to if if anybody is running a dungeon or doing anything that requires you know sudden use of I don't know you're out in the wilderness and you find a a tomb down there you need to start overlaying a bunch of dungeon tiles on top of the forest map or whatever have you then then you can do so just directly this is so annoying

[Speaker 3]
I want my headset to be here already I can only hear you out of one ear I hate this

[Speaker 1]
that is that is rough all right so so you two both you two should both bring uh multiple characters I am going to not have a remove member remove number all right Ferguson who are you bringing I only

[Speaker 3]
have Marshall characters to bring so I have uh Kibi yeah I only have Kibi and Susudio what about your bro oh my god I totally could play him he doesn't have like any equipment and he's kind of over encumbered with alcohol unless I can unless I can just go ahead and sell that as a downtime thing yeah yeah I think we need to get started

[Speaker 1]
with the fight right now but you do have to get started with the fight because now

[Speaker 2]
nine spring uh might bring Susudio I think uh so I'll bring Nova and Rana

[Speaker 1]
and I just drag them up into the party yeah everybody go ahead and drag yourselves into the party I do not have permission what oh okay I see what happened so I read so I update it to like uh the final version of like v12 is the ashes of the server down it literally just shut down because I have to turn back on because I did a server update through foundry server so it's going to take a moment to get back online it's very funny and it does that an hour later but I didn't know the timing would be

[Speaker 3]
so perfect I'm gonna try balloon and see if that works hold on I'm gonna unplug my headset okay okay can am I am I able to be heard yeah I can hear you a bit further it sounds like you're a bit further from the mic now okay all right but can you hear me like good decent

[Speaker 1]
it's it's not super decent it's uh it sounds like whatever bluetooth is using whenever bluetooth is acting as audio output and audio input it I think it switches from like stereo to something called hands-free which is like lower quality

[Speaker 3]
um yeah let me fix that

[Speaker 1]
usually change it by just switching your input to something that's not your bluetooth

[Speaker 3]
how do I even turn down the fucking cotton advanced sound properties please all right speak good god why is it so loud

[Speaker 1]
that's the other thing it does is it's uh not terribly cooperative when it comes to actually turning down your audio or letting you adjust it this hurts my poor ears

[Speaker 3]
not quite as bad as getting screamed at by a bird but not great no well those birds being mean to you again the bird is always mean he just gets mad sometimes and screams I did find out today that he likes to play um fruit ninja on my phone

[Speaker 5]
now knowing some birds does he actually play fruit injure does he watch you yes

[Speaker 3]
no no no he plays it like he actually goes for the individual

[Speaker 5]
crazy good old birds

[Speaker 1]
I am I am go ahead and drag yourselves to the party sheet

[Speaker 2]
how many characters were you expecting for this

[Speaker 1]
any it's um I don't care

[Speaker 2]
all right in my case I'll drag all four of mine yeah double cat characters double

[Speaker 5]
that's up to the that's up to the other the other people at the table not me

[Speaker 3]
all right yes I think you should answer if you open two they give us six players

[Speaker 5]
double the chance for a complete why

[Speaker 2]
we just get no xp because of how many characters there are that's great yeah we're gonna have like 16 party members and we're gonna be earning 10 xp per

[Speaker 1]
encounter brilliant we'll just we'll just skip the part where you actually do the encounter and

[Speaker 3]
then I'll uh I'll just kind of wait we're gonna drag cubes into the party and then let me make sure this video doesn't have art yet so just pretend that he's a frog um it's the albino frog isn't he yeah I did it did I you know what I'm just bringing kiwi because susudio is not even done can he just join in a little bit later sure

[Speaker 1]
I don't mind that at all where the fuck is my where are you in my feast area what the fuck

[Speaker 2]
there is one point of xp difference between nova and rana's next step to the next levels nova's at 752 and rana's at 753 it's just that poor rana is a level behind nova

[Speaker 1]
where the fucking gremlins what the fuck what looking for my gremlins and uh maybe they're part of like an adventure path no they're in monster core so oh I see because I'm searching up gremlin which is a family and not the oh

[Speaker 2]
I fucked up we fighting pug wampies I love pug wampies they're just dog-faced gremlins I just I don't know if all gremlins have an unlock aura but uh I know they do unlock aura is nasty kill parties the final boss of strength of thousands has a really big one and one of my players is playing a fighter when you're meant to be playing majors so they were relying on attack rolls so they're doing all the disadvantage it sucked for them they're like yeah that was like one of the least fights I've ever played in it's like well you should have built a character for the

[Speaker 1]
play oops all right go ahead and there's an error saving changes fuck you there we go go ahead and drop yourselves right in smack in the middle of the map

[Speaker 2]
of the caravan one yes please okay

[Speaker 3]
here you go oh god we only have there's only three of us

[Speaker 5]
that's what I said we can bring double characters

[Speaker 3]
and none of mine are ready I mean are you sure we can't just in-game wait like an extra day and let our characters come back technically you could should we can we do that because then charis can come

[Speaker 1]
just means you're waiting an extra day I really though you should like invest in like you know your poor brother not getting any xp there yeah um he's he's a little bit he's over encumbered um he doesn't have to take the booze with him okay

[Speaker 3]
um could I technically just put them in the party stash and then grab them afterwards

[Speaker 1]
yeah that's fine because it might make sure that you were selling them last downtime anyways

[Speaker 2]
yeah oh my god hold on in the stash we can resolve that after yeah that's why I'm just

[Speaker 1]
starting with the with the uh with the combat so we're like all frontline so far

[Speaker 3]
well we're all gonna die

[Speaker 2]
h has healing we'll be fine

[Speaker 5]
I remember h is taking the store the wrong way

[Speaker 2]
you can delete the numbering around the wagons if it bothers you as well oh that's fine

[Speaker 1]
let me get one last thing here you guys can position yourselves however you want you could also choose an exploration activity that you were taking beforehand

[Speaker 2]
do we know we're being attacked by gremlins or is this like any inclination that we will be fighting gremlins or is this just a this is random encounter this is just a random encounter

[Speaker 1]
so you wouldn't have had any yeah recall knowledge is about yeah yeah we're doing something that would have clued you off which just likes when we notice yeah that's a that one to have rana

[Speaker 3]
doesn't have anything useful what can he be do other than just like keep watch

[Speaker 2]
keeping watch is good so we don't get ambushed uh that um it means they won't be unnoticed when the fight starts if you roll a perception against the stealth dc which i do like that gm doesn't need to roll for shit it's all just dcs if it's not clear typically a dc is like 10 plus the skill so for example rana has plus five to do perception so her perception dc would be 15. we have our weapons ready

[Speaker 1]
yes all right and then you said i have to you were talking about how i have to do something i

[Speaker 2]
wasn't listening uh not really if they're hiding i'll roll stealth uh initiative oh no they're not uh but then uh it's just perception initiatives for everyone else but hooch i think we all have um a plus one circumstance bonus from scouting

[Speaker 3]
i think okay never mind so if they roll initiative better than hooch's um

[Speaker 2]
stealth initiative a hooch will be not hidden for any of them is from what i understand of stealth rules two zero point we all should have one hero point

[Speaker 1]
so restart the session with one hero point that's a lot of initiative right what is it so i can definitely use the airplane so they are going on let's see here they're approaching the caravan they trip over a basically trip over the tail of a large animal which spooks and fucking starts running screaming along the trail next to your caravan and she goes the other way so that's what alerted everybody they are quite a distance off when they actually first begin i willed for encounter distance there we go so this little guy just spent all three of his actions running up this way as is this little guy

[Speaker 5]
just uh so with the blowgun dart this is their thin light darts to please hollow

[Speaker 1]
hey hey as a question in the chat sorry because nova's up well if you ask the question i was gonna use it like look at both

[Speaker 2]
so her first action she'll use her style at transformation and become super nova i do not have a unique token for that yet um she can um straight up here and squeeze between the caravans i think and uh smack this one do they look hostile oh yeah easy no morality i'm gonna hit it with nova's iconic weapon star soul uh she missed that's her turn okay um sorry would have kiwi used her free action on initiative to rage yes uh let's just a little bit up in chat

[Speaker 3]
i don't know if i needed to do that okay um oh also i have i think i can just get rid of that okay um let's see where the nearest motherfucker is to me that's hooch um which is friendly does it tell me how far i can go what is her speed where do i see speed

[Speaker 2]
uh if you're looking at your your character part their speeds and then land above like your strength modifier where if i look where so you double click your um token to get your character sheet up and then uh for the select the tab that has character so like it's got all of your race and stuff just to put your strength modifiers you've got your speeds okay 25 feet thank you i think i blocked you my bad i don't think you can walk through the wagon wait is the wagon there

[Speaker 3]
okay um well in that case i will just go yeah i'll just go around we'll pretend i went around here uh and then i will target this guy actions strike 18 damage uh so that was dead those reactions all right

[Speaker 1]
any other characters that you're adding to the combat by the way kiwi um maybe in a different round okay we'll see yeah you can one of them can be sleeping in the

[Speaker 3]
or he just comes out of the forest like whoa what's going on here

[Speaker 1]
where is it this one all right you guys helpfully left cover here i am going to roll two dice only one of which hits and it's turn this guy is going to and all three actions to run up this guy will also spend all three actions to run up they have like a 20 foot speed oh there we go oh well you only move 55 feet so

[Speaker 2]
oh if he had a 25 foot speed he would have been able to get there and hit me

[Speaker 1]
it's all yeah but i gotta move over to they have a low speed they do have a little bit this one is gonna move up and gonna do the i'm sure i'll let him move up just a little bit further yeah there you go he's got a dark chick magnificent and then we come to rana

[Speaker 2]
rana is going to use her exploited vulnerability on i think if i target him and then click it it should do it oh yeah and that is once per round i can try that so she'll send a spec an action striding up and we'll smack them oh that was bad oh the failure still applies an effect which did automatically go on the token beautiful oh yeah that's her turn there's a guy oh he looks more dangerous when this fight's done before you automatically apply xp i do have a question but it can wait

[Speaker 1]
sure oh i see oh shit that one's also dead fucking god damn it no no i want to come on now yeah it's okay my my attack briefly uh just disappeared which is a little a little weird i don't really know what's going on there hey uh and did that have the poison you pinged on it no okay only because it doesn't say what kind of poison

[Speaker 2]
it's not pleasing let's look at huh anyways that's his turn apparently out of venom isn't a thing but black out of venom is but that doesn't look like the item description yeah oh yeah that is the one i oh no that's what um yeah that's what i found what hooch is posted but uh i digress what's hooch gonna do um

[Speaker 5]
so i'm gonna run up here and i'm gonna target this guy and then i'm going to do it two bombs quick acne oh yeah i think i did that right

[Speaker 1]
i have to splash this guy next to him as well for one damage wait why did he only take no he did take the down okay that's good and the splash damage would hit that guy all right when you're when you're pressing the button over and over again it doesn't let me

[Speaker 2]
that was me pinging mb i'm gonna keep pinging

[Speaker 5]
all right i think that one and then i'm gonna do the map oh hey crit nice all right i think

[Speaker 3]
i think susudio is addable now uh i think i'm gonna bring susudio in very good he does not have a character token apologies i i can't seem to figure out the character token stuff

[Speaker 1]
so cannot be bothered with it right now nope that did not work ah there we go

[Speaker 5]
i'll avert the combat if you don't mind but i think he's still locked for another day you can find them on the way back home and it's hot

[Speaker 2]
oh you posted the question there um the questions like that posted in the foundry chat so i can see it i don't check the or the text channel that goes with the voice channel that often sorry sorry or the voiceover flow channel so i don't miss it um i'll look up wait and i'm not sure

[Speaker 5]
if you didn't hear me or not but that's my turn i think james is muted if you're talking

[Speaker 1]
yep i was muted for a second i was just finishing something up here we go ah it's not gonna let me do that then all right that's kind of annoying i'm just gonna skip that guy's turn

[Speaker 3]
um do you want me to add susudio to the map and do um are we just initiative okay i will just drag him here and roll initiative

[Speaker 1]
oh wow okay then two darts at keebs was i also able to bring that for two misses all right that is the end of theirs oh hey susunio

[Speaker 3]
yes okay well he will go around here i think here if i go am i yeah he's smaller i think he can fit between the thing and that

[Speaker 1]
um would that do flanking for this guy yes in fact it would probably be applied automatically as far as i know yep his ac should be lowered for the attack okay oh hold on

[Speaker 3]
how would i do i gotta scroll all the way down good lord i hit okay oh okay uh well i can i can go again you know what i'm gonna bite this motherfucker oh it missed

[Speaker 1]
okay that's my go still got up with one that's good

[Speaker 3]
yeah i can have the life of me figure out how to put a token in

[Speaker 1]
i didn't load anything onto the darts um were you also able to bring rare yeah yeah no if you want to bring a bear you can that's still a day's travel away though okay all right so no all right and you said that you did do three attacks or you only did one or two i think that's stride attack attack oh i mean if you want to yeah no that's fine it's fine complicated things why am i being silly oh hey it's this guy uh he's gonna go after after kibi because kibi is flight and at last i can flank

[Speaker 3]
yes oh god why it would have why have you done this

[Speaker 1]
and i get do i get vengeful anger no i don't because you haven't damaged him previously i don't think

[Speaker 3]
god damn it uh does this do anything

[Speaker 1]
uh that's an action that you have to take it looks like okay that fucks with their saving throws here's what it does all right the other two attacks go damage another two damage final attack critical miss my god all right

[Speaker 3]
should i do that um okay let me let me fuck with all that damage okay so that's

[Speaker 2]
that's the two damage is that doubled or is that is that the correct dimension that was the correct yeah yeah

[Speaker 1]
it's two to six minus two and i got four

[Speaker 3]
and apply apply damage how do i why is it not letting me apply damage

[Speaker 2]
fuck i'm gonna start rolling uh nova's gonna hit the guy next to him i'm pretty sure this is gonna kill him well and surely how much damage does he take so i can heal for half of it with my second action oh and that is half the damage dealt so that oh it doesn't say damage taken it says damage dealt so i assume it would be half of what i rolled yeah which is enough to top me up easily that moves my uh divine spark to my scar and with my last action i will hit uh this guy with reach so i can try and stop them flanking kibbi that is the end of my time excellent

[Speaker 1]
kibbi your your ghost your ghost hammer axe thing the retribution axe there it is yes extra damage against this guy because he attacked you it's changed ugly gremlin face uh below okay the guy that i've already cool yeah it's whoever all right i got that wrong but this guy yes which guy that hits

[Speaker 3]
um that kills nice kibbi's gonna turn to this guy um damn that's real funny you have a third action uh and i have i think i have yes i have a third um

[Speaker 1]
um okay thanks kibbi uh this guy is going to turn to hooch i know attack three times in the dark just a dot battle that's me hey yeah i have one vengeful anger plus two status bonus damage how do i add that there you go that's that's the easy method all right that is yes turn i'm now two oh this guy i didn't realize he was still alive all right we're gonna do the

[Speaker 2]
same exact thing do they take the fire damage it automatically did it

[Speaker 3]
where is that okay no that's not what we're doing

[Speaker 1]
that is there so we come now to rama all right that guy's dead he died from his persistent damage

[Speaker 2]
her honor will do her exploit vulnerability on this little guy so that should um whoops that's the feature not the ability i need the macro

[Speaker 3]
i did it guys i figured it out my brain grew a wrinkle and i did it

[Speaker 2]
so that means i'll be hitting him with cold iron which run all stride forward uh up to flanking she will target him and attack they crit very nice and so he should have a weakness too to that but it's hard to tell because he died did in the damage that he took does it say he had a weakness

[Speaker 1]
thing that's as weak to cold iron plus two awesome uh which is why you killed him because

[Speaker 2]
he is exactly 19 hit points wait okay uh that's my turn

[Speaker 5]
so i'm going to do another quick alchemy and sorry just quickly ruling 30s that'll be so i'll go up to here and then i'll target this guy with a firebomb if i can oops nope that didn't work right how do i equip an item from my inventory ah there it is so uh bomber train let's be draw and throw at the same time except first one oh so it's just the one splash uh correctness doesn't get splash uh i'm gonna go throw this one and in which case i'm going to drop my phone and then i'll throw it at the map penalty um hit and that is my turn

[Speaker 1]
go all right so hold on a second who's getting targeted by that uh this smaller guy all right and is there anybody else oh that one is a splash target takes a splash yeah you can set a splash target by clicking the little uh splash target icon while you have uh somebody teed damsayer and splash there yeah there we go great so why i haven't teed i do what i do never mind this one and over here's off balance

[Speaker 2]
i love the studio's picture thank you thank you that is the turn

[Speaker 5]
hey oh so close to a crit

[Speaker 1]
oh all right that is let's move the dead guy over there

[Speaker 2]
loading them up in the wagon to take home for dissection

[Speaker 1]
um let's try to wait when i try to range dart keeby all right well i i did so what have you done to keeving excuse me tried to hit her with a range dart for some reason oh you did it there you go there's your two damn

[Speaker 3]
and ow that tickles

[Speaker 1]
and the axe now shapes its face to be that guy to your right and so on is also going to he's just so bad it's in a funny way though all right it's the studio

[Speaker 7]
okay

[Speaker 3]
um i don't fully understand i don't fully understand do i all right i'm going to tag this in chat do i have to be in water or no you enter that's just a stance that's the water trait

[Speaker 2]
but uh it has water properties so you're acting like water so you can only enter a stance in combat so you spend the action like you have and it should be um

[Speaker 1]
something you can drag onto your this is exciting

[Speaker 2]
okay i'm not sure there should be you can yeah that applies it to your character now so the attacks from that will show up in your action list of attacks

[Speaker 1]
so it's like this little toggle that sets up that tells you hey you get to use these extra

[Speaker 3]
actions now yep i'm gonna get rid of it really quickly and then redo it just because i need to see what it is where it is exactly um okay that wait hmm i see it cool did it play that twice it doesn't matter we're here we're clear and we're full of existential fear let's go

[Speaker 1]
that hits it just barely hits perfect perfect

[Speaker 3]
uh so that's that's all my actions uh you should have one more no i moved and then i entered the state and then i hit

[Speaker 2]
and then okay bring us to nova uh i hit this guy between uh super nova and kiwi killing this man um most likely just straight up here and hit this guy uh yeah with a second attack with a mess

[Speaker 1]
me all right kiwi

[Speaker 3]
kiwi smash yeah kiwi smash wait kiwi kiwi does not need to smash is everyone dead

[Speaker 1]
two other targets there's um and they're both this way

[Speaker 3]
okay i can go there and there's a yeah okay kiwi smash and that'll be oh okay kiwi don't smash kiwi hit the ground cool

[Speaker 2]
nova did exactly the same thing all right how do i end my turn

[Speaker 1]
oh there's a button track huh yeah you have to beg try to hit no all right that didn't work um so instead i'm gonna try to dart yeah and what oh yeah just flick that on yeah sweet and then that misses there you go that's the end of his turn time to see what happens oh that's a delay dialogue

[Speaker 2]
no arana's going to stride to here she's now flanking with uh never with her second action she's going to kill me i'll show you where the loot is let's do the demoralize and he's now frightened if he's going to surrender arana won't kill him what you say

[Speaker 1]
please do it's um we we were coming to get supplies for for we're coming to get supplies help spay lore try to establish an alliance with the false widow and um and she said no but she would give us some some goods to make the job easier you know i i could show you yes you should yeah yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's right this way i'm just going to end the encounter

[Speaker 2]
and before i apply the experience yes um so uh there are rules in pathfinder for like this is for like long-term campaigns where everyone's playing the same character every session that if a character is behind in level that they would receive double xp if the encounter was say like a level two encounter in their level one but i don't i think the game should automatically calculate xp based on what level we all are anyway so i don't think i'm just saying i don't think you should do it for this but uh because i think we would get less xp if rana was level two for example so i think that evens it out enough i i think double xp is too much for i'm not super opposed

[Speaker 1]
it's um show me the if you tag the the rule especially i'll find that level disparities get like larger because they don't see an option to do it in here um yes there's nothing

[Speaker 2]
to do it in the automation i will post this in the flow channel right now self i can add for

[Speaker 1]
instance i can make susudio uh i could boost the studios but i don't know if that's

[Speaker 2]
because uh basically the game expects you to select a party level when determining the xp budget for the encounter so you choose the level the best represents the party and if uh so like if it's if it was just nova that was level three and everyone else was level one you would just have a level one encounter but like if it's one level one character and like the rest of level three you'd probably want to give them double uh party members who are behind the party level game double xp because then people above get after them no it doesn't say that anyway so it's just because the yeah like um the lessening xp for characters that are ahead will get reflected in the xp budget so like say if it's like um that didn't make sense to me um and it's not your fault

[Speaker 1]
i'm probably just not understanding it correctly so it's not it only considers if you're behind whether xp needs to be doubled it doesn't no no that i get it's um but you keep saying that like the xp system here is if i if i give susudio extra experience then it's going to give everybody

[Speaker 2]
else less no no i'm not not if you apply it after the fact in the automation um i think

[Speaker 1]
that would be doing it for a level two encounter but i don't know for sure

[Speaker 2]
so when you do you have the xp um being given out without that screen it says it's going to be 156 yeah so i still have that everyone okay you would just have to double that manually if it's a level two encounter but if if you don't think it was a level two encounter then just hit assign xp of

[Speaker 1]
yeah i'll hit auto assign and then for the next level two encounter i'll do that

[Speaker 2]
yeah like yeah um that's really up to you

[Speaker 1]
because i do want to use that for especially when there's bigger disparities and like level three and level one like okay that level one should have their xp doubled

[Speaker 2]
okay very good so close to level three basically what i was trying to say before though if nova was level three for a level two encounter it would make your level two encounter worth less xp overall which is the um downside to having higher level characters coming on low tier adventures is nobody earns anything from it well unless it's a level three of course then everyone's getting doubled yeah for the lower characters which is good yeah plus level three makes things difficult it's like if nova just hangs around at the hidden bluff waiting for new players to join so i'm like yeah it's my level five character for your level one dungeon it's just gonna make everyone miserable but if you survive oh what a payday well if the level ones band together and kill nova then yeah they will get xp but but if if it's a level five encounter that all the level ones are coming on yeah they're gonna be crazy after that you'd probably want to like quadruple xp or something i don't i don't know

[Speaker 1]
yeah well i'd add additional xp for like something you know all right i am going to go use the restroom i will be a hot second so take like a 10 minute break i i really liked opening with combat do you guys like opening with combat i feel like i should do this yes yeah it only gets you know it takes us an hour to start anyways but with this i could just be like monsters go and then i can finish up writing up this nice little note thing

[Speaker 2]
all right is this session after 10 minutes no i was looking in the calendar and it's great how much stuff has happened

[Speaker 1]
it's fucking crazy i love it all right

[Speaker 6]
focusing on that i hit him i hit him i hit him and now they've got that established in the first couple witnesses i think that's really bad for her and i think that's going to stick with the jury when they think about what's been going on here the first thing they're going to think about when they think about the the prosecution's case is i hit him i hit him i hit him and that's what in your natural flow of conversation that's what you hinted at and i love that i was so annoyed though that you didn't get back there when i asked you the three most important things right but um but the my main problem with his opening argument is that okay he establishes that that's a big part of it he establishes the forensics i do agree with you that that's really really critical but i i don't get the story out of him at all it felt like it was i have this piece and this piece and this piece and this piece but i'm not seeing the picture when the puzzle's put together and and that was my my main problem like you're losing me i don't know why any of this is going to matter and you haven't you haven't built an arc that tells me why it's going to matter okay through it and hanks or not hanks uh jackson's opening statement it starts off strong like he flat out he's just like this didn't happen and then he goes through why you're going to hear that this didn't happen uh and all the problems with it and i thought that his narrative was better as like and like you said by the time jackson's done you're like no this beyond reasonable doubt no way did they get there uh at this point yeah i mean the

[Speaker 4]
it was so effective when i was trying to explain to lady logic why i was on day one i started really enjoying this case is i went over to her and i said this is the opening and i went through the opening far more thoroughly than i just did now and i'm like they're talking about they got his dna on the on the back of the car they've got broken her broken taillight all around his body there when he when you first hear him explain that you're like all right her broken taillight is all around his body how the hell could that not be that he hit her and then you find alan jackson coming up there saying this never happened oh you're gonna remember the name michael proctor because he did such a bad job in this investigation that he they had to fire him for his work on this case that's how bad it was and he took possession of that car a couple hours before telling anyone he had possession of it and then after they've done a search once twice and on the third time all of a sudden after he gets the car boom now we have fragments from her tail light all around his body i'm like oh my god this is crazy this is that's when i that's when i fell in love with this case it was during alan jackson's opening and then we had that first witness that came out there and and when he was being impeached i was like this this case is gonna be crazy but and i do think that this is a really fun case i'm looking forward to the next six weeks rather than dreading day by day which is which is awesome but the point of getting at yeah i'm not saying that she's guilty i don't and i'll tell you i don't understand how his dna would get on there i mean if he's wearing clothing i don't understand what the hell is happening here look wait so this is girlfriend's

[Speaker 6]
car yeah if you want to understand how his dna like oh yeah he could have opened the trunk yeah he could have gets everywhere yeah if you own something or interacting with it uh relatively frequently dna is going to get everywhere the the trick with dna is always are they swabbing the right place did they happen to find a spot where dna has uh has made it and been preserved

[Speaker 4]
at that at that i don't even understand how his dna would get in the car in the cold winter if

[Speaker 6]
if it's that from a means dna doesn't like bundle up and stay in for the winter like it still gets

[Speaker 4]
on stuff you asked you asked a great question this is something else that when i was snapping you i caught like i think the best of your coverage perhaps so if not you guys have been killing it when you made the point as far as the taillight smashing outwards rather than inwards which is something i hadn't personally thought of but that the idea that it would smash outwards into him rather than his head pushing it inward and then it would just sort of like stay there you know they wouldn't all come shattering out right then and there it doesn't that's hard to understand how that would happen and does make it seem more like someone sprinkled those pieces around his body it's like a bomb like an i.e.d taillight yeah i thought that was a great i thought that was a great point that i had i myself had not come up with yeah yeah i want to see how they

[Speaker 6]
how the state tries to get a you know the forensic recreation to show me all these lacerations the only thing i can think is that on his uh up near his deltoid the the upper arm you have these big horizontal gouges and to me that's the closest i can get to saying all right if i see a jagged edge of a taillight and if it happens to catch the arm just right and it can gouge across horizontally that makes sense like what a couple first one laceration but that's a lot yeah that's a laceration that is not shards like everywhere right this this peppering of the arm it looks like he tried to kidnap rambo's daughter or something and as and as andrew has pointed out

[Speaker 4]
far broader range than than what than the than the size of the taillight i mean it just it's 18 inches across across there's lacerations across like 18 inches and that taillight looks far smaller than i don't know but that it's spreading out throughout his arm i agree that and also real let's face it there's no bruise other than his the only bruising he got from getting hit by a car not on his leg not his hip not on his not his chest the only bruise is like what he's leaning head first into he's leaning head first and arm first into like this into the into the driveway where she what is happening there what position bodily position could he be in that he gets no injury no bruising at all anywhere from toe from from toe all the way up to to armpit on his torso and only on his arm and on his head i don't understand how any person has ever been hit by a car that way unless they were you know laying across a train track or something like that you know and laying across a road like that that's the only way that would happen

[Speaker 6]
okay you say that and i i 100 agree but i've also watched dash cam videos from india and i know that no matter what you think can't happen it has happened in india it has been caught on camera several times so i'm i'm willing to entertain the theory i just don't i don't see it but i can be shown but i'm gonna need it to be done with some kind of bicycle in the background i'm gonna need a train going by with too many people on it right uh and that's the street this wide exactly but that's like my my point is i know that uh i can't see it i can't see it at all that doesn't mean it didn't happen though the unlikely happens all the time the unlikely happens in catastrophic ways uh with with more frequency than we want to admit it's just unlikely for that situation but a whole lot of shit's going on in the world all the time so there's

[Speaker 4]
always opportunities um but yeah i killed him that alan jackson like blew my mind with is that snowplow guy saying that he went by there three o'clock in the morning there's nobody there it's like wait what the hell what they it's like the vanishing body between that wasn't there at two two three o'clock in the morning and that was you know was there when she leaves it and it's back there again at six o'clock in the morning to me i'm just like we got we got like this is a real mystery this is like a whodunit and you got to get proof beyond a reasonable doubt they're gonna have a hard time it's a hard it's a hard one if not for the fact that she opened her

[Speaker 6]
mouth you know so what do you guys what do you guys think now i think the popular opinion or a popular opinion out there is is the at least some level of conspiracy and cover up of this not necessarily an intentional murder but uh cover up of the death however it was caused by the people at the party um and then of course pinning it on karen reid they're all cops there's problems with the investigation so the rumors of conspiracy obviously uh are there right do you think it's wise for the defense to make a try to build a conspiracy argument or is it like more directly or should they just uh should they just aim for reasonable doubt and not go for the conspiracy what because you don't have to present the the thing that may have happened and that can cause a lot of trouble for you if you try and can't really sell it so what do you what do you

[Speaker 8]
do in this case do you go for the conspiracy well i think a lot of this you know conspiracy is a strong word right did all these people sit around the table and orchestrate all this i mean that's probably not what happened for all these people um but are all these people friends with each other do they socialize do they go to the high school junior prom together i mean and and once they do that do we have this contamination of memories and people want to reinforce their friends perceptions of what happened and and so you end up with with it's almost like a a subplot conspiracy as opposed to an active conspiracy it's an incidental conspiracy i mean karen reid could be completely guilty right she hit this guy with her car drove home these people don't know anything more than they know now about it but they would still be contaminating each other's memories right and a lot of the most damaging testimony is they're recounting things that are not their personal memories but things that were kind of inserted into their minds because of recollections that other people said they had and those things are damaging the defense still has to address the damaging testimony is it credible is it contamination is this real did you actually hear this and then people have to say well no i didn't actually hear it right like

[Speaker 4]
kerry roberts right when she recreated everything with jenny mccabe and wrote it down but you can't

[Speaker 8]
let that stuff stay in front of the jury as if it's unimpeached yeah so um i tried to talk about

[Speaker 6]
this in my in my own case because they're uh the the word conspiracy just means people acting in in concert towards a particular end it doesn't mean that they set out to do it necessarily conspiracies manifest at different times my case was not a conspiracy against me but there there are certain things that happen that can uh where people do act in concert for a purpose and they have a conspiratorial purpose even it it doesn't mean that they are framing someone or whatever but how something can be handled can be this is not from the government i'm not talking about government in my case people i'm just referring back to a prior conversation that i but the other thing you have and this is where i think people uh this applies in all contexts and people undervalue how little needs to be done to fuck someone over completely intentionally or unintentionally a government worker missing something by accident can uh can be the difference between someone going to prison forever and not going to prison at all and in the same way like uh andrew's talking about these incidental conversations that you have with your high school classmates your co-workers in some cases your your co-workers wives are getting together you know that those types of conversations create this and it doesn't take much uh to to really hose someone over even when uh when everything's legitimate or sorry where karen reid is completely innocent and uh no one interfered with john o'keefe on his own like maybe just dying outside who knows meteor hits him for example um and there could be no i would explain the lacerations better than the car exactly but um but it it really doesn't take much i don't know that that's why uh i'm i'm curious on if they should go for the can try to convince the jury that there's a conspiracy of information maybe that's a better way to say it a conspiracy

[Speaker 4]
of information so for example i when you were saying that just now and what branca was saying imagine like you there is a guy cop who screws something up and another cop sees that he screwed it up but you really can't unspill that milk so you would basically be like all right i don't i don't want jason to get in trouble here so you know we're friends for the last 30 years i'm just going to help cover that up that he screwed that part up cover it up not that i want to see karen reid go to prison i don't care about that i'm not looking to get her i don't i don't have an anti-karen reid bias i'm just trying to protect my friend here who from the embarrassment of having this screw-up being called to light so they'll start to cover up for each other in that sort of way and and it ends up if you're cynical you can look at it and say like they all want to see karen fry you know but that's not the that's not the motivation the motivation is there's a screw-up which is followed up by you've been like oh i want to protect this person from facing repercussions for that screw-up not i want to punish karen reid for something especially if

[Speaker 8]
they genuinely believe she's guilty right they don't have to have the evidence they don't need proof beyond a reasonable doubt they just conclude he killed she killed john well then it doesn't matter what they make up about her or what they pretend they knew because it's all in a good cause

[Speaker 4]
we're getting justice done by by law we're lying to get justice done we're putting this together to make sure that she actually you know that our friend see and and his family see justice get done

[Speaker 6]
this is a plot summary of every detective show on in on the planet it's like yeah we well we have to look over the the procedures and protocols that are there to protect rights because we know the guy's guilty we just got to find the way to get there so we can arrest the

[Speaker 8]
guy and prove it right everybody knows she's guilty well that's what they believe and then everything's fair game and then you feel like you're not being bad you feel like you're the more

[Speaker 4]
you're you're acting on behalf of morality right i mean you feel as if you're you're helping make the world a better place by by by telling this lie because you're you're ultimately seeing justice get done once you reach that conclusion and we've just summarized the wire

[Speaker 6]
thanks joe for explaining mcnulty to us

[Speaker 4]
nobody saw the wire actually it's really good the first episode was so was i got a half half hour into the first episode i was just like this is so slow it was the first half hour was just like and and i don't remember what happened

[Speaker 6]
but yeah i love the first the first scene though the first like five minutes is just uh it's the

[Speaker 4]
funniest conversation i don't remember it i don't remember i just remember like i was like a half hour in and i was just like one second be right back yeah anyway so yeah so i we were talking about the effectiveness of counsel and things of that nature what do you think of what do you think

[Speaker 8]
of the state prosecutors so far uh i mean they're methodical they're stepping through what their argument is i don't see them making uh big mistakes they're they're you know they tend to overreach like prosecutors tend to do you know make more out of their evidence than it actually is but that's that's to be expected uh you know they they believe she's guilty they're trying to prove a of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt uh you know they're always kind of scuzzy so i mean when people say all these prosecutors are horrible things sometimes that's true sometimes they're really bad sometimes they're you know binger bad i'm not seeing that level here i'm seeing a pretty pretty typical prosecutors taking what they can get you know it is an adversarial process the defense is supposed to check these guys when they're overreaching too much and of course the judge is supposed to be there to enforce all that i don't have a problem i think they're very low you know they're low energy they're no alan jackson um which is why they're public prosecutors and alan jackson's you know makes a lot of money doing what he does right uh the uh uh ian eddie is that the other guy the local bank counsel he's good too i like him

[Speaker 4]
you know i'm not sure it's united or ian eddie but yeah um he pronounces it you know he pronounced it united when he was when he addressed the jury today so but whatever yeah you know that's what

[Speaker 8]
it is david you know he's good uh elizabeth little we heard for the first time today i i mean i i didn't hear much from her she sounds like she's asking questions off a piece of paper that someone gave to her uh she comes across you know she's new someone said eight years i mean eight years can be kind of i mean i guess it depends on what she's been doing right a lot of lawyers or 20 years are never in a courtroom so um but anyway so i i don't i i wasn't super impressed by her but maybe that's uh appropriate for where she's at i don't know then there's that guy uh robert alessi who who strikes me like if elon musk became a criminal defense attorney kind of on the spectrum really you know uh kind of bothersomely loud like why is he so loud all the time it's like he's always yelling at the judge all the time i'm like i mean he throws in words like fort with and post haste and in a way that you know if i ever came across like a fake lawyer in a courtroom i'd expect him to behaving a lot like robert alessi not that i'm saying he's a fake lawyer but uh it's just kind of an odd way of presenting himself in a courtroom um and i don't know i don't know what to say about them and then of course is the last lawyer who's not really a lawyer here but i guess she's kind of advising the team victoria brophy she's the one who was the juror juror in the last trial uh but i don't know who's victoria georgia was that wrong oh maybe it's three names and i missed one i don't know okay um but i don't i don't expect she'll play any kind of substantive role that we'll see in the courtroom uh every time jackson gets up i'm

[Speaker 4]
excited i just want to see that guy perform yeah he's he's great on cross how many people is the impeachments first week i mean he's and we're live hello come back

[Speaker 1]
um it was slightly longer than expected but uh not that much

[Speaker 2]
in your absence i have thoroughly looked into poise the answer is what we assumed

[Speaker 1]
ownership i mean and uh i don't know if i just save all those to observer that's probably best if you folks look in can i rename this i don't know maybe it's gonna be do whatever you want there we go so if you folks look in the journal tab you'll see a new folder called notes discovered and under that folder you'll see house baylor communications

[Speaker 3]
uh where are we looking in the journal tab journal okay

[Speaker 1]
the journal notes discovered you said indeed there's only one entry in there right now on one page

[Speaker 3]
uh kibbe can't read so

[Speaker 2]
rana has been and she reads it out i can read it out for all of you if you would like but we all have access to read i can read it what did james say i have no idea read it aloud okay dearest noble cayens of house baylor i have no desire to attack the people of bronlock funny and delicious as their glamour tastes i applaud your harvest and wouldn't want us to part in a poor mood please accept a token of my goodwill present under the one-eyed tree along the path to our you may open it safely by following our song regards lady becknor bell i wonder what their song is

[Speaker 1]
i wonder where the hollow is you guys know what the hollow is this tree or this trail

[Speaker 2]
we should keep our eyes open for trees with holes or something then i guess

[Speaker 1]
folks are a one-eyed tree recall knowledge or anything of that variety or use exploration to

[Speaker 2]
to search is this a cult or esoteric uh it's very esoteric at least not a cult huh i don't know if i might i can just do the bam and you can tell me if it's good or not um

[Speaker 3]
he might know if it's cult related

[Speaker 5]
proficiency is uh whoops do i need to roll privately

[Speaker 1]
survival no i could see that

[Speaker 5]
is

[Speaker 1]
you know that the fae among these lands have stones that they'll erect there's two ways that you can figure out a fae song one is you could have a fae of a given house or hollow you know whatever their organization is you could have them teach it to you or it's a shame you didn't bring it's a shame you didn't bring seagram whatever his name is the or there are stones etched with the song you just have to put it in the right order

[Speaker 3]
so those would have been perfect for garrus

[Speaker 1]
the carousel but you still had access to the other dude and you still didn't use them unbelievable

[Speaker 2]
he's not completely finished that's right did the gremlin run off after giving us this note or

[Speaker 1]
he's kind of like backing away expectantly

[Speaker 2]
before you leave gremlin do you know of the song that is mentioned in this note no i'm i'm in house

[Speaker 1]
i wouldn't know i wouldn't know uh i wouldn't know the hospital hollow's song no no sir are you

[Speaker 2]
lying to me you should not be lying to me i'm gonna call us this guy just in case he is um where is kawas i think it's an action you can just take i'll find it um called exploration it is that's exploration okay um yes james my exploration action is i'm bullying these gremlin um i get to roll intimidation check against their will dc which is i should have targeted him for that

[Speaker 1]
but uh he's got a plus six modifier taking frightened into account

[Speaker 2]
that is uh he wouldn't be frightened anymore unless you think he would still be okay well it's still a regular success so uh uh he uh will comply so if he isn't lying i assume he will probably not lie uh he'll continue not lying and if he is he might reveal something useful here i'll leave

[Speaker 1]
a goodie to to make sure he throws a squirrel at your feet

[Speaker 2]
okay okay very good run along where's the party sheet there we go now this man's gonna run off and scheme about killing rana for the next six months

[Speaker 1]
yeah

[Speaker 2]
that's awesome i love that like that could happen

[Speaker 1]
consequences of actions and things and there are some silver pieces around among these guys sweet

[Speaker 5]
who oh they didn't have the little looty chesty icons

[Speaker 2]
oh no you can just double click their tokens and steal all of their short swords oh wait that does we can't do that i don't know if you can steal their short swords actually i think you can yeah i think you can too look i don't want to loot any of their stuff that's a lot of bulk for crap more than happy if we uh 150 silver pieces

[Speaker 1]
this has been added to the party sheet as well as the scroll

[Speaker 2]
where is the party sheet there stash

[Speaker 3]
what i'm taking that one what is this

[Speaker 1]
it's a bad it's awful it's uh you know it sucks nobody needs to use it it's more of a joke really uh okay well uh that's awesome i think i need that

[Speaker 2]
the problem is you need to be able to cast that spell if you can use the scroll of it so really it should go to rana because she can cast any scroll with a you can also use what is it trick magic item you would need you would need trick magic item or um i think it's a it's an arcane or primal spell so i was it would be able to use it or a druid

[Speaker 3]
all right well susudio won't take it even though it has toads in it um because he doesn't like wasteful doesn't like wastefulness and it would be wasted on him

[Speaker 2]
we each want to take we could flick if we summoned it though

[Speaker 5]
imagine the party oh the colors can we do it now

[Speaker 2]
i'm gonna take 50 silver for each of my characters that participated i'm gonna move remove 100 from that wait is there any 150 there oh fuck yeah there is hang on wouldn't be uh 35 gold each so that's such an awful number so that's 75 would be 70

[Speaker 1]
yeah i'll take 75 yep there's uh i'm pretty sure you could still just click the even distribute

[Speaker 2]
button can you doesn't even distribute but i don't know how to do that from the party sheet

[Speaker 1]
on the party sheet i'm pretty sure you can or maybe i'm insane

[Speaker 2]
it's the the loot tokens have the distribute to party members but uh are you sure 35 is right because then there's still three characters that

[Speaker 5]
well 35 times two would be 70 and then that'd be 140 so it'd be 37.5 each

[Speaker 1]
it's just 30 30 it's just 30 it's five times this is 150 i'm going to give 10 silver back you probably thought there was an additional party member

[Speaker 2]
that's fine what there's four of us five there's a studio joined directors oh yeah yeah then that's just straight 30 each um add coins 30 silver oh okay how do i how do i need to take 30 i just minused it from the stash and then added 30 to my character oh now there's 80 oh did you take i try to buy this study so at the top of the stash if you just press the minus or remove coins just minus 30 yeah drag it straight to your character um yeah just drag it make it go through the same process so it's not like

[Speaker 3]
getting all fucked up just drag it straight to your character it should let you pick how much

[Speaker 5]
so you create a new stack

[Speaker 2]
i don't know just say me please um but i actually can't use the spell scroll yet but give me uh 100 xp and maybe that'll i will be taking the scroll it needs to run sessions to get rare spells when you can just have james give them out on scrolls i do need to give out more scrolls and potions

[Speaker 1]
is the hardest thing to remember

[Speaker 2]
i love that generator because it just generates some of the like most useless potions ever and i just give them out like yeah this is good loot guys solid oh you want more snares you have like three more snares okay i love snares a bit useful in this game you should have them yeah i want

[Speaker 5]
this but i feel like it's not worth the fate like i really want to do it but like is it fate worthy

[Speaker 1]
probably not like you're making trails through the skies which was like that um they're just blocking it out mostly for you know airship supplement but for pathfinder second edition we're gonna have a bunch of warplanes in there and we're trying to figure out like equivalents for each class so that they could do cool shit and the biggest thing was like we we kept adding snares that like the planes could launch behind them

[Speaker 2]
so somebody was going to stare alchemist can alchemist can unleash agent orange that that was kind of the idea

[Speaker 1]
we weren't sure if we could get away with it but we were gonna do it hmm all right so there was a survival check earlier and then what are what exploration actions are people taking

[Speaker 3]
ah um for the next day it's two days oh sorry okay uh kibi would want to do whatever protection she can like you know guarding her friends that kind of thing

[Speaker 2]
so that would be like a perception yeah that would be like the seek one we'll keep Nova doing the uh scout for the initiative bonus we all get where is seek you on the exploration uh tab of your actions yep if you're in exploration i think it is a search is the one you want so you need to add

[Speaker 3]
search to your list there uh this is i don't know how to do any of that no it's all right so i'm

[Speaker 1]
looking at yours right now uh it's a thing so there's seek you are the best in the party at seek you tell me i'm gonna take a screenshot and tell me if this looks different from what you have

[Speaker 10]
okie dokie

[Speaker 3]
some voiceover flow so yeah okay so that's encounter

[Speaker 1]
let me look well that shows that shows all three right so there's encounter where do you see that

[Speaker 2]
that's in the basic action macro it's um okay i see it yeah all right i was i was looking at

[Speaker 1]
exploration my bad oh you can click these into it that's so oh man i thought okay

[Speaker 2]
so down the bottom left you've got a macro folder it's like near where our player names are in that one there should be basic action macros uh yeah you can drag that into your hotbar down the bottom

[Speaker 5]
oh wait no that rolls it how do i edit on this so i can add it to the character sheet

[Speaker 2]
that you would just have to find the action in the exploration um uh compendium browser ah perfect uh the seek is a secret check i exposed it intentionally because it's a really high roll ah nice yeah i love doing that i like there's not one you rolled on your secret check but i believe the exploration version of seek is search which it is just a seek check while exploring

[Speaker 5]
all right so i've got the slot and anytime i try to drag it like the group sheet shuts what sorry so i've got the activity and it's got slot available and so i press it and it brings up my character's action section and i've got a like notice there but i don't know how to set it on there so it does it to fill the slot

[Speaker 1]
uh you already have like the active worried about it

[Speaker 2]
it's just you've rolled don't stress about it no just so i know for future so i can set it up

[Speaker 1]
so like yeah you click active and that'll be uh something's done for me yes then oh susudio gets to can do some stuff as well he does i completely forgot about anything with uh like searching or like i guess i guess kibi is technically searching

[Speaker 2]
i want to get her investigate but that got us the music knowledge

[Speaker 3]
susudio is not the best at literally anything um that's okay i didn't really know how to build a monk i just winged it everybody else neglected

[Speaker 1]
to do anything with the hollow or or searching for loot or anything like that but that's fine

[Speaker 5]
no no we try to do it i wrote uh like a 16 or something for survival to find it yeah we're doing avoid notice um we're already there no so what's so we uh like another travel

[Speaker 3]
wait we're like you know our directions or that would be

[Speaker 2]
would be such probably to find this thing you guys already know where the hollow is oh it's been

[Speaker 5]
that's gonna say do we really know where it is what do we need to know where the hollow is we

[Speaker 2]
don't know where the tree is uh you don't oh i can climb hold on what if i climb up a tree and

[Speaker 3]
look that's still a search check okay all right cool cool cool do you seek and then what is my

[Speaker 1]
bonus plus two bonus for searching for climbing up a tree there you go

[Speaker 3]
now he's gonna look for a one-eyed tree whatever that means he'll know when he sees it

[Speaker 1]
uh the tree noticing that it's been spotted turns to look at you and then turns away it's uh it's further it is during this uh this next day's travel so we're able to point out exactly where the trail kind of departs you take your party down a deer trail and there's a clearing where this not willow what am i thinking of it's a it's a sycamore with very very bright yellow leaves it's a lot of fall colors but like lively and you know the leaves themselves are not actually the leaves themselves are not dying it just kind of looks like a very lively it's very lively it's just in fall colors

[Speaker 5]
sorry so you also said it's a new day yes it's for the next day

[Speaker 1]
and there is a if i say a face it's really a nose and an eyes and two eye sockets only one of which is occupied they're just kind of like sticking out of where the crown not where the crown of the tree is um where most of the branches kind of split off from the main trunk

[Speaker 2]
and there's just you guys were really sorry can you please remind me about the song so um the the gremlin didn't the one that we questioned didn't know the song that's correct um so so is there any way for us to follow it without knowing it i don't think so right it's specific song for whatever fey has done this or fey group sorry can you ask your question again um how do we follow the song is that something we know well following the song is

[Speaker 1]
following the song is to like uh what's the exact instructions i should like we should both be looking at the exact instructions while we do this

[Speaker 2]
is that like a like metaphorical like following the song though like the song lyrics describe how to find the treasure all right so what is the note says what it says okay and

[Speaker 1]
and you know we don't know this can be learned from either stones that are sort of headed around the um stones have been headed around the area or they kind of like mark its territory or you can learn it from a fey of that house

[Speaker 2]
uh would i can i use my investigate uh exploration to try and find any stones that could share the song or would i should i roll again

[Speaker 1]
what was your previous investigate oh that was i don't know a secret oh that's right you didn't recall knowledge no you'd be doing a new role i'm just going to be yep sure um i'll just do that again also did you guys want to rest before you continue because it will be a new day i'm going to press the button

[Speaker 2]
do h and kibi have a means of healing the last of the hit points they're missing

[Speaker 5]
yeah yeah that's what i'm saying before and uh like some healing

[Speaker 3]
uh i could do i guess i could use some healing because i kimi didn't get hit too much uh yeah she didn't get hit too much she's probably fine uh and i don't think susudio got hit at all so he's fine as well okay yeah we're good we don't

[Speaker 5]
need any healing so we've discussed before can i prepare dipping a set of blow gun darts into poison so they're already pre-poisoned yes you can as long as you have the poisons

[Speaker 2]
and the dots for it yep but just trying to find out how many that darts is a poison one one each i'm fairly certain it's one

[Speaker 1]
okay there we go sorry but i had to send in a um a communication about a trademark dispute oh boy i have an intent to challenge there's this one fucking asshole who like like oh you guys are using the term bronstein but that's not um but it's not really bronstein unless you're playing with david wesley because he didn't publish the rules so it can't possibly be you don't have to know what any of these terms are just imagine that you know how you guys know what the term west marches is right yeah yeah and like so that was the name of a guy's campaign who kind of started the style and like there were other versions of this like bronstein for instance ages ago it's just nobody followed up on them um it would be like not the guy who who ben robbins i think is his name not the not the guy who made or started doing west marches or coined that term or anything be like if his best friend went around threatening people with legal action for using the term west marches the fact well i just want to protect his ip and so that fucker uh filed uh intent to his company filed the intent to trademark the term bronstein uh and i have a i have a program called bronstein manager which i'm looking to release at some point i don't know but i'm gonna fucking file to oppose that piece of shit i've been holding off because i have a friend who's at a convention with that guy right now and everything's very uh very touchy but apparently i'm not sure but i think something just happened at that convention so we're gonna find out anyways

[Speaker 2]
uh sorry what was the name of the other gremlins that we fought the ones that look different are they all gremlins or are they i'm trying to get notes for the report oh yeah

[Speaker 1]
all gremlins they have two there's two different types there's the uh mit flit it sounds like a slur and then the jenkin which sounds like a worse slur

[Speaker 2]
okay i knew they had names like that because i've ran them both before but i just couldn't

[Speaker 1]
remember thank you all right now i'm just looking for the xp somewhere around here i might be able to access there is there a button for that like xp distribution should be down the hot bar um oh assign xp reason very cool

[Speaker 2]
that should just bring up the same one that comes up after combat i think i love that module

[Speaker 1]
two days successful travel hot dog

[Speaker 3]
hey nice rana get it girl

[Speaker 1]
and then that was a level two encounter so i am going to double that xp that susudio received earlier which was 156 so i'm going to add another 156 to

[Speaker 2]
susunio well thank you rana was level one when we did the info i don't believe

[Speaker 1]
i i say seeing that you just leveled up in the chat oh that's totally fine six and knowing about that rule is really important because like you guys do need to be able to catch up when you're when you're behind i do want to apply that to people especially because i i know i'm not going to be able to hold back by like uh i love like underleveled encounters i love deploying those but at the same time i also love the other you know the overleveled ones and stuff is going on so if somebody's going in with a lower level character for something that's already above their level like i i need to be able to to juice them up in exchange for not dying you know

[Speaker 5]
oh man i play the game and uh the dm's like oh this is like a cr3 creature we're fine against you level one party and we're like no

[Speaker 1]
i have thrown cr3 against these guys um but not with the expectation that it would be fine and there were environmental conditions that made it uh you know that gave them some free hits beforehand because it was a plate carcass you're able to get some hits in before the water level rose far enough that the party was in the

[Speaker 5]
water yeah this thing had like a plus 11 roll this thing had like plus 11 rolls and i think our highest ac person was like 16 yeah no that's it's gonna spread all the time all the time yeah yeah and we're like yeah we got nothing against

[Speaker 1]
this creature plus the ac is gonna be done i do like this encounter builder i just wish i had like the randomized thing yeah that would be nice

[Speaker 3]
i just added an edict to kibi's sheet that will absolutely get her in trouble later

[Speaker 1]
oh fuck yeah what did you make honestly all right all right anytime rana you did discover a bunch of stones it took you a little while you found three of them uh you were able to put them i'm not going to make you go into a puzzle at the moment uh you were able to put the three of them together correctly does anybody here speak the fey language damn it no

[Speaker 5]
um i do not i do i speak common taldane daemonic draconic elven fey goblin demonic yeah yeah i apparently know those languages nice

[Speaker 1]
i guess if you want you can uh sing to oh it doesn't want to let anything above that all right that's

[Speaker 5]
i'd like to attempt to sing in a very goggly voice

[Speaker 3]
in the fey language oh tv claps

[Speaker 2]
james can you be a real one for me right now what's up i want to i want to spend one of rana one of my rare tags on rana's archetype curse maelstrom and the prerequisite is that you are cursed in something here right now curse uh what did you take from the last encounter

[Speaker 1]
sorry what did you take from the last encounter or what did rana take from last encounter

[Speaker 2]
uh silver from the guy the frog's scroll and the silver from the guy that we bullied

[Speaker 1]
that's right you took the frog's uh scroll yes

[Speaker 2]
absolute legend convenient

[Speaker 1]
convenient

[Speaker 2]
all right so well thank you that's so good

[Speaker 1]
all right so you sing and the you sing this thing uh the sycamore tree parts its roots and kind of like leans backwards as a massive trapdoor spider peeks out it's kind of wearing it's kind of like wearing this thing is like a cap wearing the sycamore tree as a cap almost and pushes itself out further and further and draws up some string presents you with a large it looks like a bowl it just looks like a really it just looks like a large light bulb but composed of resin and stained glass and without actually placing it on the ground a stem grows from this bulb and embeds itself in the ground in front of you guys and then the trapdoor spider goes back down into the goes back goes back to its home

[Speaker 5]
i'd like to hold the bulb above my head

[Speaker 1]
it's quite large i don't know if this is like it's

[Speaker 5]
if i tilt it forward and then put my head so it would be under it would it then illuminate yeah absolutely all right does it give me any profound knowledge

[Speaker 1]
no you could just see a bunch of goodies in it so i'll just i'll just call it little old that's right so this is the one that has distribute coins yes i just remembered the

[Speaker 2]
rana was allowed to take rare stuff anyway so she's probably been cursed before

[Speaker 3]
what is this about a curse and rare stuff is that like a price you have to pay for rare stuff

[Speaker 2]
no this specific rare thing needs you to be have been cursed and i think it makes sense for rana because she's unlucky but basically you have a an innate curse that is like jealous so if you receive any other curses it tries to like eat them to negate them

[Speaker 3]
oh appetizing flavor snare

[Speaker 1]
very effective against kiwi

[Speaker 3]
yeah

[Speaker 1]
all right that is everything

[Speaker 5]
oh what kind of ammunition is the bang ammunition

[Speaker 1]
what kind of ammunition i'm looking for

[Speaker 5]
i'm looking for darts

[Speaker 1]
as you feel around inside the package a little bit more you can feel darts come to your hand

[Speaker 5]
are they the bane darts that are there it's in the ball it's in the ball double click on the ball i know i'm that's what i'm saying because i see the bane ammunition in there but that's

[Speaker 1]
confirm if they're the dots yeah no that's that's reasonable i mean you have you been bitten by a rabid gm i feel like you give me that energy where like somebody has hurt you

[Speaker 5]
in the past everyone hurts me oh i come from australia you gotta be cautious of everything

[Speaker 2]
it's totally valid rana would like to take a healing potion and the fayfel if that's okay with the rest of you

[Speaker 5]
yeah yeah who who would like the uh the bane ammunition and a healing potion so we can learn how to make them uh pb wants the snares

[Speaker 2]
hell yeah a healing potion is a magical item not an alchemical if that does change yeah yeah no i can't use that then you would need magical crafting to do that one yep anova doesn't want anything so

[Speaker 3]
oops yeah okay there we go look at that what is it glowing rod excuse me

[Speaker 2]
that's a it's a ever-burning torch i think i know it's a glue stick that lasts for six hours and then a fruit i think it's a fruit that works like a lantern for eight hours but it's a lot better

[Speaker 5]
yeah i think a normal one's 20 20 where the fruit's like a 60. okay oh no it's 60 60 the glowing lantern fruit shed bright lights in 60 foot radius and dim light for the next 60 feet

[Speaker 2]
so it's 120 light for eight hours yeah see nova would take a lantern fruit if that's okay

[Speaker 3]
i might give uh there's a healing potion here did somebody already take that there were two i took one okay and then somebody else was taking the other okay

[Speaker 5]
uh you can take it if you want taking a fruit who realizes it's not something he can make or recreate okay because i'm thinking

[Speaker 3]
sesudio might need that he's got 17 health which isn't horrible but it's definitely not kiby's um

[Speaker 5]
38 health i think she'll give you some yummy yummy goop that'll pop you right up and he like twinkles his fingers

[Speaker 3]
sesudio is currently fully healed yeah sesudio is fully healed he's just um it could have built him better but you know we live and we learn or we die i don't know how could i have built him better um so what are their main i put uh a three in dex and a two in wisdom and those are his highest highest everything else

[Speaker 2]
you spread it yeah like you don't need a plus four um what's your strength one oh

[Speaker 3]
so am i able to get rid of go back and get like get rid of charisma oh there was nowhere to put that hold on if i do this okay james do i have your permission to

[Speaker 1]
do that uh yeah i think sesudio has only been in one all right so here's the thing i'm going to do a bunch of stuff with the map for the hollow um i went late today which is why i was nervous about actually doing anything tonight but if we started at roughly the same time tomorrow i would be able to run again because i no longer have a morning shift on sunday i moved it to uh to an evening shift on sunday and then after my evening shift i go to my night shift at the other job but anyways if you guys wanted um i would be able to run again tomorrow at the same time and i would be able to uh if you guys are agree to that then i am okay to also run a few additional encounters just in the surrounding area

[Speaker 2]
okay i think i have a couple of rounds to run tomorrow i'll need to double check when i'm free

[Speaker 1]
i would be able to go for a while because i because i finally get to sleep in sunday morning so with that in mind i should have like taken a screenshot of the the items that we just received yeah i should have just taken like a screenshot of the items or the stuff that was in the uh inside the loophole just for future reference

[Speaker 2]
i can put back all the stuff i took into it for a second

[Speaker 1]
yeah you're fine you're fine because what i'm going to do is just have like a default uh loot containers that i can then like modify it that way it's easier to like just drum up on the fly yep do i need a ton of loot

[Speaker 3]
oh one more time uh do i need strength for susudio for my monk

[Speaker 2]
he it's nice because it's extra damage per hit um okay um do i need wisdom do you always necessarily um you can there are several like archetypes of monk you can be there's like the key warrior where you do like key related things um if you were doing that then you would want wisdom but if you were just going to be a brawler you could get away with just like having

[Speaker 3]
good strength dexcon uh what are the subclass archetypes sorry um the what what archetypes um do monks usually have they have uh

[Speaker 2]
they don't have like a like a subclass or anything it's like all depending on how you build them with fates uh okay um because i think i'm just gonna have like a smacky smacky um

[Speaker 10]
might dip into rogue just because backstory stuff so you'd want high dex uh

[Speaker 5]
um during a high strength index because i don't think so even though you use your like dexter attack you still get your strength uh strength fortify for damage

[Speaker 2]
i'd have to look at so there's sort of like three types of monk i guess there's strength based there's dex based and there's key based um definitely gonna be dex but i have

[Speaker 3]
the highest i can go with dex is three right now is it your key ability there's um

[Speaker 10]
oh let me look at that actually could i good question so that would be

[Speaker 2]
that'd be this is that what you're talking about uh no sorry so if you're looking at your character sheet and you're looking at your stats uh it has like attribute boosts there's the class um it'll say monk and then say key there for your key ability

[Speaker 10]
you can probably pick dex as that it just says key attributes dexterity and strength

[Speaker 2]
do you have one of them selected in red

[Speaker 3]
oh are we where are we looking at again because i just went to class

[Speaker 2]
uh so it's on your character sheet in the foundry there is all of your stats i'll show you mine to show you what i'm looking at yeah low on lowing on i'm running on low brain cells right now i'm very tired you can get to this by clicking the edit button for your attribute modifiers so going through going through novice she gets um i think strength and one other boost from being a human so i picked strength and charisma for my background i've picked strength and con from my class i get a boost to strength because it's my key ability but i could pick dex alternatively and then at level one i picked strength dex con charisma and then i have started picking them for my next set as well okay yeah no i i picked dex okay and you probably want to try and get a background or your ancestry boost to dex as well okay like either one stat and then a free stat so you can always go for dex ideally you would want like plus four dex but plus three is probably fine as well um you would want at least plus one in strength maybe plus two and you want a pretty good constitution as well i think i think your priority should be dex maybe wisdom and con second strength and charisma uh sorry strength third

[Speaker 10]
uh charisma and intelligence you don't need everyone needs a little bit of intelligence

[Speaker 2]
like when you hit level two you'll get a boost and you can put it in one of your other stats anyway and you keep doing that until you get to level five

[Speaker 3]
and you said i needed to do something with like a feat uh so it depends what

[Speaker 2]
like not at the moment i think your stance is your feet which is

[Speaker 3]
he is as good as he can be i think right now i have changed i changed the i got rid of charisma he doesn't need that he doesn't he probably doesn't uh look very friendly but he is uh so charisma is a zero well he doesn't have a negative so he's not bad at it

[Speaker 2]
he's just not like you'll get more use out of having um diplomacy trained than having

[Speaker 3]
like a high charisma um so wisdom and intelligence i would rather him have intelligence

[Speaker 2]
over wisdom but do i need wisdom or you want to do key abilities you will need it but if you don't want to do key abilities then you don't need it uh what are the abilities uh i think the first one you get is key rush uh no you don't need key wisdom for that um they're focus spells that you get um

[Speaker 3]
but i can i can just go into that as i level up right if i want to just add more wisdom later on

[Speaker 6]
there's an optional rule for um

[Speaker 1]
increasing the pace basically or making it more spread out i don't know getting more ability score increases earlier do i have to turn that on somewhere uh you already have it turned on

[Speaker 2]
that's the gradual ability boost i think we talked about this before

[Speaker 1]
yeah gradual all right sweet so it's one for your type

[Speaker 2]
uh so monks can learn key spells if you want to focus on key spells then you might want wisdom over intelligence but uh you can boost it later like i think i'm just gonna boost it later

[Speaker 3]
yeah you'll be fine because you get full boost wisdom uh considering he's been locked in a tomb

[Speaker 1]
for his entire life the mythic rules are invariant what are those i don't i don't actually i haven't

[Speaker 2]
read the mythic rules still i think it's like extra dedications and stuff mythic proficiency i don't i think it's like a i think it's like hero points but it's like for things that you're mythical at you can spend them i haven't seen anything of it i just don't think it's very uh well fleshed out from what i've seen on reddit but

[Speaker 3]
yeah um and then for um if i have if i'm trained in the skill and i'm uh putting in my skills during character creation

[Speaker 2]
but i'm already trained in one due to a background can i up train and go like to expert no you can't up train i think you can just pick another skill okay um i i would like to search for encounters before we wrap up

[Speaker 1]
yes and begin some exploration roles and what kind of uh all right

[Speaker 10]
ones are you looking for he's gonna um i can look at the party sheet does anyone have a compass

[Speaker 2]
yes what sort of exploration are we doing the the whole uh sense direction

[Speaker 1]
um all right so exploration sort of it is exploration okay him i think he has a horse

[Speaker 10]
she let it go she doesn't need a horse

[Speaker 5]
still in a town can i buy a corpse compass

[Speaker 1]
no

[Speaker 2]
there is a feed for that sort of like i would have bought this but don't have it that's later on when we get back

[Speaker 3]
well kiwi is going to be um looking for anything interesting at all that catches her attention

[Speaker 2]
whatever that be we need to know where we are we can just get lost yeah

[Speaker 5]
we just need to follow go back south when we never want to return home interesting interesting

[Speaker 3]
where did my music go um and it's a studio i don't know man he could just be like it's not particularly great at anything now so there's nothing wrong with just filling

[Speaker 1]
in for something that hasn't been that hasn't been selected or could be weird and or useful and this is a very good location for something like that

[Speaker 3]
um when does he get his camera

[Speaker 1]
excellent question we will we will follow up with that soon i think

[Speaker 3]
okay spend a downtime action all right all right uh i'm gonna have him go up in a tree again uh

[Speaker 2]
should i have him climb or seek i think that would be a seek search all right so that's

[Speaker 3]
kiwi looking for anything interesting at all um and susudio looking for things uh up in a tree

[Speaker 2]
rana will keep with the investigating i know uh the better of getting in the way of my party so i

[Speaker 1]
will avoid notice all right so and susudio is looking for something in a tree he's up in a

[Speaker 3]
tree looking down at the forest um and the land itself to see if he can spot anything of interest

[Speaker 1]
yeah well most important is this one so i'm going to reveal that to everybody

[Speaker 3]
oh boy oh okay

[Speaker 1]
walking through the forest you find

[Speaker 3]
a unicorn oh my god it's a fucking unicorn

[Speaker 5]
um uh uh can i do uh some kind of knowledge check to determine what i know about unicorns sure i might need a i don't know what they might fall under like nature or

[Speaker 1]
because i do know their magic knowledge using the basic action macro but macro does every check for you yeah it just shows me all the check results is uh that's why i'm mentioning it so uh

[Speaker 5]
so so what does that actually show you that recall knowledge one it shows you every

[Speaker 2]
skill you have and uh what you rolled and any modifiers that's cool

[Speaker 5]
because i know it's like normally recall knowledge like you know you choose like what

[Speaker 2]
you'll roam against if my dm will pick your best yeah

[Speaker 5]
this ability to recall ammunition

[Speaker 3]
um what would susudio's recall knowledge be oh boy okay okay i brought two smooth brains three including myself to this game

[Speaker 1]
all right so you hooch you don't have anything specific for this um

[Speaker 2]
anybody else is free to do some i don't just call it hello can you understand me

[Speaker 1]
yeah it uh nods its head

[Speaker 3]
kibi's gonna offer it a gold piece it cocks its head at you it's kind of amused even if it doesn't take it she's gonna like place it on the ground uh and then back away kibi is very very excited she can barely contain it

[Speaker 5]
quick thesis and he quickly makes up a

[Speaker 1]
yeah i was just about to say it ignores the it ignores the gold piece and just strides up to kibi

[Speaker 3]
oh hello hello you have a very sharp horn kibi kibi likes that it is sharp to sharpen these teeth

[Speaker 1]
no it's only this one okay what are you what's up what brings you here

[Speaker 3]
is it speaking to us it is oh my god evie's like did you choose speaking

[Speaker 5]
um speaking in a language we can understand right

[Speaker 3]
tree uh uh one-eyed tree

[Speaker 1]
yes we did what do you remain you must still be looking for something

[Speaker 2]
kibi was just heading to the spider queen's hollow

[Speaker 1]
i typed that using hooch did i mean to do that all right so folks start using your uh discover or influence if you would like to

[Speaker 2]
whatever you want to do like to do a discover with recall knowledge um with my occult uh i'm just gonna roll the check and have the penalty because it's not really a recall knowledge uh it's blind gene

[Speaker 1]
so unicorns aren't really about the they're not really about the idea of like you know making deals they're they're judgmental they're gentle but they are judgmental and at the mention of the spider queen the false widow as she is known she does look a little bit uh looks a little bit perturbed or annoyed

[Speaker 3]
i don't exactly know what kibi can do other than fangirl by seeing a uh unicorn uh let's see what susudio can do

[Speaker 1]
she's still expectantly waiting for an answer from kibi

[Speaker 3]
oh uh what was the question what is it that you're still seeking here

[Speaker 1]
no offense adventure no just simple adventure no higher goals no noble intention

[Speaker 3]
kibi protects her friends but mostly adventure

[Speaker 1]
you said susudio was doing a discover you're trying to do something

[Speaker 3]
um i was mostly just thinking out loud um i don't know what he can do other than you know what we're gonna do a recall knowledge it cannot hurt he's got unless it can he's got nothing all right he seems very cautiously interested

[Speaker 1]
let's be honest with you we haven't met in your previous you met in your previous adventure that you took through this land and if i could sense how you seem genuine enough

[Speaker 3]
previous adventure indeed before the clock was turned back on this land you remember kibi

[Speaker 1]
no we haven't met well that makes sense but i can smell it on you you have been through this land before i can smell that you remember your time here tell me what do you think of house baylor

[Speaker 3]
what do i know about house baylor are they more good aligned or evil aligned hold on that note earlier said something about eating glamour yeah he's not the best talker she's mostly just smashy smashy

[Speaker 5]
sorry you go i was gonna say hoops seen that uh offering works looks for his inventory to see what might be effective and places down an elixir of life on the ground and a little bit further away some refined fish that's the only thing edible i really have my inventory i'm wearing

[Speaker 1]
yes i don't think your girlfriend understood the question

[Speaker 2]
i think house baylor are plotting something in brownlock i've heard talk of demons

[Speaker 1]
for talk of demons and i can smell encounters with demons on this one but i don't know if she's friend or foe to them you don't seem like you'll be a friend to them but i need to know if you would oppose them

[Speaker 3]
or is she asking that of kiby or rana asking that of kiby oh kiby does not like demons

[Speaker 1]
so even if they weren't just coming after your friends you'd be willing to fight them

[Speaker 3]
oh yes kiby opposes all evil even distant evil and the cold he does not like the cold or water

[Speaker 1]
house baylor has two hollows one is further to the north much further up north so it's not within walking distance but the other isn't so far from brownlock itself it's a new hollow that they've set up i can tell you where it is but it can only be opened by the song that noble cayennes makes with his loot and i don't know who he's disguising himself as at the moment so you're going to know you would have to do this but if you did this a lamp would open you a great debt and you would have a hollow to deal with as you wished if you're in search of allies it could be useful but more importantly you would be calling others to the path of righteousness and standing against this rather rather dreadful plague that's taking over brownlock is there a way to identify him i do not i'm gonna have to leave that to you what i can do is i can give you the location as i mentioned of his hollow nearby you find him take his loot go to the hollow and purge it and you shouldn't have any problem keeping away now keeping demons away from brownlock for the time being what was his name sorry was that cayenne's it's the same one that's in the in the

[Speaker 2]
yep um and that was to both hollows that we don't know his song so we cannot enter them was that one specific hollow

[Speaker 1]
both both as in like it's you don't know the song so you're not able to access either of them

[Speaker 2]
so now nova is not a smart woman also however she does remember in brownlock seeing a person if they disguised as an elf does that sound like the right guy did the unicorn

[Speaker 1]
if they disguised as an elf do you remember anything else about him uh no i can smell him on you that's him noble kindness oh i love that

[Speaker 2]
yeah he's disguised like an elf sorta um unicorn sticks a couple of times i can smell his gold on you oh yep my bad i didn't know he was up to anything but i can get rid of the gold if you think that it changed something but i really just want to go kick his teeth in now tell you what

[Speaker 1]
nope you're on your way to meet with the spider queen yes that was the plan toss your gold into the uh toss your gold into the pond or yonder she points over with her horn to the left you're sorry to the west

[Speaker 2]
and uh come back in a day to it yep sure cool what what will happen it'll help you find me oh sorry just out of character when you say loot it's l u t e loot or yep thank you and that loot unicorn claims it'll protect bronlock from the demon in uh disease spreading

[Speaker 1]
nope but i'll let you into his hollow nearby and purge that hollow you'll be able to install a new noble more importantly you'll be able to purge his grasp of power over the area and the cult that's been importing these demons will be significantly weakened then we'll be able to maintain control over so many

[Speaker 2]
gotcha i'm not a smart woman to know this that uh that makes sense yep you don't need to be smart maybe it is lucky i took these coins

[Speaker 1]
oh there we go

[Speaker 2]
this noble cayenne's is he so he's the leader of all of house baylor or is it just these hollows

[Speaker 1]
house baylor is local so yes he is the leader he is the present ruler of house baylor

[Speaker 3]
this cult uh this is susudio speaking up finally a little weirdo in the back um

[Speaker 1]
oh boy great this cult what does it believe in i wish i knew more about them but i know that they're new and i know that they're not interested all that interested in demons except as a means to summon greater masters there's a fiend that they uh a devil that they serve and again i smelled on them and he's quite powerful but not one of the dukes not one of the archdukes but somebody else who traveled this land before the same smell that you have where you've traveled this land before and you remember the land before the clock was turned back beyond that i can't say but if you find whoever's been rendering their maid i'm sure you'll be able to discover more and then rally more troops to your cause i do wish i could be more helpful in that regard but the forests here are my domain i don't know too much about the city

[Speaker 2]
rana says oh no you've been very helpful thank you unicorn she's been i like she's been furiously taking notes and we'll make sure curtsy as well while continuing to write this all down happy to leave this unicorn in peace now um if no one else has anything they want from it

[Speaker 3]
he's just gonna thank the unicorn uh compliment them a few more times uh and

[Speaker 5]
be ready to go pitch also uh bounce his head and he's like yeah yeah yeah if he doesn't want him he'll take him with him and head off otherwise if there's an indication that the unicorn might like them to leave them

[Speaker 1]
uh it pays it pays no attention to it unfortunately i think you missed where i i mentioned that they what is it um there's a moderate encounter all right that's another cool

[Speaker 2]
unicorn didn't want to get high

[Speaker 1]
no i i do feel bad because it's like creatures no just show me all the what is it i have to manually select you guys that's fine that's fine we're all right here i think five together's five we're good yep

[Speaker 2]
yeah it does get tricky with how many actors are in the world oops oops something we like to hear all of the player character actors specifically but yeah dunker's characters deserve xp sure absolutely

[Speaker 3]
how is kibe already close to leveling up

[Speaker 2]
like that's an xp isn't a whole lot yeah that's true doing it slowly at the

[Speaker 1]
beginning because i was bad and learning the game that's all

[Speaker 2]
like the faster we get through encounters the more xp we get like

[Speaker 1]
no opening a session with combat is really helpful for that

[Speaker 2]
kibe will be strong very soon avoiding a fight is the same as like beating them like xp um i like giving out xp for exploration and stuff um like yeah same um i guess we'll keep exploring for other stuff

[Speaker 3]
um question so i forgot to give to assign kibe um i forgot to give her an extra attribute when i leveled up when i click boost on strength it says partial what does that mean once you get to plus

[Speaker 2]
four strength it takes two boosts to get to plus five okay we're not gonna bother with that yet thank you yes i'd do that one last all right that's all that's um an artifact from when they had ability scores it took out two boosts to get um higher in like past 18 but now it's just modifiers

[Speaker 1]
so very good all right so i will let you folks go to different encounters i guess the other thing is i gave you guys technically two days of travel so it was like 50 xp per day i think and then the influence encounter it's like moderate for the same level so that came out to about 100 xp as well nice there's more sources of xp which is nice

[Speaker 2]
i don't think it's essential giving an xp for like everything if like we're doing a fight every day for example then like that's probably enough um yeah that that's good uh i guess rana will keep investigating i'll roll a new uh recall knowledge check for that um nova will keep sensing direction i suppose

[Speaker 3]
um and so they gave us the we're going towards the hollow um is that the same place as the spider queen or okay and we know where that is

[Speaker 1]
how far away is it well until you got lost a moment ago navigating back to the trail that would have led you directly to the spider queen's hollow or the false widow hollow as it's known you have no that's at the end of the trail that you're following well can we get back to the trail well that's what you guys were trying to do a moment ago okay well either of landy's characters have succeeded in doing so i feel comfortable revealing that information because you would have noticed that you were not currently on the trail

[Speaker 2]
okay we're gonna climb a tree again she wasn't doing anything to help with that she was just investigating everything around her and didn't notice that she was walking off trickles entirely she's like taking notes of uh trees and things if anything we're anti-helping

[Speaker 3]
um there should be a plus two added to the roll that i just made i think if there's not i don't think it's added no kibi i don't i don't really know what kibi can do she's not really good at finding her way she's good at finding things and things that she's not supposed to find but she's not great at finding her way and navigating um okay yeah kibi's just gonna be making sure we're not gonna get ambushed that's that's really all she's going to be doing which would be a seek yes

[Speaker 1]
more see you already have one guy seeking

[Speaker 3]
well they're doing different things as seeking one is seeking for like you know finding the path kibi is seeking so that we can not get ambushed yeah the search is different to sense direction

[Speaker 1]
your sense direction is the one that's gonna sense direction is the one that's

[Speaker 2]
the search will stop us getting ambushed okay there's kibi

[Speaker 1]
you find moment kibi go ahead and roll me 64 oh my god okay so that's just slash roll six

[Speaker 3]
d four no that's five four all right you need them individually or all together

[Speaker 1]
uh what's the total 16 16 so you find the trail by way of tracking a monster about 160 feet away diving through the clouds is a manticore what is a manticore it's large it's a creature with a human face a lion's body and eagle wings and this one has quills on the back of its tail

[Speaker 3]
this one has a scorpion tail on the back are these things usually friendly

[Speaker 1]
vicious monstrosities and based on the screams that you can hear further towards the trail you can assume that well even if sometimes they were friendly this one certainly is not

[Speaker 3]
well if it's further towards the trail the way we need to be going

[Speaker 7]
oh robin you could join in that's fine sweet uh versus veal yeah jump scare hell yeah feel would be a good source of screams further up the trail as a note

[Speaker 1]
there's hope what is the party doing

[Speaker 3]
uh kibi's gonna be heading towards the manticore

[Speaker 7]
i think veal is currently being mulled by a manticore

[Speaker 2]
would i need a new recall knowledge or is my one from before fine for manticore as in fine as in i've failed yeah you would need to if you're doing a recall knowledge on the manticore you would need to do a uh if that's not part of my investigate sure i'll do a

[Speaker 1]
new one um there you go uh the the biggest thing that's uh of note to you is that this foe is beyond

[Speaker 2]
you please someone stop kibi oh no no no don't we should hide that will kill us please

[Speaker 3]
please but kibi is big no not that big oh fine fine if kibi does not have her allies backing her

[Speaker 2]
uh no we should hide definitely hide or run or both which is ahead of you he killed her from the shadows so having having looked

[Speaker 1]
up i was like oh he he moved ahead no that's not what he meant i love pooch so the uh what the fuck was that anyway as i say yeah so as you move a little bit further up you can see that there's a or because you have moved further up you can see that there's uh currently in manticore it's disemboweled two horses uh there's a bunch of scattered bodies and there is this is like an area of the forest the the reason manticore dived or dove down here is because there's a canopy especially thick canopy towards this end of the forest trail and uh and so it dove down before these people could get to cover there are about six bodies scattered about and there are two people there's a man a woman hiding under the underneath the carriage itself and they're just kind of trying to keep themselves as quiet as possible not you know not doing anything man has his hand over the woman's mouth as like the manticore's just kind of like stalking around angrily occasionally taking like a chunk out of the bodies nearby

[Speaker 7]
feel is a little bit off the road just trying her best to be hidden as well

[Speaker 1]
yeah there's a few ways for you guys to go about this but this isn't the tutorial zone so it's your turn to be thinking

[Speaker 3]
how about you throw around it with poison let's just go around it let's just go around

[Speaker 1]
that is one option there's people there that are stuck until they leave oh yeah

[Speaker 3]
yeah we could distract oh oh oh uh kibi has uh kibi has uh this this oh i pressed the wrong button that can be used as a distraction it probably won't catch them but it will distract them

[Speaker 7]
so we need something to get hit by the snare

[Speaker 2]
uh can we throw one of these corpses ron and keith here on the same wavelength

[Speaker 7]
oh it's bad news for rana whatever gets these things away

[Speaker 2]
if you give me a second i can run over and grab them both probably nova um

[Speaker 7]
so we lay a trap prop up a corpse and then let it fall onto the trap and then hope that draws their attention i'm gonna pull out a new scene

[Speaker 2]
i i think that's a good plan like both my characters think that's good

[Speaker 3]
it is a creature it just happens to be a dead creature

[Speaker 2]
we could do like a crafting check or something to set up a trap to bait it away and like some athletics or other stuff too is this like a skill challenge

[Speaker 3]
the idea is get them away so that everybody can get away without encountering like actually doing anything with the beast because we don't want to have to fight this and we don't want those people to get eaten we just want to go

[Speaker 2]
out the scene a little bit more travelers are under a caravan or wagon currently right

[Speaker 3]
that's correct i'm gonna place there well are they really because um if we've been out here

[Speaker 1]
for two days they'd be back by now these travelers just got attacked just now and they're they're not oh okay i meant i thought that was talking about our characters fell apart yeah yeah you see the

[Speaker 2]
bodies are actually that would be very funny you should do that oh my god no flight what does that

[Speaker 7]
mean what it says on the tomb i threw it how much does that trap away

[Speaker 3]
this is where kiwi's story ends how depends on how smart you guys are

[Speaker 7]
depending on how much the trap weighs we could be funny here uh snaz follows special rules

[Speaker 2]
yeah they be built quickly for the so i assume they're like light bulk and then you set them up

[Speaker 1]
if they can't be no flight that's where like after moving into that area the manticore can't like fly it's not going to be able to attack from above

[Speaker 3]
i think i vote we send hooch to set up the trap like down here

[Speaker 11]
uh yeah

[Speaker 3]
because hooch is sneaky that's where i was going with that um i looked at our our party skills which has a seven in stealth which may work there and an eight in crafting if that's needed

[Speaker 7]
it is probably best to get which just lay that trap but we are kind of sacrificing hooch

[Speaker 3]
no no we're not hooch is gonna come right back fine hooch is gonna come right back hooch is doing

[Speaker 5]
nothing but that and then coming back right there she's gonna set up a trap she's gonna

[Speaker 3]
activate it and it's gonna run run run run run run so uh trying to stealthily get back

[Speaker 7]
so you don't lead everyone to us it's the thing that activates the trap that gets the smell yeah so if hooch activates the trap i know we have to make the corpse well the yeah we we

[Speaker 3]
activate it far enough away where they can smell it but they still have to get there so if hooch is using that as a distraction and can like stealth away they'll be distracted by that instead of hooch and hooch can get back to us safely and the people in the caravan they're kind of you know we're giving them an opening they don't have to take the opening but they'd be smart to run

[Speaker 2]
you said there were corpses um sure and about here are they anyway that they just sold near the caravan they're all near the caravan

[Speaker 3]
does anyone have any summoning things so like we could summon a creature there it is not because if we can summon a creature to activate the snare that might i could summon 500

[Speaker 7]
toads doesn't that explicitly have enough toads to yes activate traps i would need to use the

[Speaker 2]
scrolls that we found but i could absolutely do that for us if i was to try and sneak up with hooch but i am not very sneaky

[Speaker 3]
well we don't want you to eat

[Speaker 7]
if the scroll is something i could cast i'm a little oh it is okay better it's sticking to

[Speaker 1]
the shadows what's um oh the man lets go of the woman's mouth for like one moment to scratch himself uh right as the manticore is like stepping particularly close to the to the carriage and she immediately lets out like a squeak

[Speaker 7]
way too fast

[Speaker 9]
okay let's go set up the trap ronald what's the range on toads

[Speaker 5]
how long does it take to uh set up traps is a minute

[Speaker 2]
uh i actually can't find anything for deploying a snare you need a snare kit

[Speaker 3]
uh creating the snare itself though right we'll have um or have mine let me see

[Speaker 1]
this oh it's victory points that's what i'm looking for okay yes so you want the victory point

[Speaker 2]
subsystem are you sure it's just an interact action to deploy a snare i can't find anything that says it isn't

[Speaker 3]
okay um why can't we just use a a thing like a an object to the goblin really there's got to be okay we got to just throw something at this fucking thing all right one of the corpses from the things that we just fought well we've traveled day like it's being like we have that be kind of smelly right now okay um kibbe's gonna throw kibbe's gonna give hooch these things just by the way these people

[Speaker 1]
like these people just got attacked barriers like 10 minutes ago oh

[Speaker 3]
kibbe's gonna give you her doll to use you can have you can have her doll she'll sacrifice you can have jizargo jizargo covered in scent and yeah viola is this the same fucking doll

[Speaker 7]
they're gonna recognize it immediately if it is if it's from the one session

[Speaker 3]
it's it's just her doll it has no backstory no history no nothing it's just something that i put in her inventory

[Speaker 7]
is there a separate doll that is the other one that kibbe took from the chest the lady beneath

[Speaker 1]
the carriage is crying try it silently as possible yes it is it is now go take jizargo and go

[Speaker 2]
yep i believe the plan is to set up a trap down here have the doll trigger it

[Speaker 3]
yeah throw the doll at the throw the doll at the trap trigger it have the scent like release all over it whatever and hopefully that works so

[Speaker 1]
doing that i would start use the map i think um uh health what is the range on it

[Speaker 3]
you know what it doesn't have a rain is here so we set up the yeah we want to set it up really stealthily which is why we're sending hooch stealthily set this trap up go into the tree line or wherever we are that you can't see throw the doll at it activate the doll or activate the thingy um the snare and then fucking stealth back don't run back stealth back all right but then what and then this thing this thing all of the this is an appetizing flavor smell local predators find delicious um such as like scent plans from animal prey blah blah um this thing will smell it and go for it hopefully if not then i i don't know what to

[Speaker 1]
do we're kind of this is the plan okay it will go for it it'll start moving towards it

[Speaker 7]
okay and now we take the whole party north

[Speaker 2]
yeah that gives them an opportunity to get the hell out uh that's not gonna dash for the caravan and drag both people out into the and move up to the canopy all right please make me a athletics yes um my sky bearer's belt gives me a benefit for like grappling and stuff can i use that for grappling these two people underneath the cart i i'm gonna have kiwi help you uh with one of the people because that's a very kiwi thing okay uh and could use help well if i'm using a hero point 29 there we go

[Speaker 1]
oh yeah you guys are good everyone else grabbed uh the lady is beginning to fuss again um kiwi's gonna keep well i was gonna have kiwi just

[Speaker 3]
bonk her but we're we're gonna keep a very furry hand over her mouth

[Speaker 1]
is anybody observing oh hi buddy is anybody observing the manticore at the moment

[Speaker 3]
um yeah

[Speaker 1]
all right make me a uh i guess sense motive will be kind of useful here or something akin to that

[Speaker 2]
for like figure out what it's like one inception check then yeah sense motive

[Speaker 3]
that's i don't want kiwi we want susudio i'm gonna put susudio on the map really quickly

[Speaker 1]
sense motive okay if you're all doing a given thing you guys get like one thing to do um during like a phase here if anybody would like to take back their action

[Speaker 3]
yeah oh yeah i'm gonna have uh you know susudio is gonna yeah

[Speaker 5]
okay cool thank you so hooch was gonna sit down the trap and uh be mindful of it and keep an eye on the manticore just in case anything happens um i believe he'll have like his blowgun ready with uh with the dart ready just in case yeah so hooch can tell that it i mean it's

[Speaker 1]
a doll it's not really holding its attention it seems really frustrated and increasingly angry that it can't find where the food is it just keeps like like bat the doll away and then sniff around and like bat the doll yeah this thing's probably going to go on a rampage soon

[Speaker 5]
i will note that neptune is aware of what he smells like and does use soap he does have soap

[Speaker 2]
is this manicore about to turn around and see no friend kiwi at the

[Speaker 1]
caravan is that what we're up to uh that depends on what the rest of the party is doing right now

[Speaker 7]
so phila is going to telekinetic hand on the doll and start moving it away southward oh you're still holding the doll no telekinetic hand 120 foot range hmm

[Speaker 1]
30 feet so you're gonna have to you gotta make a check to like really convincingly attract its attention or be stealthy yourself because you're gonna have to move up way closer

[Speaker 7]
she is going to try and be something herself to continue this that's not good please use your opening much better four points better we're very happy hopefully the circumstance is helping but i don't think it is

[Speaker 1]
no deuce it's drawing its attention uh significantly more now this works great for the cats let's try to look at the uh threshold thing is this so you will have another let's see you'll have basically another round's worth of of things to do in the meantime oh wait no no i don't have to do that at all i just think this thing to what make a perception check actually that was not successful the manticore is now sniffing detecting other scents scents and so there's nothing for it to chew on that also smells very nice it's gonna have to go one order down so now we're at sort of the next round of people being able to take actions as they wish

[Speaker 3]
all right so studio's gonna try to get to the no flight zone so that he does not get eaten

[Speaker 1]
all right and is he doing anything or is he just moving he's just moving there for the moment

[Speaker 3]
he's just moving there um i can't really think of anything else to do um kiwi will be dragging the person of course with her hand over her mouth that's what i was thinking all right so

[Speaker 1]
how do you want to uh she's struggling more and more now that the of the manticore is uh getting a little antsy um getting a little antsy just getting out of pocket uh she's struggling okay

[Speaker 3]
um claws are out they will go back in once this woman stops struggling oh you're trying to coerce or intimidate yes intimidate so coerce or intimidate which one tell us isn't intimidate

[Speaker 2]
yeah she said if it's true or not yeah it's just there's between like exploration

[Speaker 3]
um coerce okay

[Speaker 1]
okay okay all right so nova and kiwi are able to get to the no flight zone successfully there is still of course the trail but you are in the no flight zone

[Speaker 2]
we should get to the no flight zone and start a fire so it doesn't follow or something to stop it following us in rana's gonna dash great idea how green is this forest it would have fired

[Speaker 1]
i can just tell you right now a forest fire you would have a lot of difficulty just starting a forest fire here among other things it's an enchanted unicorn's forest we can use

[Speaker 2]
500 toads to distract it from following it you know what that's fair i would like to run i would like to run for the canopy is that a i think faster rather than slower is better just instead of stealthing we need to do like athletics to make the dash or stealth if you're trying to avoid it

[Speaker 1]
noticing it because right now it's attention is held by hooch or hooch and robin

[Speaker 7]
i'm not sure which one is it viola yeah sorry i have a lot of characters my bad

[Speaker 1]
so if you're trying to draw attention away from them then it's like all right whoever's whoever's not in the no flight zone with manticores is in trouble at the end

[Speaker 3]
of this um do i need to move the studio or is this just a it's happening kind of thing

[Speaker 1]
uh stealth trick that would be successful so you would not draw its attention and you would

[Speaker 3]
make it into the no flight zone okay all right so studio and then kiwi would also be there

[Speaker 2]
ronald trying stealth nine not good all right so you do

[Speaker 1]
uh you do draw its attention so it stops moving closer to viola and it stops moving closer to

[Speaker 2]
viola and um i know it'd be like somewhere between now the ship's iron and the canopy

[Speaker 1]
you are it's going to turn around and see you and your your failed stealth is going to be by then

[Speaker 7]
so now it's now it's going around here and kind of like pawing around now someone else under the caravan i don't know why i typed this caravan but it should be carriage

[Speaker 1]
all right it's it's time to use that damn scroll come on

[Speaker 2]
i agree but um can i can i do that now or do i need to wait until next round

[Speaker 1]
uh i'm gonna let somebody i'm gonna let somebody else interject briefly first

[Speaker 7]
feel is gonna try and take the opportunity to stealth around trying not to be the next snack success where's the thick canopy okay just taking the opportunity ronald has made

[Speaker 3]
how's hooch doing hooch is uh good

[Speaker 7]
he's gonna stay there

[Speaker 5]
slowly getting there if he moves fast it means he uh he breaks still

[Speaker 2]
so he's slowly crawling up this is i think this is more of a like free form thing where like the manticore is distracted you can probably get to the canopy with like one more stealth yeah

[Speaker 1]
it's just are you making a check like we're testing for victory points here

[Speaker 5]
i mean i'm slowly going out there something depends on how quick i can do out there without

[Speaker 3]
breaking stuff it's just yeah roll stealth to see if it works yeah if he breaks so if you run

[Speaker 1]
then you break stealth if you run and you do it successfully then you break stealth and and draw attention away from the and draw attention of the manticore while getting to your location so the other person gets something to do if you just stealth up then you're good but if you if you fail

[Speaker 5]
oh yeah i just want to stop up yeah nice and slowly taking my time

[Speaker 1]
all right so you do get there successfully manticore is pretty impatient at this point

[Speaker 2]
it is time for some toads if that is okay

[Speaker 1]
i'm gonna have it make a swipe against you with a multi-attack penalty

[Speaker 2]
give me cover i would make more sense what is the i'd have plus one ac plus four so i guess it's

[Speaker 1]
yeah give it a minus four all right it has a multi-attack penalty of minus four for its second attack so that'll be that'll be perfect yeah that's perfect

[Speaker 3]
he's a titan wrestler

[Speaker 7]
i i think it is the worst idea right now to try and run up and wrestle it

[Speaker 2]
that is a crit

[Speaker 7]
and a shield block

[Speaker 2]
no

[Speaker 1]
before this happens did anybody not do did anybody not take their action or do anything

[Speaker 2]
uh nova didn't no can nova do intimidate to try and scare it off

[Speaker 1]
uh the consequences of failure will be if this this goes to nova instead

[Speaker 7]
yes she would love that okay that's a crit what the fuck just gotta just gotta convince it that we're less worth going for than the corpses already here um nova will use her new feature

[Speaker 2]
that she got at level three um she'll turn into her only form to make herself big to like try and

[Speaker 1]
scare it off it does scare it off uh it will it will grab two of the horse corpses and

[Speaker 3]
and bounce oh my god kibi is absolutely in love with nova now get out of here you're right

[Speaker 2]
very good we still have our 500 toads what a win i just want to see how all that and we

[Speaker 7]
didn't even spend one of the toads

[Speaker 1]
haha

[Speaker 2]
rana's unconscious but nova can grab her or can that hit be directed at nova

[Speaker 1]
uh yeah they'll be directed at nova she'll take the crit easy

[Speaker 2]
whoops that was still applied to rana i'm just gonna apply 32 damage to nova

[Speaker 7]
that's a nasty hit two crits in a row that's awesome

[Speaker 2]
she just takes the hit and doesn't even falter then like scares it off

[Speaker 1]
very good all right and what do you victory points to for xp

[Speaker 2]
uh you i typically you give it like an encounter like a worth of like xp so if it's like a severe encounter which i would argue this is it would just give us the severe xp yeah so i mean if we now kill the medical we get double xp no it's one encounter yeah that's what i said if we attack it's time to encounter so an extreme uh encounter is 160 xp

[Speaker 1]
which is party level plus four so maybe it's not i add that's weird that's interesting so when i add the manticore it says um award 106 xp is 106 x uh four out of six party members we've got six party members that sounds right yeah but it says four it's it's weird like uh

[Speaker 2]
oh i'm not sure um

[Speaker 1]
it's weird it's um no i could be just a consequence of using different uh party levels nope she's tied yeah so budget 160 at 180 xp party level two

[Speaker 11]
um oh seriously this

[Speaker 1]
what does it show me manticore what the hell ah because the yeah there you go so party if the party size is six and the level is two then the xp award the encounter cost is 160 and i think it's just you have additional people over four yep so it drags down the xp a little bit

[Speaker 2]
but would it get doubled to those at level one

[Speaker 1]
do we have anybody a little longer oh we do and the studio yeah a little frog pyre i just do seems to work and beautiful very nice thank you thank you anybody who was like still stuck out there wasn't going to be a combat encounter i was just going to fly away with you oh my god i'm just gonna fly away with

[Speaker 2]
two of you how strong is the manticore like challenge right it'll be level five or something oh we maybe could have beat it uh probably not you guys took a level five uh previously

[Speaker 1]
which was nice and impressive you had an easy time of it though

[Speaker 2]
was that the what was that the tune jam jelly i think yeah we didn't beat it though it left we survived against it for two rounds you're right and we also had that fucked bow that you gave bar i think it did a lot of the heavy lifting because it had the weakness no because bar

[Speaker 1]
bar missed like a fuck no because that one didn't have a weakness cold iron

[Speaker 2]
oh it didn't nope i don't know then not the tomb jelly just over things again

[Speaker 7]
remind me to get a hunk of cold iron from viola's

[Speaker 2]
needles that's literally in what the session report i'm writing up from rana's perspective

[Speaker 1]
shit that's really funny though all right and that's convenient so we are going to i'm going to attempt to run this at the same time tomorrow evening and conveniently this is the end of the trail that goes to the spider that goes to the false widow hollow

[Speaker 2]
hopefully i can um join in towards the end i know me and my fiancee are going to look at a wedding venue and i think she wants a nail done yeah we got engaged in january oh uh i've mentioned it but um i didn't outright say

[Speaker 2]

[Speaker 5]
perth is off the side of the country oh good good good good you're safe perth is the uh

[Speaker 3]
the left side we're in the right you're safe what's in perth

[Speaker 1]
i think well what's it's about what's going to be in perth i think we just leaked another uh war plan recently about perth from orbit

[Speaker 2]
yeah uh east coast would be fine if you did that yeah there you go

[Speaker 1]
i'm my large repertoire of australian friends i had i have one buddy actually he was he was a new zealander but had uh but he lived in australia and he was perpetually homeless and like no occasionally would like make like earth ships and stuff like that he he had a very interesting life but he spent most of his time in perth i just remember thinking that was like the perfect place for him based on everything that he told me it is a 41 hour

[Speaker 5]
drive from my place to perth oh my god that's 3 800 kilometers uh which is about i don't know

[Speaker 7]
3 000 miles jesus you're basically in a band in the middle of uh the one place that we know you

[Speaker 1]
are now if you were to do the math yeah me going to me driving back to new jersey from texas is uh is like 1400 miles for for reference and only about like uh 24 hours i think total

[Speaker 3]
maybe it's less i need to look at an actual scaled map good lord

[Speaker 7]
there you go from east to west in canada a few oh god almost 10 years ago now uh that took five full days geez

[Speaker 2]
i thank you for running this session james that was a lot of fun thank you for playing

[Speaker 1]
i did take off tonight which was my boss was fine with because i worked extra last night he's very flexible with like my schedule which is great and as long as our numbers look good it's fantastic and that's your work from home job no no this is the this is the one that i work from uh now my work from home job is now trying to like get me to do more hours it's like well can i call you in for like two hours in the middle of the day i'm like yeah you can you can call me absolutely i'll never jeff it never hurts to ask it's what um what is the industry of your new job the new so you're like an assistant manager yeah yeah i'm an assistant manager i'm in operations uh operations supervisor operations manager so it's it's uh well they're like you know what line scooters are right i don't know if they have those like it's an electric bike company you scan it on your phone all these companies work the same oh yeah yeah and so we have uh it's called veo has a contract with texas a&m which is the big university and college station and functionally like the powerhouse of the town like the power the center of power in the town this town has like nothing except for texas a&m uh that's particularly important like it is the college the town is the college so so we have a uh and we actually things got a little nerve wracking there they were not happy with us because apparently our division or our team had just been getting constant constant constant cuts so like funding and budget and and vehicles and stuff like that fleet you know refurbishments parts and so they the vp came in along with a regional manager vp of the company like uh last week or maybe it was two it was like uh the 14th and so i got to meet them in person i had just started training and they introduced texas a&m their leadership for uh the sustainable transportation just going back and forth about like oh here are all the problems we're having but but but it's like 15 minutes and like here's why we want to make sure that you know that we are serious we are getting rid of this this this this these things that you uh and then they were our team's response with the vp and stuff was like listen we already have a plan and they were happy you know now the mood is good because i'm in here but the meeting was nerve-wracking because they introduced me like after 15 minutes they're like oh this is james uh he's here to fix all the problems that you just mentioned jeez yes uh but then i really hit the ground running

[Speaker 7]
no it's great anything about this bugging you it's his fault now what's up

[Speaker 1]
sorry i'm just commenting on it oh no no like that's uh like yeah no if it's wrong now it's gonna be my fault it's just yeah exactly it's just it's just night shift mostly what i've been doing is just like working as a technician um to catch up which has been which has been great because i get to i get to learn i want to be able to if i can't like learn what the guys are doing then they're not going to like respect me respect my authority and so i've just been doing that and it's helped us catch up the numbers because i'm you know i'm good at it that's that's it

[Speaker 2]
it sounds good though it sounds like a healthy workplace compared to your work from home job

[Speaker 1]
no the work from home job is so like it's i don't know like that one lady heather is her name co-worker just constantly fucking with me like during my shifts like calling calling my boss while he's at like a giants game right he's sitting behind the fucking pitcher he's sitting behind the fucking umpire watching the game and she's calling him to be like james is missing all these calls and blah blah blah blah it's like no no i'm not it's like we need to bring in these people just so we could look at this thing and like i'm doing well at the work from home job because they finally spent more on advertising there's more people for me to sell to but like yep they're just misbehaving constantly

[Speaker 2]
and i have it's cool that they let you take today off though yeah sure numbers are good like

[Speaker 1]
it's there's all you've done your hours or whatever yeah yeah there's always another technician who wants hours or something like that wants to be able to spend a little bit more time uh because the current om uh for the daytime has has fostered that kind of environment so if if i ever well you know schedules are really flexible i could be like i'm gonna do six hours tonight i'm gonna do eight hours tonight and if i do eight hours it normally turns into like 10 hours but but it's money that means if i've got like a big day the next day with like the work from home job i get to relax a little bit more yeah it's cool that's nice

[Speaker 2]
um yeah i will let you know when i know what i'm doing tomorrow typical uh husband of not knowing what's going on for his own wedding in my defense though it's not for like at least a year

[Speaker 1]
yeah no there's nothing like that man i was so surprised the unicorn is like uh uh cr3

[Speaker 2]
when you said that they never was like very close to asking if she can like earn the unicorn but when you said they were like um like respect and stuff is how they go it was like you probably shouldn't ask to earn the living sentient creature yeah that would have gone a little rough i'm not own she wanted to like be friends with it and ride it but that's probably just as dehumanizing

[Speaker 1]
the language of own would have been

[Speaker 2]
no no it wouldn't have been just if it's very anti-slavery she wouldn't want to enslave the sentient uh well any creature really um that is one of her edicts

[Speaker 1]
very good

[Speaker 3]
oh man that's very funny dude the oni form that is awesome yeah

[Speaker 2]
to be big it's like it's sort of like the barbarian one but uh yeah a giant instinct

[Speaker 3]
um that's what kibi is

[Speaker 2]
we the biggest marshals are when you get that oh my god nova and kibi have to be besties hell yeah

[Speaker 3]
oh yeah um so kibi still has that spell from you know her first go around here is that is there an equivalent thing here in pathfinder uh what spell are you talking about it was a custom spell that made kibi big like really really big like like attack on titan big um but she could only cast it once and she doesn't know how to reverse it

[Speaker 2]
there is a spell that lets you turn into a kaiju i think it would be similar to that hmm uh kaiju that's the kaiju stance which is a monk stance but that only makes you large um i think this kaiju form i think it's a druid spell typically but uh there is a level 20 feet for druids that have the monstrosity wild shape form where they become a kaiju what is it kaiju kaiju is like godzilla like enemies in pacific rim yeah like the big world ending monsters that the american government will coolly defeat with their max yes nature incarnates the spell um and there is the wild shape version of uh with which is the fate because wild shape and this is built around you take fates to do it which i really like you be really good at wild shape i think a lot of kaiju would be closer to a irreversibly big kibi please tell kaiju k-a-i-j-u oh okay

[Speaker 3]
that's easy does this one change your size oh my god wait is that a fucking godzilla excuse me i like the idea of kibi being like basically cursed by her own like what is the word i with hubris i'm looking for i don't know just her own desire to be like fucking massive she gets cursed and is just this giant monster now like that's her legend that's where her story ends or begins i don't know

[Speaker 2]
there's actually a second book to uh like a second uh section to chill mist valley where they have to kill this monstrous cat walk that has arrived in the valley

[Speaker 3]
she's like really friendly and loves everybody she just can't like tell anybody because everybody wants to kill her because she keeps accidentally stepping on people

[Speaker 7]
does armor inventor get anything that has some increased of size but no maybe because if they do we have a fight on our hands

[Speaker 1]
that is so that is so weird and also really cool it's a charm that makes it building stronger oh um i mean chomas valley the the way it originally ends is you're fighting a giant crab uh aberration cthulhu monster

[Speaker 2]
so oh so it's just that episode of futurama where uh zoidberg fights bender as a kaiju

[Speaker 3]
what the fuck this is a last resort spell for kiwi um she would only use it if there was no other option and it was to save her people i'm sorry enlarge is heightened at

[Speaker 7]
sixth level is you can make up the 10 willing creatures huge

[Speaker 2]
that is exactly what i was about to say there goes another neighborhood we're jerked nothing can stop a monster that big nothing

[Speaker 3]
except nine other people a chance to try out my external alongside her

[Speaker 7]
but we'll need a ten of us are becoming huge

[Speaker 3]
the new the 10 titans of sim aid two meals in one week

[Speaker 1]
friends help a guinea pig tricked me so now zoidberg is big huh that's more like it who's intimidating who now big city

[Speaker 2]
hello mr chase manhattan is here

[Speaker 3]
we finished up we're just kind of cutting the shit fair seeing how big we can get

[Speaker 9]
i think i saw reddit about that specific topic uh be specific i don't pass one to one oh just trying to get large i mean if you start off as one of the large creatures like you're already pretty up there

[Speaker 5]
i don't know why did you get up to colossal size and it was amazing

[Speaker 9]
there is a maximum like cap now like what is it what's the size maximum because they got rid of them huge yeah they got rid of like minuscule and i want to say they got rid of gargantuan

[Speaker 2]
gargantuan exists still but it's like an abstract sort of like size category compared to the others which is why the larger size character can typically be as a colossal

[Speaker 3]
is that technically what this spell would take kiwi to

[Speaker 2]
well and two we've got gargantuan now so like any of those kaiju spells or features would get you to

[Speaker 9]
gargantuan i know at level 20 there's like the avatar spell which makes you pretty big as well i have the idea is it only large i think it might only be large on the god

[Speaker 2]
i have to tell us huge assuming a huge battle form

[Speaker 3]
oh okay that needs to be the one then and it's only that one i think that's a cleric only yeah this is a level spell well keep is a uh barbarian so she technically wouldn't be able to do any spells um but this is a custom spell that this would be like a a thing brought over from the other game because this is her knowledge of how to do this right i'm just assuming that she can have it on this in this as well it's also a last resort because she will be unplayable your words so

[Speaker 2]
you're doing that i think it would be like the 20th level druid feet

[Speaker 3]
yeah this would be like a one-time thing and then kiwi becomes a legend that's that's it that's where her story ends until somebody can figure out how to

[Speaker 9]
reverse the curse i mean she can also just get big as a giant barbarian yeah just not that big

[Speaker 2]
um get the weapon or gives your weapon a reach of like 100 feet or something what the fuck

[Speaker 3]
but if like all of the if everybody in the party is going down and there's no way to save any of them her entire plan is to just use this spell get big kill the creature and save her friends

[Speaker 7]
you can't flank with extending because it only extends it for the strike yeah well you can flank with somebody else with extending

[Speaker 2]
yeah the extending room you activate it for two actions and then you can strike with your last action with a range of like i don't think there is a strike as part of the two actions oh it's like lunge i see yeah

[Speaker 9]
my favorite part about pathfinder i was trying to figure out how i do a lady godiva character and then i was debating if james would let me what is it a lady godiva character i don't know who that is so yeah she's the lady that rode around naked on a horse

[Speaker 1]
any anything else about you know i don't need to know anymore that's fine

[Speaker 9]
okay yeah she would run horses to protest taxing accurate and detailed uh character art please

[Speaker 2]
that's if i did that i would get rid of taxes entirely

[Speaker 7]
running around a horse naked to protest yeah that'd be like what class is this

[Speaker 2]
bard maybe like get this man out of here

[Speaker 9]
increase the taxes just give what he wants um i'm pretty sure rahiki if you load it with poison it just it lasts until you use it i think that was the conclusion we came to

[Speaker 2]
yeah i think that's what we did oh that was like seven yeah

[Speaker 9]
oh that's because this is the the game channel that no one uses yes

[Speaker 2]
you could be like a lady godiva could be like a life curse um see i was debating between oracle

[Speaker 9]
and witch um because the lady godiva that i remember from my youth had super long hair and witches have the ability to move their hair i wish they have you could do a good hair build i would love to have like a a melee hair build um you can kind of get away with it with um archetypes there's um changelings can move their hair as well um but yeah i don't actually feel like i ever look into how to make a character big though if anything i usually try and make my characters as small as possible and that's easy because most of them can just start small i'd love to do like a monk

[Speaker 2]
i'd love to do a monk which because it'd just be shantae off genie games where you punch people with your hair that's all i want in life a hair punching maybe i do a summoner and i flavor my either one is my hair this is true flavor is free need a hair idol one

[Speaker 7]
there we go i think a suli monk would be the best way to do shantae probably yeah don't you have a scimitar sometimes hmm am i completely fucking off my rocks

[Speaker 2]
maybe that's like a dozen games

[Speaker 11]
hey i called this city quit touching my stuff tell it to the claw bite my colossal metal ass so

[Speaker 5]
Who wants lobster bisque?

[Speaker 9]
Hey Bender, want to make shrinky dinks?

[Speaker 10]
Bad? Well, it's not excellent, I didn't win the lottery, so it's kind of okay. It'll be excellent when I don't die.

No, dying could be excellent. Depends how it happens.

[Speaker 4]
That's what I'm saying. I got two gold to buy items. What do I buy?

Assume I have nothing.

[Speaker 1]
A lot of ammunition.

[Speaker 2]
That way if you find a gun, you're set.

[Speaker 5]
A backpack to hold all your stuff you don't have.

[Speaker 7]
Perhaps armor.

[Speaker 4]
I have armor and a weapon.

[Speaker 5]
How much does two cost you?

[Speaker 4]
Everything but two gold. What?

[Speaker 2]
Your armor adventurer's pack is one and a half.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, that is good.

[Speaker 2]
That comes with some food and stuff.

[Speaker 5]
There's the quick kit, depending on your class. But I don't think that's built in the Foundry, I think it's only in Pathbuilder. Maelstrom.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you can just look through what's in the Pathbuilder kit and then get it.

[Speaker 9]
You get food in an hour.

[Speaker 2]
If you've bought armor and a weapon, though, you probably don't need to. Usually I'll just suggest an adventurer's pack and an item relevant to the class. Like a crowbar.

Useful item.

[Speaker 3]
We have gotten quite a lot of use out of crowbars.

[Speaker 1]
Compasses. Compassi.

[Speaker 2]
I really like the fate that just lets you retroactively buy something.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, that is so fun. That's pretty good.

[Speaker 2]
Esha gets that for free with her background.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that's awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Which is very strong.

[Speaker 5]
Is it that pearlescent planner thing?

[Speaker 1]
I think somebody stole my good phone charger at work. Fuck, he's onto me. Actually left it there.

[Speaker 2]
I'd cry if my good phone charger got stolen. I spent like a hundred dollars on that thing.

[Speaker 1]
I'm having a similar emotional reaction where I'm going to start speculating on their race, how old they are. I'm going to get really in my head about it and nasty. I'm not going to do that.

Mostly because I already know who did it. I think. Maybe it's gotten to me already.

[Speaker 2]
Post their address. We'll go see.

[Speaker 1]
Instead of a session, let's go for a house call. That's the problem. Problem number one.

Maybe they need it more than me. No, they don't. There's a billion phone chargers in that place.

There's a billion USB-C chargers in that place.

[Speaker 2]
They don't have an address. They don't even have somewhere to charge their phone. They probably don't need it more than you.

Then again, phones are kind of essential. Charge it anywhere.

[Speaker 1]
It could be an exterior outlet. What are you crying for? You get fed at 6 a.m. every morning. What?

[Speaker 3]
Is your cat yelling at you?

[Speaker 2]
Ava, how do I go about looking for Levent?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, my God.

[Speaker 11]
Boo.

[Speaker 4]
I love that they left a card with the person they were looking for.

[Speaker 2]
They did. Like, hi, I think I got a business card for someone perfect to hunt down this cat folk. Hang on.

That is the person who robbed me.

[Speaker 3]
That one sponsored meme where he's just, like, wanted and he's looking for himself.

[Speaker 2]
Just have to follow the trail of business cards back to Levent.

[Speaker 5]
Is there catnip in this world?

[Speaker 3]
I think that's just drugs, Matt.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. There is, actually. There was my one IRL.

No, no, well, technically, there was, like, a mini campaign and then there was another IRL campaign on the other side of the planet, which Landy's more familiar with. And I was trying to figure out a way to fit in cat folk. My buddy Dennis played one, so I was like, all right, there's, like, a near-extinct branch of goblinoids.

And then did go extinct on that part of the planet. And catnip was involved quite a few times.

[Speaker 4]
Don't worry, you just gotta kill the person giving the bounty before the bounty is claimed.

[Speaker 2]
I don't actually want to kill Levent. I just want to find them and talk. If you'll refer to Maya's dislikes, you'll see cops there.

[Speaker 1]
All right, I'm going to wait, like, another four minutes to see if Miss Frogetha makes it over here and to look for my charger. You're doing this yourself.

[Speaker 2]
Are we missing someone else?

[Speaker 1]
Frogetha said that you might show.

[Speaker 2]
Well, there's four of us, and then there's GM. Okay, no, I'm just stupid. Glad we've re-established this.

[Speaker 1]
There's that robber. And then we'll begin.

[Speaker 2]
So long, token land.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea where you guys have been for the past week. I don't think that anybody did. Any football?

That's a good question. I hope nobody's been doing earn income in this town. Because there's no income to be earned here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, well, someone keeps offering me money to acquire children for them, so I just keep doing it. That's fine, right? Using Underworld lore, yeah?

No, I did research. Who is the Candyman? Did we get enough research points for us to collectively discover anything useful?

[Speaker 1]
That's the problem. I don't know if anybody else did do research.

[Speaker 11]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
I did research. I told Janeth to do it, and she's like, why do I even do earn income if I can't use this skill? I'm like, well, you could look for a job that uses that skill, and also you could just take skills that let you do earn income.

[Speaker 2]
The thing that pissed me off the most about that is that they didn't read the fact that I said that that's performance, not religion.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, obviously. It's like, well, I could just be doing something else that's religion. You could be, and there's a hitherto established procedure for that, so that I don't have to declare what jobs are available all the time.

You could spend a day or two looking for it. And if successful, then we could say that there is a job available for the skill that you want. It might be non-standard in some way.

It might be of a higher or lower level. It might have a set time that it takes. Maybe there's a year's worth of writing scrolls for the local church, sure.

But the unwillingness to even roll for it is like, what are you doing, man? Come on.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I like the player searching for it, but it's like, I want to preach my god at the temple. And it's like, buddy, is your god even the same god? Are these people even going to like you preaching their god at their temple?

You're going to get divine smited, bro. It's like the dissonance. It's like, you can do these things.

You just need to do other things to get to them. And it's always, people say, no, I don't want to do that. Fucking wood armor.

Fuck that shit, bro. Give it to me.

[Speaker 1]
You're a great player, Dylan. That was the first thing I did, but I didn't even look. I didn't even look at the other fucking, at the armors available or anything like that.

I found my charger, by the way. The person I was speculating about, by the way, was half white, half Irish.

[Speaker 2]
Classic Irish shit. That's why they all ended up in Australia.

[Speaker 1]
Approximately 28 years of age. That's why they were either shipped off to Australia or slaves in America.

[Speaker 2]
My, um, my... My ancestor, one of them got sent to Australia because he was fencing horses. You can look it up, there's reports of it.

[Speaker 1]
Now, I lived on a horse farm, and while horses are awfully dexterous, I struggle to imagine one holding a rapier. Though, I can imagine that the money would be good. If it was successful, it would be very entertaining.

And would fetch a nice price for tickets. No, you mean fencing as like he was stealing them? Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Although, horses that make fences would be, I think, arguably worth more.

[Speaker 1]
I was thinking about fencing like the sport with the rapiers.

[Speaker 4]
Well, that's why unicorns are no longer extinct, because they all got died out fencing. I didn't even think of that.

[Speaker 2]
Imagine how well a horse could drive a fence post into the ground, though.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, if we could have trained ours to do that. I mean, could they really hoof a post down?

[Speaker 4]
What was that, sorry? I don't think they'd really be able to hoof a fence down and post in, would they?

[Speaker 2]
But imagine if they could stand on two legs and do it, you know? Like the full body weight of a horse, sending it down. They'd probably break their legs, they'd need horse tools.

[Speaker 11]
Like the cow tools pictures.

[Speaker 1]
That's... yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Why hasn't the session started on time while Andy was talking about cow tools again?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, drop yourselves on the green, because I don't think... Except for, um... Oh yeah, everybody drop yourselves on the green.

[Speaker 2]
Holy shit, McCannon's here. I need to add myself to the party folder.

[Speaker 1]
Is McCannon here? Oh, McCannon's here. McCannon's in the party folder, let me move him out.

[Speaker 2]
Trying to leech her XP, the bastard.

[Speaker 1]
I wanted to stay for longer last night, I was like, oh...

[Speaker 3]
It's alright, you still got the full XP more or less.

[Speaker 1]
And I have a quest lead now too, which is fucking awesome.

[Speaker 2]
James, what level is this adventure?

[Speaker 1]
I feel like I should stop answering that question for anything that's outside the tutorial zone. I respect that answer. Oh, it's a person named Ranger.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Now it's Durango.

[Speaker 1]
Rank.

[Speaker 2]
Shut up.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so who's in the party today, who did research, who did what? That's very important to me right now.

[Speaker 4]
We did research what?

[Speaker 2]
There was homework? Esha did research. We're not doing Candyland, are we?

We are. We're doing Candyland both today and the session later. Esha did a occultism research, she rolled an 18.

That's for like, I don't know, haunts and stuff I guess. Very good. She wanted to learn what the Candyman was.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the doctor did research on how to reverse the whole disappearing town effect so that they could find the church and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, who did what?

[Speaker 3]
Dr. Basia did research on how to reverse the disappearing town effect.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basia did research on that, and what was Dr. Basia's roll?

[Speaker 3]
Let me double check.

[Speaker 2]
Did you lose it to when the bot didn't save our commands?

[Speaker 3]
No, I feel like I resubmitted it. I think you resubmitted it as well. Give me a moment.

[Speaker 1]
I'm checking the proper database. It's not going to be on the website right now, but I am checking the proper database.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll just scroll through Foundry and see if I get there first.

[Speaker 1]
I'll check the deployment log as well just in case.

[Speaker 9]
I have one for common for earn income.

[Speaker 3]
Is that the only one that went through?

[Speaker 1]
It depends on when you did it.

[Speaker 3]
I did submit one after when you said one should probably do that. It was a 22. Okay.

I think. Hold on. I need to make sure it's actually.

[Speaker 1]
There's Minaya.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, it was a 22.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you didn't redo your Dr. Basia one. What's the only thing?

[Speaker 11]
22?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's totally fine. Alright, so that's going to be partial success. I'm going to have you guys place yourselves in the green pretty please.

And we're going to get ready for a combat here. Actually, you don't have to place yourselves in the green. I'm going to make a new green.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Depending on where you guys want to go. So there are enemies sort of patrolling. Trying to hunt down people, of course.

Towards the southern area in the forest. There's another group that's up. That's up the north.

In the midst of the buildings. And there's one final group that is actually coming down. From the hilltop where the church is supposed to be.

Coming down from that trail. And you could meet. If you pushed, you could meet any of these three groups.

Before the other ones noticed.

[Speaker 2]
I don't really have a preference on which one we try and get first.

[Speaker 4]
Should I come on Coogee? Because I was on Coogee last time.

[Speaker 3]
If you want. There's also the one that's in the 11 hours.

[Speaker 8]
Are they both?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so there are three groups. Can you repeat what we're supposed to do?

[Speaker 1]
Three enemy groups. You can scout them out. You can try to meet them.

You can try to attack them. Sneak by them, of course. At the moment they are.

So there's one to the north. There's one to the south. There's one that's coming into the town square.

The stakes are that. The ones that are coming down to the town square and aren't just patrolling. If they spot you guys, then they're probably going to call the other two groups for reinforcements.

The one coming down from the hill is the largest.

[Speaker 3]
It's probably best to divide and conquer then.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should go for the big group. That way we can get them before they get to reinforcements.

[Speaker 3]
Fair enough. Alright. We'll do that.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone have anything against killing them? I would like to.

[Speaker 5]
We could take them alive for questioning.

[Speaker 3]
This isn't the pursuit of greater life-saving, so the doctor doesn't mind. Yes, he would be iffy about it, but it's also like, well... Worst comes to worst.

[Speaker 2]
Can we try and ambush them? If that's possible?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Be able to be over in these trees as they approach?

[Speaker 5]
So who's taking what exploration activity?

[Speaker 1]
I think right now you guys are just ambushing. If you have an exploration activity that you think is going to be beneficial to you, you could absolutely do so. But yeah, if you want to move in for the...

You could absolutely use stealth for your initiative.

[Speaker 2]
The enemy makes stealth moves first, though, right? No, so when you take the sneak or whatever travel action, it just means you get to roll initiative with stealth. If you beat their perception, then they don't notice you.

[Speaker 11]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
So really it only matters when combat could happen? Oh, when you say ambush, then...

[Speaker 3]
And seek does give a bonus to initiative.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, I was saying, it's either seek or search that gives you a bonus to initiative.

[Speaker 4]
Scout.

[Speaker 3]
Scout, that's the one. Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
I've got scout on.

[Speaker 5]
So I've got scout. There's a travel on mount action. Can Tig take that?

[Speaker 7]
Ha ha.

[Speaker 5]
Don't know what it does. Nah, he'll take the defend action.

[Speaker 3]
So the ones moving down are these ones. I will also go hide in the trees then. Hello, Asher.

[Speaker 4]
Hello. I feel concerned because I have a gun. Ha ha ha.

[Speaker 3]
You had a gun? What happened?

[Speaker 4]
I have a gun.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you have? The good news is not all Fae, or not all anybody, is excited to always just rush towards gunfire.

[Speaker 5]
Anybody here an expert in stealth?

[Speaker 3]
Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Nope. That's a bummer. I have no one to follow.

[Speaker 3]
Were you going to do follow the leader activity?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Eh. Oh well. It is a little funny to think that a whole centaur is hiding in the trees as well.

[Speaker 1]
That does bring me some joy.

[Speaker 5]
I'm using my legs to pretend I'm four tiny saplings who have a bush covering the rest of me.

[Speaker 2]
Well, even if my stealth roll is bad, at least the others aren't rolling stealth, so... Ha ha. Makes me a less appealing target.

[Speaker 1]
I sent you macros. Wait, what's... Sorry, what did you say?

Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I chose to do stealth as my exploration action, and the others... I think I had a ray shield in there. So even if I roll bad on my stealth, I'll be slightly less obvious than the centaur.

And the ranger, excellent. What was Dr. Vasha doing?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you know. Scout.

[Speaker 2]
Also not hiding, excellent. Everyone else dies.

[Speaker 1]
So, how does the stealth work exactly for you getting...

[Speaker 2]
I pinned it to the... Wait, let me have a look at it. So, I...

If I beat the perception DC with my stealth initiative roll, I am undetected. My stealth initiative roll was 11, so they would need a perception of 1 to beat that.

[Speaker 3]
I'm good, I'll do stealth then.

[Speaker 2]
Well, they unfortunately... I think they rolled a 2. Well, this is their DC, so it's whatever their modifier is plus 10.

So, I probably didn't beat their stealth, so that means I start the combat observed. They can see me, they can attack me.

[Speaker 3]
My stealth is the exact same bonus as my perception, so...

[Speaker 5]
Let's see how quiet I can be.

[Speaker 2]
Well, no, you don't get to stealth and do something else. Oh, that's not a good news. One exploration action.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine, we can all be seen. All is well.

[Speaker 1]
This one I will roll in secret. This one's supposed to be chat. I fucking love loot macros.

This is excellent. There's still people.

[Speaker 2]
The rolls were secret, but we saw the results of them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sweet. Even better. Well, you were going to see some of them anyway, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
So, we don't know what they mean to roll.

[Speaker 1]
Has somebody not added themselves to initiative?

[Speaker 6]
No, it's a 1. Setting it to 1. Dr. Basha, you are up.

[Speaker 3]
Hello. Oh, it is me. Okay.

I guess we're blowing these guys up. Give me a second. We're just going to do this one.

Worked well for each effect as well. So, that's the turn. Doing the 3 action one.

Sorry, the 2 turn one.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. Holy moly.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
Bringing us to Ranger.

[Speaker 4]
Ranger? Gosh, I'm going to give my character gen 5 after this.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Give me a second to get logged back in.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm going to hero fight that.

[Speaker 5]
I think I have to kick him out of the game while I'm signed back in.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'm going to aim a gun at it and go pow. Very good.

And, I believe that should be AOE. It is.

[Speaker 1]
Are you sure? Does it have like splash damage?

[Speaker 4]
Yes. When activated, the reservoir of alchemical agents impact on the energy ceiling, doing 1 persistent untyped acid-cold electric fire of poison damage and 1 splash damage.

[Speaker 1]
I don't see persistent damage on there, but obviously they take splash damage. So, if it's 1 splash damage, then it would be less than 1 splash damage.

[Speaker 9]
Very good.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
So, it should do 1 persistent acid damage. You're going to have to add that yourself, but take your actions first, and then you can put that in the chat, and they'll be able to add it.

[Speaker 4]
And then, I'm going to reload, and I'm going to shoot again. And I'm going to reload it with a fire bullet. Heh heh heh.

[Speaker 11]
Bruh. Oh, that's my turn. Ugh.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, actually. Yeah, sorry. Okay.

Teague!

[Speaker 9]
Hey, alright, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
Teague!

[Speaker 5]
Hello?

[Speaker 9]
It's your turn!

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. So, the ranger fired?

[Speaker 1]
He did. No stalling. What have you got for us?

[Speaker 5]
I will move up here. Since I have a reach weapon, I will... Ready an action to attack anybody that attacks our loud friend.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Is that the end of your turn? He's done.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Oh, yeah, the glitches worked out.

[Speaker 1]
Let's start off with something funny. That's magnificent. That's absolutely fantastic.

I was trying to figure out what kind of loot can I give, like, troops? Like, what could I possibly give them that would, like, make any kind of sense or whatever? Right?

It hit me. Bombs! Alright, so you just take a speed penalty and immobilize.

Can I drag the... Oh, it's amazing.

[Speaker 2]
Isn't it just? They're gonna move.

[Speaker 1]
Forming up and the like. Choose... Figure I would get this one by now.

Forms up as a free action to condense into a 20x20. To its speed. Its speed is, what, 25?

[Speaker 8]
So that guy moves there.

[Speaker 1]
It first forms up as a free action. I see, I see. Does it get rid of my...

I wonder if it gets rid of my bombs after I roll them. Or attack with them.

[Speaker 8]
Let's find out.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, this is plus 6, because it's the second attack. Versus Aisha is... I missed.

And I've just added persistent damage to our boys there. They're no longer bleeding. Let's get rid of that.

No, I do not want to end the encounter. I want to end the turn. Aisha!

[Speaker 2]
I spend three actions charging Horizon Thundersphere also. Yes.

[Speaker 8]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Just gotta survive till next turn and cast it. Dark Abashi.

[Speaker 3]
Speaking of next turn... Guess what, gang?

[Speaker 2]
Wizard time.

[Speaker 8]
Thundersphere!

[Speaker 3]
Attack.

[Speaker 1]
Splendid. Absolutely nothing.

[Speaker 3]
And then...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that was almost a crit fail.

[Speaker 3]
It is also the additional... The 2d6 is the splash damage, so to speak.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so that's minus an additional 2. I gotta figure out which one of these squares is the main... That's one that's on initiative, so I have to delete one of these squares.

[Speaker 2]
Are the 2d6 as well as area damage? If they have a weakness to area damage, it probably didn't trigger properly.

[Speaker 1]
It didn't. I had to add an additional 2 damage. Wait, no, area damage, not splash damage.

So that's even more damaging for them.

[Speaker 3]
So that would be, what, 21 in total?

[Speaker 1]
More, 24.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, awesome. Well, that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it doesn't show to you folks. Oh shit, there you go. There's the record.

Ranger!

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm gonna move back a little bit. I'm gonna do a thoughtful reload. So I'm gonna do a recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
And she doesn't crit success.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. I know what I recall. Are they particularly weak to any kind of elemental damage?

[Speaker 1]
Cold iron, I assume, doesn't count. No. It's area damage, so they're not particularly weak or immune to any kind of elemental damage.

[Speaker 4]
So do you say they're fey? What?

[Speaker 6]
Are they fey?

[Speaker 1]
They are fey. Like cold iron? Yeah, no, no, cold iron.

This is the, actually, not the first, this is the third gremlin garrison.

[Speaker 4]
That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Teague, you are immobilized.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I am. I'm covered in glue, hopefully it wasn't made from a horse.

[Speaker 1]
I think it was almost certainly made from a horse.

[Speaker 5]
My cousin. Ha!

[Speaker 4]
Free shoot!

[Speaker 1]
What would you like to do? It's your turn.

[Speaker 5]
Okie dokie, I will raise the shield and ready an action to... Can you do combat maneuvers on these types of groups or not? Like trip, disarm, shove, anything like that?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can't. It's any kind of non-damaging effect is subject to approval. And most likely a no.

[Speaker 5]
Ok, I just raise shield, ready an action to attack one if it gets nearby.

[Speaker 1]
If you could target like more people with a given effect, or there's some reason why it would be effective against larger groups of people, then that's where that comes in. I don't know, I don't think this exists. Sure, it's somewhere.

Like a charge action, like alright, well you're sort of cavalry. That might actually fit in somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
There's actually a feat for that.

[Speaker 1]
I believe it. The cultist troop is... Yeah, you guys are kind of like well positioned, mostly.

[Speaker 10]
No!

[Speaker 1]
Let's fire it. That's right, because you're the one, you're still charging up. Yeah, they target me.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly what Dr. Pasha did as well, but wrecked them a second ago.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't think that they have to identify this one.

[Speaker 2]
These damn wizards will do the same thing. Finally they were standing next to explosive barrels. What have you done?

[Speaker 3]
What is it? Is that drug grenade?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's not funny you should ask.

[Speaker 8]
It is!

[Speaker 1]
It is a drug grenade.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not stupefied, I have to do a flatshark on casting a spell. Interesting. Do I have anything that can save me from this?

I don't think so. Oh, that's 18 piercing damage. Yeah, I'm fucked.

Are you dead? I'm not dead, I'm down. Oh no.

Do I knock you unconscious?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm level 1. Nice. No, I was saying that excitedly, not in surprise.

[Speaker 7]
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

[Speaker 2]
What was it, piercing damage? Was it? Yes.

[Speaker 7]
Oh hi!

[Speaker 2]
My initiative would move to above theirs.

[Speaker 1]
I will do that in a better moment. They're in Dr. Bosh's turn. It would be really funny if you could pour potions on people to have it take effect.

Potion of Emergency Escape. Just pour that on an unconscious person. I'm going to use Wild Swing, which I need you for.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hilariously, I shouldn't do that.

[Speaker 1]
Say again?

[Speaker 3]
I said, funny they should do that because one of the effects of the two actions is electric damage when you get hit.

[Speaker 9]
Uh oh.

[Speaker 3]
So it's just the one.

[Speaker 2]
How do I roll the highest save unconscious?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. It's very impressive.

[Speaker 1]
I agree. I'm going to roll damage. Oh, none of you succeeded though.

No. No! Fuck.

It's bad.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
I've taken more damage to myself. I haven't even rolled myself damage yet. I will have taken more damage to myself.

Not by much, but by one.

[Speaker 3]
Do you also take damage for that attack?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they deal damage to themselves because they're swinging wildly.

[Speaker 3]
I see. They also take that one electric damage from hitting me.

[Speaker 1]
I haven't applied it.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
That is their turn.

[Speaker 3]
Cool, awesome. Well, they're fey. No, I won't miss.

Needle darts!

[Speaker 1]
They're almost down to two squares.

[Speaker 3]
Cold iron needle darts.

[Speaker 1]
They are down to two squares. Cool. This one is...

I'd say that square is the one that breaks more out. It's mostly dead.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh, I still have a turn. That is good.

We'll just hit them. Walking stick. Alright.

Attack. He's wounded. I am surprised.

Damage.

[Speaker 1]
Mails.

[Speaker 3]
And then that will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh shit, they're not looking good. They're about to break.

[Speaker 9]
Ranger! Come here, buddy.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to step back, reload, and try to shoot. And miss horribly.

[Speaker 2]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, so they're right next to me. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Let's kick them. Nice, bro. Hell yeah.

Nice. Booked them.

[Speaker 5]
I was trying to do this.

[Speaker 2]
Stomping my feet.

[Speaker 5]
Crushed them. That's all he does. Just gets tired and starts stomping his feet.

[Speaker 1]
So these gremlins, which do not even come up to his knees, just get trampled underfoot. Like a horse getting ready to snackle. I don't know, baby chicks.

[Speaker 8]
Awesome.

[Speaker 5]
It's like Tig had an epiphany. He's like, hmm, single weapon attack or four hoof drive? Eh, four hoofs.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, let me go heal Isha.

[Speaker 2]
I think you get to have a turn before I roll a dying check, so I'm going to do one more.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, you're fine.

[Speaker 2]
It's that easy. I stabilize. With gusto.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, let me heal you up.

[Speaker 1]
These guys do have loot.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, awesome. I'll heal Isha before I take it. Loot is great!

Well done. I'm going to just use all four, because I might as well. Alright, please take all of those.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's all of them. You've put her back to full health. She is very grateful.

[Speaker 5]
So does leveling work like an MMO? I get a golden ore and all my hit points come back?

[Speaker 3]
The rest of you seem fine.

[Speaker 1]
Elixir of Life, select an item variety. What the fuck is that?

[Speaker 5]
It has flavors.

[Speaker 4]
Why did that come up on screen? There is a 2500 gold grenade in there. I'm just going to yank that before James removes it.

[Speaker 1]
Why is there something on here that says Elixir of Life? Did anybody press that?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's because it needs to apply the effect to me for drinking it. It doesn't let the players apply that. What's Elixir of Life?

[Speaker 1]
Miner. Were there multiples used?

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't stack. You can just clear the rest.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so you're healed up to full. Well, we're taking the stuff off them, so let's go do that. Straight into the party shit.

There, there. I'll tell Isa I shan't mention her going down before she can do an attack.

[Speaker 2]
Good.

[Speaker 1]
I had to do it. The plan was to stupefy you.

[Speaker 2]
Hang on, am I still stupefied? The icing on the cake. End of its turn.

No. After I stabilised, I lost that.

[Speaker 3]
That's for the best. Fellas, I am putting it in the party sheet, but do feel free to state what you would like to grab.

[Speaker 1]
Give me a sec. I get it.

[Speaker 4]
Since the grenade's a gunpowder bomb, can I have it? Pretty sure I get to learn it.

[Speaker 5]
Learning. Sounds like work.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so... Self-immolating note. Oh, that's fun.

Who wants to read it before it explodes?

[Speaker 5]
Who here can read?

[Speaker 3]
Who can read? Well, I suppose the two wizards of the group can.

[Speaker 5]
Nah, they learn all spells through picture books.

[Speaker 3]
Ha. Bombs, bombs, bombs. Ooh, I can use bombs.

Interesting. What's a star grenade? Oh my.

[Speaker 2]
It's fucked, but I really want to sell it, but we also then need to find somewhere to sell it. It's, like, item level 17. And we need to find someone willing to pay...

Like, over a thousand gold for it. I would get, like, half for it, unless they really want it.

[Speaker 3]
It is not uncommon, so...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I guess so. That's, like, the entire GDP of Westmarch.

[Speaker 3]
Ha! It can get you one good item.

[Speaker 5]
It's a straight-up trade for, like, a group wagon deck that in bling.

[Speaker 3]
Hey man, you can get yourself a flying chariot and a horse.

[Speaker 2]
None of this stuff is good for Esha, as she does not have decks for bombs, and... She does not have decks for guns, and... She does not have the inventor...

Dedication for gadgets, and... I assume a bomb launcher is a gun.

[Speaker 6]
Nah, that's for an alchemist.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sick.

[Speaker 6]
No, bomb launcher is just an item. Do we have an alchemist? It's just an item.

[Speaker 3]
I do! I am part alchemist. On basis of, um...

Archetype.

[Speaker 2]
It is just a bomb gun. It makes the range further. Very cool.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You can do things like alchemist fire and stuff, too.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, neat.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, this all sucks to me. I would love money.

[Speaker 3]
We can sell the star grenade.

[Speaker 2]
How? I really want the money, but we need to find a buyer. That sounds hard.

Or maybe Esha just leaves. Goes and finds a buyer. Good session.

[Speaker 1]
We can actually go back to town. That's not... I don't have an opposition to that.

How loud was the fire? It was loud. You don't see any sign of the patrols from earlier.

[Speaker 2]
Well, they're not coming for us, so that's a good sign.

[Speaker 3]
Mhm. Um... What's being nabbed?

[Speaker 4]
I grabbed a... oh, I didn't show. I grabbed the necrotic bomb.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Hello, bomb.

[Speaker 5]
Is that a memoir map of instructions to get a tattoo, or did you just rip the tattoo off a gremlin?

[Speaker 3]
That's so funny. It's like, yoink! Well, someone who has a shield could use the albative shield plating.

[Speaker 5]
The ablative plating.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to read the self-immolating note if no one else would like to.

[Speaker 3]
You may.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to read the fire note, James. Oh, it's a very simple one. Oh, is that sorry?

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, did Discord just stop? Nope. Or is Discord really quiet?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. What did you say about the note, sorry, James?

[Speaker 1]
It's very simple. Stuff your face. Hope you enjoy the candy.

From signed Candyman.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, my notes fell. I will release the note before it catches the light.

[Speaker 5]
The note might be candy. Try eating it?

[Speaker 3]
It is fire. My dear, it is very much fire.

[Speaker 5]
It's just spicy candy.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys want to go back to town and sell off the grenade to come back, that would be possible, reasonable.

[Speaker 2]
That's what my vote's for, but I'm happy if the others want to keep going. I'll just die.

[Speaker 3]
If we can pop back, you can grab a couple potions on the way back, so. Same with the rest.

[Speaker 4]
I think we should keep it in a time fiend just while we figure out what this Candyman is. Just in case we do need it.

[Speaker 3]
We can sell at the end, so.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. If we find we don't need it, we'll grab it.

[Speaker 3]
There are the other enemies we can also deal with right now, so.

[Speaker 2]
Can we spend 10 minutes then? I would like to treat my wound. That's pretty scary.

I'll just keep going.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so we can deal with the other people across the road. Or, like, down.

[Speaker 4]
I like the duct tape. Are you going to use a pump launcher?

[Speaker 3]
I am so going to try the new stuff we got, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So, off we go to...

[Speaker 1]
Research points earlier, just to give you guys a heads up. The research that you did, you have a partial understanding of the ritual that sends houses down. To reverse it, you understand that there is a catchphrase and an offering required.

The offering can be any gold amount over five gold pieces. Any item worth over five gold pieces. More specifically, not just five gold.

And there is a catchphrase. We were not aware of what the phrase is.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. We can jump one of the vampires to ask them for it. Presuming they live.

Alright, off we go, fans.

[Speaker 2]
I like that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so to the right there are creatures we can beat up. So.

[Speaker 2]
I also like that.

[Speaker 3]
Mhm.

[Speaker 2]
Are we sneaking over there? Went swimmingly last time.

[Speaker 3]
Nah, I'm good, I'll just hit the search.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think we need to sneak after the noise we just made.

[Speaker 11]
Mhm.

[Speaker 1]
Vampires themselves.

[Speaker 2]
Fuckers.

[Speaker 10]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
They don't call me the eagle eyed ranger for nothing. And I give them little finger guns.

[Speaker 3]
Is it stink or search? That's the one that gives you the minor bonus.

[Speaker 10]
Scout.

[Speaker 3]
Scout! I keep, I keep... Give me a second.

[Speaker 2]
Oh good.

[Speaker 3]
Scout. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I'm a big fan of seeing their initiative stealth.

[Speaker 1]
Well the good news is that only two of them were stealth. The other two I fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
There's no way in hell I'm beating that so they're gone. Luckily only two of them stayed. That should be really easy to fight.

How close can we get before we have to roll initiative?

[Speaker 9]
Good question.

[Speaker 1]
You'd be 65 feet away.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Take out yourself two initiative please.

[Speaker 8]
I am...

[Speaker 1]
He's just gonna continue... Hiding. Nothing else for him to...

To do without... This one on the other hand is just gonna straight dive for it.

[Speaker 9]
Dr. Bastion.

[Speaker 3]
That is my turn. Oh, they are right next to me. That's fun.

I had like a sheet open so I hadn't seen that part of the screen. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's how it works. You're probably doing the same thing as your character.

[Speaker 10]
Heavy delay Dr. Bastion.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Bastion. Oh, did they...

[Speaker 7]
Hello, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, did you just... Give me a second. Oh, I was on stream.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. So give me one moment to come back as the... As I reconnect.

I am going to try and grab these guys but unfortunately first I have to... Be able to see the screen.

[Speaker 5]
Do it by feel.

[Speaker 3]
Do it by feel. Alright. Alright.

I can't... No, sorry. Let me rephrase.

I cannot interact with the game right now so I have to just join game session. I do apologize for that. I shouldn't have disconnected my computer.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to delay your turn?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just delay me for a moment as this loads in.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Okie dokie. Ah, it says I can't move.

[Speaker 2]
You're still immobilized.

[Speaker 9]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Oh man, that's a shield.

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean you can't move?

[Speaker 5]
It says movement is set to combat turn currently not your turn.

[Speaker 10]
Ah, we're back.

[Speaker 5]
There it goes. Gotta help out our doctor. Move up.

Do a snagging strike. And I'll kick this one. Maybe not.

Swing and a miss. I'll raise my shield.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Hold on.

[Speaker 11]
Doctor Basha.

[Speaker 3]
Hello. Hello. I can see the screen again.

Do I stay?

[Speaker 11]
I have vanished.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I vanished. I was like, what happened? Okay.

Give me a good moment. We are going to set these people on fire. Because why not?

[Speaker 5]
Fire is cleansing.

[Speaker 3]
Mhm. So I'm just going to set it right on top of them. Where is 5 foot square?

Right there. Oops, give me a second. It should not be on you.

Give me a moment to move it. There we go. It's these guys.

[Speaker 7]
Roll damage.

[Speaker 3]
Please do basic reflex.

[Speaker 1]
Remember to target people.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god. Yes, you're right. Sorry.

50-50. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Shoot, the second one almost jumped directly into the ball.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. One more. I just shield.

And that's my turn.

[Speaker 9]
Ranger.

[Speaker 8]
Heats.

[Speaker 4]
You're muted if you're speaking. Oops. I think I'm going to go kabow!

And I shoot the ball at him. And it should do one persistent acid damage.

[Speaker 1]
You got to send that, but anything else on your turn?

[Speaker 4]
That is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and add that persistent damage to the chat if you get a chance. Airstrike. Sound of combat.

[Speaker 2]
Do I need to be around this building to target the guys?

[Speaker 8]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
I think the centaur moved through it. I'm going to stride over to here then, where I can see them. Hold up.

That guy's not stealthing, is he? There is one hidden vampire.

[Speaker 1]
In quotes, badly. He did roll stealth, as you can see. He got lower than everybody else on the map.

[Speaker 2]
I'll stride to here, sorry. So that's like 20 feet, and I'll target him and the Nosferatu next to Dr. Basha. I'll target them both, actually, rather than just telling you this.

And I'll cast the Spellheart's Hook. They'll both need to make a save, which is there in chat. Cool!

My turn's done.

[Speaker 1]
Nah, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Also, I'm not sure if you can position Flaming Sphere in the middle of Force Quests.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. I'll just... How do I...

That's what the little thing did, but I can adjust it so it doesn't do that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's the wrong button. You might be able to, I'm not sure though.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't have a burst. Burst spells come from a point, but it just says area 5 foot square, which I would assume is a single square.

[Speaker 3]
Alright then, I'll adjust it.

[Speaker 10]
He's gonna eat me.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, what if we hit it again, and then... And then... A single action to grab.

Okay. Adjust the damage then.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Teg, if you do stomp them again, make sure it's non-lethal damage so we can wrangle information out of them.

[Speaker 1]
Teg, are you there? Yep. Alright, so...

I don't know how much harness your shield has or whatever, so...

[Speaker 5]
Uh, 5.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you're gonna have to take the damage that's left over, and just...

[Speaker 2]
If you click the plus next to the damage, you can select the block button, and then take the damage from there, which will automatically calculate that.

[Speaker 1]
Can I do that, or does he have to do that?

[Speaker 2]
You should be able to, if you have Teg's token selected.

[Speaker 1]
If I have it selected... The block... Nothing happens.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. I'll just do it manually. Oh, it only took out the correct amount.

[Speaker 1]
Did it? So you have to press it. If I click block, nothing happens.

[Speaker 2]
Did you click block, then click the damage button? And it deducted it automatically.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Maybe that's it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the block's like a toggle, James.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Alright. Very good.

[Speaker 2]
It's really handy. It's one of my favorite things.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to walk around the building.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it also took the hit points away from the shield automatically. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
I do want to grapple the target. Yes! Oh, nice.

That is...

[Speaker 3]
That is so rude.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't it?

[Speaker 3]
You want to know what's really funny? Give me a sec. Ah, I failed.

Never mind.

[Speaker 1]
It was pretty funny. I don't know how you played that in advance. It was a great punchline.

Oh, you're restrained.

[Speaker 9]
It's automatic.

[Speaker 3]
This is just regular damage, right? He's just punching me? Yep.

[Speaker 11]
Ow.

[Speaker 9]
Don't touch me.

[Speaker 1]
You are... Yeah, there you go. So you get drained one, I get a little bit of hit points back, everybody's happy.

Tig!

[Speaker 5]
Step up here.

[Speaker 1]
That was a step, not a...

[Speaker 5]
Let's see if I can hit this one in front of me. He's flanked.

[Speaker 1]
Damage.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, I meant to do a snagging strike. Dang it, I forgot. Oh well.

[Speaker 1]
You can grab him as well if you want to.

[Speaker 5]
Well, it doesn't really grab him, it just gives him the off-guard condition while he stays next to me.

[Speaker 1]
I'll play it off-guard.

[Speaker 5]
But since he's already flanked, it doesn't matter. You can't, they don't stack.

[Speaker 2]
It would for people that aren't next to him though, like Ranga.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, throw that in there, he doesn't...

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, what's the rest of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Raise shield! He's done.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Dr. Basha, you are grappled and restrained.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, incredibly rude. That's why I made sure to invest in things that stopped me from getting grabbed. Please...

Oops, I'm targeting too many creatures. Give me a sec. Please do a basic reflex save.

Boop. Oh, cool. Awesome.

I'm going to move you 10 feet. If you don't mind. Oh, not away.

I'm moving you up here.

[Speaker 1]
No you're not, that's a building.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it is a building. Well, away it is. Goodbye!

Sorry about that, lad. Can't I move you through, people?

[Speaker 8]
To like...

[Speaker 3]
No, I suppose I can't. Up here then, so he's not right next to Ranga.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, sure, sure.

[Speaker 4]
Move it vertically. I just want to say, there is an ER in there.

[Speaker 3]
Ranger. There. Alright.

You took the damage. Awesome, cool. And then I will use the remaining turn to move the fire down here.

[Speaker 1]
Where's Boy Mac? Is Boy Mac in gay baby jail? Has he been misbehaving?

[Speaker 3]
Let me roll the damage. Roll damage. I'm targeting the wrong person.

Control T. Control T. Control T.

Alright, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Equip next. That's fine.

[Speaker 3]
So, that is... I just move it on and off the guy. Please do the basic reflex save and then that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Huh? Cool. F.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to do a little thoughtful reload and I'll try to recall knowledge. Is this also a failure on undead? Or both?

[Speaker 1]
It is an undead.

[Speaker 4]
Can I check if it has any resistances?

[Speaker 1]
All physical damage except for silver.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, elemental resistances?

[Speaker 1]
All physical except for silver.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Perfect. And I'll reload an acid and then I'll do a shot.

Ayyyyy!

[Speaker 10]
Nice!

[Speaker 1]
What did you get?

[Speaker 10]
Good then.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, weird. Oh, I shouldn't have told you that. I should have said, actually, they're great.

You can only use physical stuff against them. That's fine though. You're good.

You're damaged. You could have gotten up at any time. You're just making me upset.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's what fatal aim is. That's cool.

[Speaker 4]
No, fatal aim is if you use two hands. Yeah, it gains the fatal trait. Fatal aim should be when you use two hands, it does a 1d12 damage.

Yeah?

[Speaker 1]
What are you guys talking about?

[Speaker 2]
I just hadn't seen the fatal aim trait before.

[Speaker 4]
No, it's not doing the fatal aim right.

[Speaker 2]
What? Yeah, it is. Because you're using it two hands you get the d12 damage for fatal.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I've got to check that weapon, it's not working right. Okay, that went, and then I'm going to do a reload for another 5 shots.

It's still dead. Yep, so instead I'm reloading another elemental ammo, and that'll be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. Airship!

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to drain my staff, sorry, my spear, so I can get back to Thundersphere. Then I'm going to cast Thundersphere with three actions on the guy next to Dr. Basha. Which is this.

I still have a hero point, well off, and attack roll. That's out of 17, it doesn't get much better than that. The damage is 11.

Electricity damage.

[Speaker 1]
You're not looking happy.

[Speaker 2]
All three of my actions.

[Speaker 9]
Very good, very good.

[Speaker 1]
Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.

[Speaker 5]
Did it just move out of my threatened square? Yes it did.

[Speaker 6]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 1]
If you're going to attack him, you better not take 10 fucking minutes. Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
I'll dismiss.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thank god, I thought that was the damage. You're scaring me.

[Speaker 8]
What is he doing?

[Speaker 1]
That should be here. Give me a sec. That should have only been four damage.

I'm going to reverse your other damage and apply that. Thank you. Sneak attack should not have been on.

[Speaker 10]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
That is his turn. This one is, you know what? He's living today.

He chooses life. He chooses unlike. This guy is in something of a panic, so we're going to start off with the miss.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, good.

[Speaker 1]
And the miss. And the miss. Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
He got closer this time. A little bit. Tig!

[Speaker 5]
All right. Let's see if we can do something horrible to this guy. Now he's snagged.

I don't think it matters much.

[Speaker 1]
All right, anything else for your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Try a second time.

[Speaker 1]
Hits.

[Speaker 5]
Let's actually raise a shield. He's down.

[Speaker 1]
Normally it's just like on the brink, or maybe only does that for your character. Staff the basher!

[Speaker 3]
Oh, awesome. We're sustaining that fire and we're dragging it down onto this guy. Let me trigger the thing again.

Floating flame. Damage. Oh, no, there's another guy that's unconscious.

Don't worry. That guy is fully dead though. And then with that wonderful thing done we have two other actions.

We can deal with the one that is currently bothering Esha. Do I have anything that can help you right now? Nope.

Needle darts it is. Splendid!

[Speaker 9]
Very good.

[Speaker 3]
And bleed damage if they're not immune to that. Oh, good question.

[Speaker 1]
They are not.

[Speaker 5]
Well, they have blood in them whether it's theirs or someone else's.

[Speaker 1]
I guess they are. Oh, well, because bleeding is physical. If that makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
So they take the three persistent bleed damage and then that is his turn.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, so I'm This fella, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Just trying to find distances. Distances. You can probably stand on that one that's unconscious next to Tig.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, stand on the one next to Tig or you can Hold on, did you move through the building?

[Speaker 4]
Nah, I ran along the escorts.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Nah, shoot him and I go kapow! Perfect. And then I reload my gun with another shot.

[Speaker 2]
I will try and escape.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't doubled in chat? I have to do that when I apply it. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That is something that catches me up. Spells don't get doubled. When you crit, you have to click double damage unless I've missed something but 5d4 I think is the base damage right, Dr. Basha?

It has to be. You can't double something into 5d4. Escape.

Where is that?

[Speaker 1]
Between the gunfire and the needle darts.

[Speaker 2]
Luigi wins by doing nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Tig still has enough to level up.

[Speaker 2]
Please tell me I get double XP. Or did we all get double XP? What do I level up now?

Wait till we get back to town.

[Speaker 1]
I left in the vampire who did not participate. So you did not get double, but you did get more. There's a third patrol down at the bottom if you're looking to farm.

[Speaker 4]
I think we're just some kind of murder herbos because we are. Yeah, what? What?

[Speaker 1]
I think they hear me.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, where's the third one?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not going to criticize anything. Third patrol down in the forest. A bunch of the dog critters being ridden by gremlins.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to load up some bane ammunition. Let's get us some hunting done.

[Speaker 1]
At this point the patrol is probably going to go off and try to try to go off and get another troop of gremlins. But what are you guys doing? You have a bunch of unconscious you have two to be specific, you have two unconscious rather shitty ugly looking vampire spawn.

[Speaker 4]
Let's wrap them up in garlic. Make them eat some garlic bread.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, didn't Ranger boil this one's head off? Which one's the unconscious one?

[Speaker 1]
I think the one that died via fire might still be burning, might just be dead.

[Speaker 2]
This one died to needle darts which is not an unlethal spell I don't think.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing was non-lethal, it's just when they drop to 0 HP they don't die.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's a them thing. I see.

[Speaker 1]
Can you tie them up? I mean, yeah you can tie them up.

[Speaker 9]
But does anyone have rope?

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 9]
I have rope.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, let's tie them up and get these secret passwords. Candyman can.

[Speaker 5]
I found Miriam saying Candyman three times.

[Speaker 1]
People are just peeing things. What are you guys doing? I thought we were tying them up.

You are tying them up. And after that?

[Speaker 2]
It actually needs to take ten minutes to refocus while he does this. He's going to move out of the room.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds good.

[Speaker 3]
I have been muted. I was asking, do vampires take healing from void damage or does it have to be void healing specifically?

[Speaker 2]
It's mostly the heal and harm spells that do that. But they shouldn't be able to benefit from vitality, I think.

[Speaker 5]
Because I know if you have something that does vitality, it doesn't auto-heal. It has to actually specify heals.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I was just asking so I could just toss a potion on one of these guys to wake them up now. As much as it's a waste, we do need them awake for this.

[Speaker 2]
It'll need to be a... I think healing elixirs don't have the vitality trait.

[Speaker 3]
Cool, I'll just toss one of those then.

[Speaker 4]
There's also a potion of unlife too.

[Speaker 3]
I don't have one of those and if I did I wouldn't waste it on this guy because those are expensive. Alright, I know. I cannot give them the health, but imagine I do and now we're doing a shakedown of this guy.

I do imagine we have the latter person tied up as well so that if or when they wake up they don't scamper off. They do have void healing, fantastic! So I don't have to waste a potion.

I can just toss void warp on them.

[Speaker 4]
Void warp?

[Speaker 3]
Nope, that's not void healing. That just does damage. It does void damage, not void healing.

I'll use the elixir of life, it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Void warp you can only target a living creature.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, that is so rude.

[Speaker 4]
They're still living, they're conscious.

[Speaker 3]
They don't appear to wake up on their own. That's so impolite. Good lord.

Even after healing them with a potion, so rude. How do we wake these guys up? Well, we can kick them.

[Speaker 5]
Kick them in the side. Hmm? Give him a purple nurple.

[Speaker 3]
What is a purple nurple?

[Speaker 5]
Basically, nipple twist. Just grab and pinch and twist.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. While you are doing that, I will go... I'll...

Who needs healing? You guys are fine. You're fine.

[Speaker 5]
I'm only down a third.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you are not fine. Scraped, banged up, banged up. Oy.

Well, don't die in the next five minutes and all should be well.

[Speaker 9]
Is this...

[Speaker 3]
Ah, that's a shame. Is this building abandoned? The one that still has the fireplace light in it?

If so, we can put them in the fireplace and see if the point of revulsion wakes them up by force. If there's no information garnered from them, we will just have to put them down, so to speak. So, nothing happens part two.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Well, Tink can try something. Not sure if he has some medical training. Yay, sports injuries.

He will use his dagger, cut himself and drip blood all over the vampire's face and mouth.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, thousand is left at this point for the missing church. Cool, awesome. We'll go look for them.

Uh, Tink said he dropped blood on the vampire's face.

[Speaker 5]
Take a point of damage for that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so, Tink, it works. Uh, James said that you need to take a drained one though, but it will work.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, drained.

[Speaker 3]
In order to wake this guy up, alas. It's fine, you will be fine after one long night's rest.

[Speaker 5]
Okey-dokey.

[Speaker 8]
Sounds fair.

[Speaker 5]
There you go, drained.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, James said he'll be back in a sec, so we can chillax. I'll refocus while doing so.

[Speaker 5]
You might have a healing kit?

[Speaker 3]
I do have a healing kit. I do have some potions. One sec.

[Speaker 5]
Are you proficient with the healing kit? Take just a basic and it's not very excellent.

[Speaker 2]
I have plus three to medicine, so not really. Yeah, I'll borrow that from you.

[Speaker 3]
I can give you a potion as well if you need it.

[Speaker 2]
I have to spend ten minutes refocusing anyway, so I'll try to heal myself. Sure, you can borrow my healing kit.

[Speaker 4]
If you want.

[Speaker 11]
If you want.

[Speaker 4]
If you want, I can practice my hands. I got pretty steady hands.

[Speaker 11]
Uh-huh.

[Speaker 3]
He's the best at medicine here. It's Tig. Stranger, you will kill him.

[Speaker 4]
With that attitude, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
You are entertaining.

[Speaker 5]
Let's have the kit in my inventory.

[Speaker 3]
You can get handed the kit.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'll drag it to you. I didn't realize it would not let you do it until I...

[Speaker 10]
There you are.

[Speaker 2]
There you go. Better than nothing. If you just drag the kit back to my token, now it'll give it back.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
So this one will come back to... I just have to add train one, which you might already have. Yes.

Yeah, the fellow is stuck.

[Speaker 4]
We should tie something to his hand. Tie a grenade in his hand, so if he does anything bad he tries to run, he'll die. We should hand him a grenade and...

No, no. Tie a hand grenade to him.

[Speaker 2]
Can I do a recall knowledge on this guy?

[Speaker 4]
Of course.

[Speaker 2]
I'll do the check and then ask my question. That should be like religion or something, which I'm trained in.

[Speaker 1]
What is your...

[Speaker 2]
Does this guy have fast healing? He does. Oh, that's incredible.

Alright, my ten minutes is done. I'm leaving.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We can't stab him every so often, you know. He does not appear to be fast healing right now.

[Speaker 2]
That is more interesting. I'm coming back.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Questioning time. Alright, I'll start off.

Would you be so kind to inform us of the... You know what? I'll be direct.

Would you be so kind to inform us of the passphrase to get to the church?

[Speaker 1]
Why should I do that?

[Speaker 3]
Well, you'll die if you don't.

[Speaker 1]
You'll kill me anyways.

[Speaker 3]
I'm already dead. You don't know that. We could promise we won't.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the Fae make better promises, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm Fae. And that's not a lie.

[Speaker 1]
Don't smell the...

[Speaker 3]
So I'll keep my promise. Yes, now I am. Fae influence, baby.

Ah. So, he is getting back part of his lost Fae stuff, so that's great. Very cool.

So, you tell us what we need to know, and we let you go this time.

[Speaker 1]
No, you swear to let me go, and then I'll tell you what I know.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'll let you go.

[Speaker 1]
I promise. Okay, that's... I think that's how it works, anyway.

The passphrase is stuff your face.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Like on the note. Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Well, my end of the deal is done. Is there anything we must know before going into the church?

[Speaker 1]
You must know. Uh... That's a good question.

There are guardians inside the door. Stone guardians, they'll... They don't take kindly if you enter without introducing yourself.

[Speaker 3]
And how should we introduce myself not to be attacked?

[Speaker 1]
You just have to introduce yourself. There's a visitor's log at the front of the church.

[Speaker 3]
Wondered.

[Speaker 1]
There's an altar in the far back. There's some pews. You know.

Some pews in the centre. And, uh... There's rooms that go off on the sides.

We've been stacking kids up in... The... Stacking kids up in the Sunday school room that's on the left side.

At the end of the... Where the altar is, it goes down into a hollow.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Who is guarding the children?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what else to call it. I'm like, hey, it's gonna be Sunday school.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
So what was your last question?

[Speaker 3]
Ah, right. Who's guarding the Sunday school?

[Speaker 1]
Usually other vampires. There's other fey there too.

[Speaker 3]
I'll ask if any of the others have questions for the guy.

[Speaker 2]
That's just ready to kill this guy.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, only one person probably let him down.

[Speaker 1]
The kids are still alive, they're just being used in a ritual. Hmm. It's not gonna harm them.

What's the ritual for? Oh, that we weren't told.

[Speaker 11]
Honest.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Now, my final question, personally, is where will you go once we let you free? Oops, sorry. Once I let you free.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna find a coffin and chill out. If you mean like afterwards, I'm actually not sure. Go north.

Um... I think I'd like Orton for a change. Be nice.

[Speaker 11]
Orton.

[Speaker 1]
I know there's another crypt somewhere around here. I'm kinda tempted to go there and try my luck.

[Speaker 11]
But...

[Speaker 1]
Nah, I wanna strike out solo. I don't know if I wanna join up with another vampire to see it.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. And uh, true to their words, they'll let them go. And walk off.

What others do is none of their business. But they did their point. Actually, you know what?

Last question. Do we have to say the passphrase at the church area?

[Speaker 11]
Uh, I guess.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. Thanks. That's about it then.

I presume we know where that is.

[Speaker 4]
We were on the top of the hill, wasn't it?

[Speaker 3]
Mhm. So, uh... The doctor isn't going to stick around to see what the others do, but they keep their promise and dip off.

Because they did say they'll let them go.

[Speaker 2]
He's spreading off. Would I be able to cast one ray of frost at him before he gets away? Sure thing.

[Speaker 11]
What's this guy's spell?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you cut out.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry. What is this vampire's spell thing?

[Speaker 1]
No, the person's casting the spell.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, magic. His AC might be fucked because he's dead. You might just need to add...

Roll anyway. I mean, sorry. Does he keep running?

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah. We're gonna shoot him. I don't know who to attack because everyone's dead.

[Speaker 3]
I promised not to get him. Sure, sure. I made sure my wording was correct so that when they inevitably attacked him as he was running, I would not get messed over for that.

[Speaker 4]
Where's he running from? Us.

[Speaker 1]
No, but like, which direction? Why the fuck does that matter? He has one hit point.

If you were going to shoot him, you roll an attack. Yeah, so I could target him, though. They're all sick.

You feel an increasing sense of dread.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it doesn't matter. Alright. I'll just be like, hey, guys.

Don't. Leave him be.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think you can make him run any faster by teasing him with attacks.

[Speaker 4]
That was a warning shot. If we see you again... Fuck you!

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's it. I want to do another shot. You're not my type.

He's outta here.

[Speaker 1]
He's running 75 feet. He's definitely behind buildings. Well, that's it.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, wait. I can run 90 feet. Do you run 90 feet and also shoot?

I can run 60 feet and shoot.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, actually, I can't. I can run 80 feet and shoot. Okay.

Are you going to do it, though? Do we want to chase him down with a potion of emergency escape? No, it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
He's not going to come back. He very explicitly said he's just going to leave into the mountains and whatnot after Orton, so you do not have to chase him down.

[Speaker 4]
That doesn't let me chip Sinatraa. It makes me flee. I'm good.

Let's go.

[Speaker 2]
Are we able to spend 10 more minutes? I'd like to try and treat my wounds. No one has said no.

I'll do it. Easy. If I fail, it's going to be because I roll a 1 or something and kill myself, so it'll be fine.

No, it actually would have saved me. My hero points come for me. Incredible.

Alright. Am I allowed to swap out characters?

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to go back to...

[Speaker 2]
I only have cantrips left.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, do you want to go back to town at this point?

[Speaker 2]
Everyone has to... I can't. No.

I'll just keep going then.

[Speaker 3]
If I gave you enough bombs, would that work?

[Speaker 1]
I'm okay saying this because you and I have been playing for a while. At this point, I would be insisting that I go back to town.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I really like Esha. She wants to go back to town.

[Speaker 3]
You're not letting her die? Fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
No, not just to rest for a day and come back. Sell off a bunch of loot.

[Speaker 3]
That's true, so we can be more well-prepared.

[Speaker 2]
We know how to get into the church now.

[Speaker 3]
So, if we rest for the day, we should be a-okay.

[Speaker 1]
If I had to risk 3,000 gold pieces in this game to run for it, I would kill you guys in real life.

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough. Honestly, I was getting blinded by the 120 XP I need to get to level 2.

[Speaker 1]
How far are you going to get more than 120?

[Speaker 2]
I still think those vampires should have been double XP. Oh, you can give me the sweet vampire dedication as level 2, James. That'd be cool.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good idea.

[Speaker 3]
Is it worth it? Being a vampire? I feel like you lose a lot out of it.

The sun, being alive. Fair enough. Isha would make a good vampire.

[Speaker 2]
I can't be a sparkling vampire until you get Daywalker at like 10th level.

[Speaker 7]
Perhaps then hold off for a bit.

[Speaker 2]
I know it's going home. I want money. Send all of the money with me and I'll sell it.

[Speaker 3]
By the way, if you do become an undead, Dr. Basha will study you like a bug. I hope you're aware of that. They'll be like, ooh!

[Speaker 2]
Dr. Basha should become good friends with Maya then. She will be taking the vampire dedication.

[Speaker 3]
Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
And she's already a dampier.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Sisudio actually genuinely offered himself as an experiment when I was just like, ooh, can I study you? He was like, yeah, sure.

So, a win for dampiers, at least.

[Speaker 2]
How hard is it to get back to town? Take the boat back?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you just take the boat back.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet.

[Speaker 1]
So what are we doing shopping?

[Speaker 2]
How can we sell our expensive bomb?

[Speaker 1]
You can sell it, I think, to the... What's her face? High Priestess Abigail will purchase it for half price as a favor to be available for resurrection.

Because her schedule is about to close up. With a holy hand grenade!

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so if we sell her the thing, we have one cash-in of reviving people?

[Speaker 1]
You will still have to pay the 75 gold.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
What she's gonna do is she's gonna take out a... I'm not gonna explain the full thing of it. She will be able to pay you half price for that thing where not necessarily everybody in the city would be able to.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, fair enough.

[Speaker 2]
Any objections to doing that?

[Speaker 3]
Zero objections. I like money.

[Speaker 5]
I like living, too. Kind of a toss-up.

[Speaker 3]
Ranger, get on the boat!

[Speaker 2]
Yep. We seem like three kilometers away chasing a vampire. Dr. Masher just feeling an overwhelming sense of dread.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys can't believe Dr. Masher's gonna take like a three... Well, at first it was just gonna be Dr. Basher. Then I was like, eh.

Everybody was gonna take like a frighten three.

[Speaker 11]
Fuck you.

[Speaker 4]
The item is in the guild's dash. Do we get like 1250 gold from it?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
What's that divided by four?

[Speaker 3]
That is 304 gold and five silver. 312 G... 5...

[Speaker 4]
Ordines could just like share gold between everyone.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that is the gold amount divided between four people.

[Speaker 7]
Which is us. We are four people.

[Speaker 3]
Unless you are not a person, in which case four creatures of indeterminate... Right.

[Speaker 2]
Well, orangos don't have souls, so...

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and purchase or let me know what you guys would like to purchase if anybody is seeking kind of magical equipment.

[Speaker 2]
I'm looking for that list I sent you. I'm gonna buy some holy water.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going into my shopping list.

[Speaker 2]
I think it was in the Chillmist Valley channel.

[Speaker 3]
Do I have the things I want on my list? Not yet. Still have to save up a bit.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe it's in Town Hall. If I search Aeon Stone it should just come up.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I could grab the next UNC glass.

[Speaker 2]
Magic Wand. Magic Wand sounds really good right now. And I can cast multiple spells.

60 gold each. What else did I want? Spacious Pouch.

Tattoos too hard. Is there anyone in town that can make magic tattoos? Like a specific type of magical crafting.

[Speaker 1]
Not in... Not in Broadlock, I don't think. I do think that it would be available at the Glass Mage's College.

[Speaker 2]
That makes lots of sense.

[Speaker 3]
Would I be able to find someone who has Greater Grim Sandglass? Let me grab it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh?

[Speaker 3]
Let me see if I can pin it. Grim Sandglass. Greater...

Grim Sand.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'll tell you what. Broadlock is 7 and Broadlock definitely has some of the buildings that increase item level through purchase.

[Speaker 3]
I can improve upon that. Thank you!

[Speaker 5]
I picked up basic stuff that I couldn't get when I made the character. Like kits. Healing kit.

Repair kit. Basic stuff.

[Speaker 11]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I can repair my shield.

[Speaker 3]
How would one go about upgrading Broadlock itself?

[Speaker 2]
That's a good question.

[Speaker 1]
That is a good question. I feel like a lot of the Kingmaker stuff is actually going to have to start at the beginning of next month. Which is pretty soon, to be fair.

I've been very nervous about getting the macros and stuff like that, but now it works. Now the macros are working pretty great. And add nonsense.

I have tables for stuff. Then I have macros for rolling on those tables and adding the material in. I can throw bullshit in.

I should look up gadgets. I don't think anybody's made an inventor. Is that what they are?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. There's an auto-gym sitting there. He's an inventor.

It relates to innovations. There's the three types. There's a weapon innovation, an armor innovation, and a familiar innovation.

Sorry, companion.

[Speaker 4]
Companion.

[Speaker 1]
Are they only able to be used by inventors?

[Speaker 2]
I have no clue. I have no clue what they do.

[Speaker 4]
I think anyone can use them, it's just that inventors get a bonus to it.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I was thinking. There was one item from earlier that fucks with fey and undead, specifically.

[Speaker 3]
The moment we get into that church, it's being set off. Let me ping it, actually. I made sure to get it.

It's a consumable.

[Speaker 1]
You make your save.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, haha, yes. I do have to make the save now. I'll be fine.

Actually, you know what? I'll hand it off to someone who doesn't need to make the save. Is Isha coming back for the next round?

[Speaker 2]
If we can, like, spend a day healing. I would need to rest, actually. Before I rest, James, my Staff of Air is a 60 gold item.

A Wand of Level 1 Spells is a third level 60 gold item. Would anyone want to swap me, my Staff for a Wand of Mystic Armor?

[Speaker 1]
I think you can make that trade.

[Speaker 2]
Sick. Okay. I would like to buy Staff of the Unblinking Eye.

It is a uncommon item. Fuck. Never mind.

It's an uncommon item of 6th level. It's an uncommon item of 6th level. Where's the...

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
I'd like to spend 230 gold buying it. Well, that's the base price. Does it have any markup?

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Use Diplomacy to get a better price?

[Speaker 2]
Burrow badly, then he's gonna mark it up out of spite. That's what I would do if someone tried to haggle me.

[Speaker 1]
How would you use it? This is gonna be great. There's people who come from haggle cultures, I'll say, who will, at my work from home job, will ask me, like, how about a discount?

How about it? I have only increased the price in response to that twice.

[Speaker 3]
That's very funny.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so along Staff of Air, I can add a Unblinking Eye staff to my... So my staff actually is part of my polearm. It used to be a feat, but they just added it to the base Runelord class, which is really nice.

And a... How do you make a wand? I think you drag a bell into your inventory.

Which was... Mystic. It'll be like I'm level 2.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, I can get heavy armor now. Yay.

[Speaker 4]
Should go buy that. Should I buy a plus one potency rune? And the other thing that goes in it?

Primary.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my goodness. Oh, plus one. What, the property runes?

Those are sold separately, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
Do you mean a striking rune?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Yeah, plus one potency and a striking rune.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with buying those.

[Speaker 4]
Or am I too low to buy it? What's the price? I mean, striking I think is just...

[Speaker 2]
So the level of an item doesn't matter if you're in a settlement that has it. The item level... The settlement level needs to be above that.

So if you have the money to buy it, you can get items above your level.

[Speaker 4]
So I can spend 100 gold to get a plus one potency and a striking?

[Speaker 1]
Is 100 gold each? 100 gold for both?

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Yeah, 165, 135.

[Speaker 2]
Applying them to your weapon takes crafting time. I believe. The etching process.

Etching a rune onto an item follows the same process as using craft activity to make an item. How long are we going to be in town for?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so striking is 65 gold pieces.

[Speaker 4]
Runes count a tenth for adding them on? What?

[Speaker 2]
You'll need to spend... Someone will need to spend a day per rune adding them to your weapon. You can pay a crafter in town.

I've been using the earn income level of the item for that, or maybe it's two days. I need to look at crafting.

[Speaker 5]
Do you have to have magical crafting, or just crafting?

[Speaker 2]
There is someone in Bronloch that has magical crafting that I have paid them to do this process. But I did it during downtime.

[Speaker 5]
Are there any hand wraps of Mighty Blows available?

[Speaker 1]
Sure there are.

[Speaker 5]
It's a level 2 common item, so it can't be too rare. Can I put those hand wraps around my legs like 80s leg warmers? I'll take his full plate, now he's more clankity clank.

His stealth is probably worse than ever now.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, by the way Landy, the doctor gave the irritant to Isha. Is it Isha or Esha?

[Speaker 2]
Esha, I think. I think there's I think there's like an...

[Speaker 4]
So if you transfer it from a room to town, it's free. There's a 10% price if you're swapping them from one to the other. You still need to pay someone to do it, unless you can do it.

I would assume that would be part of the purchasing price. As they'll craft a weapon for you. Or they'll earn it for you.

[Speaker 3]
That's true. I do have magical crafting, so in the future past this...

[Speaker 2]
I did not assume it's part of the purchasing price. Unless you were buying a weapon with the runes already on it.

[Speaker 1]
If you're buying a weapon with the runes already on it, which is subject to availability heuristics, otherwise you do have to spend money to have it etched on or something.

[Speaker 6]
So there's no etching cost? Is it free? You have to spend money to have it etched on or something.

[Speaker 1]
And that amount of money is greater than zero.

[Speaker 2]
What is the level of the potency?

[Speaker 6]
Potency... I think as you mentioned, we've just been using It's only fundamental.

[Speaker 2]
No, what level is the item?

[Speaker 4]
It's... So, weapon potency plus one is two, striking is level four.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so the day for the striking rune costs three silver, the day for the striking rune costs eight silver. Using the crafting earn income rules. So it would cost an extra what did I say?

Eleven silver on top of the hundred gold you're spending or whatever it was. And two days of time as they... Now that sounds silly.

[Speaker 4]
If you're going to buy the rune and they craft it that would be part of the activity because they etch the rune into it and that's the cost to actually do it on the item is the cost price, where you can etch it onto a rune and then you can transfer the rune to an item for free.

[Speaker 3]
Also, if you're By the way, if you're improving upon a rune you minus the cost of the last level.

[Speaker 2]
So you're saying they craft the rune on a runestone and then put it on your gun? Is that what you're saying? So then they're spending twice as long crafting it and doing the job twice.

The rune costs... The rune is worth its value.

[Speaker 1]
I have I have already provided my ruling for this which is... And the weapon can be etched with... So sure, if you were making the rune yourself you can etch it onto a runestone but then you're going to be paying for the...

[Speaker 2]
How I envision this happening is you go to the blacksmith or whoever has magical crafting and you say I would like a potency rune put on my weapon. And the rune costs 35 gold the labor costs what was it 3 silver. So he says yes here's the rune, pay for that now and my labor of the day's work will be 3 silver I put that the day passes he puts that on your weapon and you repeat that for the striking rune.

Does that make sense? Because the the rune doesn't have to be on a runestone, it doesn't have to exist before it's on your weapon.

[Speaker 4]
So if you go to a blacksmith and get them to craft the rune for you the cost price is the list price the 10% is if you're swapping a rune from one weapon to another weapon. So just say I have a plus one long sword and I want it to be a plus one short sword You're not paying the 10% here though.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[Speaker 1]
I don't understand what the argument is.

[Speaker 2]
The labor of paying someone to do this for you. If you were doing this yourself yes.

[Speaker 1]
If you're doing this yourself then it's at cost if you're purchasing it from these people what I've said is I don't know what you said, that's the whole point.

[Speaker 2]
You're paying for someone to craft he needs to do the service as well as you need to pay for the service as well as paying for the item. The service is not part of the item.

[Speaker 4]
That would be like saying if you buy a long sword you need to pay the long sword cost and then crafting cost on top of that.

[Speaker 1]
It's not magical crafting. In existence there's a stock of long swords. I don't know why we're arguing about this.

You just got a massive fucking haul for free or not for free but for at very low cost I am not encouraged by arguing over 3 fucking silver for purchases from a really really large haul.

[Speaker 2]
If you pay for 3 silver he spends a day doing it for you. You just got 300 gold.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know why you're arguing about 3 silver.

[Speaker 4]
No, that's what I'm just trying to figure out because I'm not sure we're using 3 silver for I've made the ruling on it.

[Speaker 1]
I am not inclined to continue arguing about it. How many days is it going to take?

[Speaker 3]
One day.

[Speaker 4]
One day.

[Speaker 3]
So next session it will be available basically.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Now, off topic things. When they're on the boat the doctor will ask if Aisha would mind to show the picture she was doodling while refocusing.

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

[Speaker 3]
Well, okay.

[Speaker 2]
She explains that to refocus her focus spell. She has to indulge her rune.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. He'll just laugh at that and let it go. It won't be like a full laugh but it'll just be like a, oh, ha!

And be like, alright.

[Speaker 2]
She thanks you for understanding. So, Aisha's rune is lost.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, that is so funny.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, fair enough. Oh, and also gave the irritant over to her since it would in fact blow their drums out.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, yes. She says, of course. Let me know when you'd like it back.

Okay, I go shopping. I spend like ten minutes healing myself until it works for the rest of the night I sleep. We go back to this stupid church.

I'm just going to buy healing potions. How many healing potions can I buy?

[Speaker 1]
I think you can buy them all. At least ten.

[Speaker 2]
Not expecting a discount or anything. I just want them. Buying ten is excessive.

I don't have that much money. Well, I do. But I don't want to spend all.

[Speaker 11]
You do!

[Speaker 2]
I'll drink them eventually, though. Yeah, I'll just buy ten. What's that?

Forty? Forty gold? Because I can't drink them if I die.

[Speaker 4]
But how are you going to carry them?

[Speaker 2]
I have the hefty haul of feet.

[Speaker 3]
That's so cool. I love that.

[Speaker 2]
I also got that from my OP background. Thank you, RareTag.

[Speaker 3]
What background did you get?

[Speaker 2]
Planar Migrant.

[Speaker 3]
Ah!

[Speaker 8]
That's fun!

[Speaker 2]
For some reason it gives you both the hefty haul of feet and the prescient planar feet. A level 2 and a level 3 feet.

[Speaker 3]
That's so fun!

[Speaker 2]
So for the plane of bullets? Plane of air. She is a genie kin.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh!

[Speaker 1]
Which is why she doesn't make the second session. I need to sleep.

[Speaker 3]
Goodnight!

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to have about six hours to do so. Give or take. She's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for not killing us.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for not killing us. Thank you for not dying. You guys were really well positioned for me to use that star grenade on you, but it would have also hit me.

[Speaker 3]
It would have been a kamikaze, I suppose.

[Speaker 8]
Next time.

[Speaker 3]
Next time.

[Speaker 4]
We also probably would have died too.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. It was fun playing with you. I will see you soon.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks for letting me see you. Thanks.

[Speaker 3]
Bye bye.

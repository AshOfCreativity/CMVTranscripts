[Speaker 3]
Hey, there we go. Yeah, that sounds like much less echo.

[Speaker 9]
Yay. What? Don't do it.

I know he's trying to call out, but he's not allowed. No, he's not going anywhere. He can go dumb.

Baby. Baby. Oh, are you serious?

He's very upset. I am. All right, there you go, miss.

Can you show everybody how beautiful you are? Oh, sorry, hi. I'm just trying to stand on my desk, which is not working.

Nope. Nope. Nope, you will sit in this exact position.

[Speaker 1]
I'm still told not to.

[Speaker 9]
He's like, but what if I just stick my claws into everything?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, you're going to behave.

[Speaker 2]
What if I just throw a big hissy fit?

[Speaker 9]
Nope, it's just immediately. You. All right.

Okay, it's squirming now. He's still squirming. Can't wait to get a face of utter despair version two.

There you go, there's a second version. This is fantastic cat content. There you go.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it's become a cat YouTuber, you know?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, we were talking about that because my visuals suck in my videos, so I might as well just switch to vtubing.

[Speaker 9]
Either we're going to go with the cowboy, uh, whatchamacallit, or uh, clothes cool.

[Speaker 3]
Your gelatinous rube would probably work really well. Very easy to animate.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, it's just a fucking cube. It just needs some like, uh. He'd just jiggle.

Just jiggles and like maybe a face that like kind of moves in different ways. I just need like a nice like Baron Harkonnen face. The kind of, uh, kind of displaced on his.

You know, look at the actor for like Baron Harkonnen, uh, in the new tune. It's literally just like, just the way like his lips move and they're always like slightly parted. I'm like, oh yeah, that's perfect.

Let's slap that right on top of that, right on top of the gelatinous cube. Now let me open some aid. And I think earlier some people.

Got some shit together.

[Speaker 7]
In a good way.

[Speaker 2]
And now we're going to need a map for anything that we're about to do.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so I am going to put a map down because.

[Speaker 2]
I might not be able to use a map, so I was just making sure that there's not like a battle map.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, it's not required. I mean, you guys are. You guys are free to use it as such, obviously.

There we go. And Frogather, are you on your phone, I'm guessing?

[Speaker 2]
I'm using Discord on my phone. Um, I'm looking for a mouse at my friend's house. Um, I left my mouse at home.

And I swear, I unplugged it from my computer to bring it here.

[Speaker 1]
And it's not here. Were you going to plug your mouse into your. Plug your mouse into your phone?

[Speaker 2]
My mouse. Into my, no, into my phone or my laptop.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the laptop should. The laptop does work with, uh, Foundry. You just have to.

[Speaker 2]
I, yeah, I just have, I don't know how to like.

[Speaker 1]
It's a two-finger click and drag. Meaning it works about half the time.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly. It just spins my character. She gets really dizzy.

[Speaker 1]
You have to like click outside because that's also the same thing for like scroll wheel. So you have to like.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. There used to be a module for it, but I don't think it's updated in forever.

[Speaker 2]
I can at least use my character sheet, so we'll be fine.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah, I'm away from the keyboard, but I'm on my headset doing some bedtime stuff with the baby.

[Speaker 9]
Hell yeah. Well, I know what it means to me.

[Speaker 2]
I wonder if this works. Oh, I'm going to try it.

[Speaker 8]
Excellent. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then, God, I'm still fucking starving. I'm probably going to grab like a little extra morsel to eat. But no, I'm going to put the kettle on.

Fuck it. I can have coffee whenever I want.

[Speaker 6]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right. If I'm doing work at two, what was it? I was, I was working.

I think I clocked in at like 12 something to three something last night. In the AM, just to get some shit done. I was like, I got to finish up this numbers reporting.

I want this ready for.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Cool. Yeah, you sound perfect.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Now I'm on my computer.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. All right. Okay.

We're going to go to the scenes. New scene.

[Speaker 7]
Red background.

[Speaker 1]
All right. So while we're looking at this, some of you guys were looking for some, some of you guys were looking for extra spellcasting materials or scrolls or magic items. From the sage.

And I did mention earlier that the nobleman was going to be, was going to provide a handsome ransom for his rescue.

[Speaker 9]
Yippee.

[Speaker 1]
So that's going to be the easy one here.

[Speaker 8]
Grid size. Set it to this. Changes.

So that's about. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 8]
Be just fine.

[Speaker 11]
Game. Um, and the approach that they've taken to why they changed this rule and why they changed the attack role was probably a, uh, a stupid marketing thing. I'm not necessarily going to give them a perfection of millennial nerd culture.

[Speaker 8]
Perfect. I got everything I need here.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm going to activate this. You guys are going to drop all of your tokens on the map here.

[Speaker 6]
You get to be unmuted for like 20, 30 minutes. Where are we dropping our tokens?

[Speaker 8]
Wherever you please.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'm off the map.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, fancy. Wherever you would like on the map. Oh, I've seen this map before.

[Speaker 2]
Will you forgive me if I just.

[Speaker 4]
I have too. I can see handcuffs in one of the rooms.

[Speaker 9]
That's. There's handcuffs right here on the table.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the, uh, apparently this is a brothel thing, but it was the right layout for, uh, for like an art gallery.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, the art gallery is actually a strip club.

[Speaker 1]
Plot twist of a century. Only on Saturday nights.

[Speaker 6]
I could have seen this coming. Excuse me, Melissa, coming out of one of the rooms.

[Speaker 4]
That's okay. We expect it by now. Oh, good.

[Speaker 7]
I like the whole chair set up.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. For, you know, somebody's giving a presentation.

[Speaker 7]
They're giving a presentation about the hits YouTuber gelatinous group.

[Speaker 8]
That's not where.

[Speaker 6]
Maelstrom is a name I can see being viral.

[Speaker 1]
The new mascot. Excellent. All right.

So you guys, I think what we discussed earlier. So you guys were going to enter the party with Lady Violet. And she was going to tell you guys about the, uh, she's going to basically give you guys the opportunity to explain yourselves, um, and kind of, and kind of get, think of this like an entrance interview, basically for speaking with the Oniromancer since she doesn't really want to talk to other people right now, but ostensibly you are good people.

They certainly did a good thing earlier today and a favor to her. So maybe this will get her out of her present recluse state.

[Speaker 2]
Is it just quiet? Or am I not able to? It is quiet.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry. I think everybody's basically waiting on me, but like my, I am so fucking hungry. I just gotta go get something to eat.

[Speaker 6]
Go get your tummy full.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Build that tum tum.

[Speaker 2]
What the fuck is hardware acceleration? It says your browser does not have hardware acceleration enabled. What does that mean?

What do I need to enable?

[Speaker 6]
Are you using Opera?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'm using, um, what, what, what am I using? Huh? What were you asking?

[Speaker 6]
Are you using the Opera? Oh, um, cause I had that problem when I used Opera. Edge.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Nobody bring up the Microsoft.

[Speaker 6]
Um, I just got this PC. Never don't use Microsoft Edge. It's bullshit.

Firefox is the best. Um, I can also send you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Send her all the stuff. Firefox is probably your best bet, but I also did find a Foundry, like.

Solo client, kind of. And that's what I use. And I found that it reduced my lag, like so goddamn much.

[Speaker 6]
Why haven't you told me? I did tell you about it.

[Speaker 3]
You ignored me.

[Speaker 6]
I didn't ignore you. Oh, I'm going to say that.

[Speaker 3]
I was like, this is going to be, she probably showed me here. I'll put it into a voice overflow. It's by, um, the ripper 93, which is a pretty common name in the, uh, module sphere of Foundry.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, let me check that out.

[Speaker 6]
When did you send this to me?

[Speaker 3]
I think I was excitedly telling you about how it solved my lag problems.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I bet I thought it was for you only. Like, like people who bought Foundry only.

[Speaker 3]
I think I sent it in Dungeons and Otters at some point.

[Speaker 2]
I specifically unplugged my mouse to take it with me. And I left it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, when you said you were at your friends looking for a mouse, I thought you were looking for like, a mouse.

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Like a squeak squeak.

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Perhaps it would help. Emotional support mouse. Oh, yes.

[Speaker 2]
They're so tiny.

[Speaker 3]
And soft. We have a friend who really didn't like rodents very much. And then during a game, I turned her god into a mouse and had her keep him as a pet.

And now she loves them.

[Speaker 4]
Your friend hates mice? Easy solution. Turn their deity into a mouse.

Mouse.

[Speaker 3]
Their deity was, um, Ill Mater as well.

[Speaker 4]
I'm like, really?

[Speaker 3]
When do I download? Um, it should have taken you to the VTT client. Yes.

Does it come up with more when you open it?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
You, you scroll down, it says what's changed, and it says assets. And then it has a list of...

[Speaker 3]
So the easiest one, um, it is the VTT Desktop Client Windows 64X Portable. Um, portable means that you don't have to actually, like, do any physical installs. You can just extract the, uh, thing to its own little folder, and then just run it straight from there.

Um, so that'll be the fastest setup. Um, but if you want to install it, then the setup.exe is the one you would want. Are there any benefits doing either?

I honestly have no idea. There's not really any reason not to do the portable. Why does James have an air raid siren going off?

Oh, you know.

[Speaker 7]
Concerned.

[Speaker 2]
America things.

[Speaker 9]
He's returned.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so we're back. Uh, we were talking about setting you guys up in an art gallery here, and a party that was happening this very night. So you guys were told that, or sorry, you guys were instructed to meet Lady Violet here, as you have.

There is a dwarven act as you guys arrive, stepping up onto the stage, and there are a number of small, um, there are a number of, like, there are a number of small pyramid-shaped or onyx-crafted artifacts displayed on different pedestals and daises, hidden behind some nearly invisible glass that's floating with these artifacts, uh, floating in the center of them themselves. Kind of like a floating crystal ball versus a, and then you have the artifact inside itself. And there are little viewing benches and couches, bedding, etc.

all around these, uh, all around these different daises, so that people can just kind of lounge around and watch presentations on them. There are programmed illusions connected to each daise. Besides that, people are just kind of drinking and, uh, getting familiar with each other.

It's at this point that Lady Violet is going to approach... Actually, how am I going to use this? Screw it, let's use...

I'm just going to use Lady Evelyne again. No, no, I'm not going to do that. Come on, that's a bad idea.

[Speaker 4]
We'll get our ladies all mixed up.

[Speaker 1]
What if I, yeah, what if I need her again?

[Speaker 7]
Where there's a party, there must be food. And I'm curious to see what you can come up with in terms of bites to eat.

[Speaker 1]
Bites to eat? Here, with the Egyptian theme, it's primarily, it's a lot of cows. It is a lot of kind of red heifers that have been slain.

And all of them are somewhere between, all of them are cooked for the most part, but they've been sprinkled with spices to make them look like they've been, uh, to make them look as if they actually haven't been cooked. So, like, everything's red when you look at them. Or, sorry, all the steaks themselves are, like, really, really red, but not like a wet red, kind of like a dry red, like somebody painted them over with red gold.

Almost. A fucking love steak, I'm digging it.

[Speaker 3]
Pandory chicken style.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, thank you. Yeah, and so Lady Evelyn is going to approach, or sorry, god damn it. Lady Violet is going to come in here.

She's wearing some, oh, there we go. She's wearing some simple robes. And some light jewelry.

Thank you. Thank you. So, we, as we discussed, you wish to- My attempt at zooming in.

Oh, no, you have to, Kera, you have to click outside the token, and then you can- You have to click outside the token.

[Speaker 9]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 1]
You have to click and drag outside, like, deselect your token, and then you can- Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Are you alright?

[Speaker 2]
You're all turned around. She's been drinking. Alright, let's fake it right side up.

We got this.

[Speaker 4]
You did it once, you can do it again. And just as an FYI, you can lock your token so this doesn't happen again.

[Speaker 1]
That's not how that works. If I'm drunk and I fall over, I can't, you can't be like, you can right side up again.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's the best I'm gonna get.

[Speaker 1]
Once I crash on the counter, don't drive, no. Well, so you had a number of different- I'm told that the noble you rescued earlier will be approaching with his reward. He's probably not really well enough to travel, but he insisted.

So, good news for us. And tell me now, what is it that you were so intent on discussing with Lady Hissene?

[Speaker 3]
Well, we know of a threat to the north, um, a shivagroth. I'm not sure if you- well, from your reaction, it sounds like you might know. I'm- And we know there's multiple.

[Speaker 1]
That actually, that does get like a legitimately, uh, the first sign of shock that you've seen on her face so far. Remember, you dragged a body out of this, out in front of this woman, not 12 hours ago. After, after, say, uh, sending her a message about how there was a werewolf chasing you folks.

So she's not super surprised as of yet. But this has actually gotten her to kind of like, hesitate and be like, oh, oh shit. You know, fades pretty quickly thereafter.

[Speaker 10]
Um, but I communed with my god and he said that the, um, one emancer might be able to help. Oh, I'm, um, killing you.

[Speaker 1]
I see. And which god do you worship here?

[Speaker 10]
Uh, twicelinger.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay. I see.

[Speaker 1]
Herald of one of the draconic gods then. Okay. Well then, you said that we could help.

What do you know about the shivagroth so far?

[Speaker 3]
Um, they are big.

[Speaker 10]
They're scary.

[Speaker 3]
Um, they, uh, deal with madness. Um, hang on a second while I scroll up in my brain.

[Speaker 2]
Flip through all the tabs.

[Speaker 8]
After an excellent start so far.

[Speaker 3]
Um, I was told that the, um, the dreaming states, uh, makes you vulnerable to the shivagroth.

[Speaker 10]
Um, and the simplest would be to, since undead don't dream, to do that. But, um, making a bunch of people undead to fight it might be a little difficult. A little bit, um, not great.

[Speaker 1]
You must be truly worried about this if you're seriously considering turning yourself undead to fight it.

[Speaker 6]
It is a big threat.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, it is.

[Speaker 8]
All right, so I've been given some more information.

[Speaker 1]
I was told to grab that. Okay. Anyways.

You're quite correct that it's a, it's a deadly, devastating threat. Have you... It's the sort of thing that can harm you just by virtue of having been struck.

Not to mention what the, uh, not to mention like a hundred mealy mouths trying to swarm you at once.

[Speaker 10]
We fought an undead one once.

[Speaker 8]
You fought an undead one?

[Speaker 10]
It was like a mummy.

[Speaker 8]
Huh.

[Speaker 3]
And we killed it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's certainly encouraging. Tell me, what exactly do you, so you know the shivagroths? How did you find out about this one?

[Speaker 10]
Well, uh, you know that meteor up north?

[Speaker 1]
There are several comets and meteors scattered around Zmaid.

[Speaker 3]
Well, one of them has the shivagroth. We went with Zephain on his ballad. And...

[Speaker 1]
That catches a negative reaction from her.

[Speaker 10]
We found out that it's kind of causing problems.

[Speaker 1]
It was no surprise that the, uh, the bastards of Zephain would have allied himself with something so horrific. It's uncharacteristic, it's uncommon for a Fae to do such a thing.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think he's doing it willingly.

[Speaker 1]
Don't think it's doing it willingly.

[Speaker 6]
It doesn't seem like he knows that there's one there.

[Speaker 1]
Like he doesn't know that, how would he not be aware of it?

[Speaker 6]
I don't know if right now is the time or place to get into that?

[Speaker 1]
Now is absolutely the time or place, because...

[Speaker 10]
Well, I mean, if it causes madness, wouldn't that be a form of madness?

[Speaker 1]
I suppose. We're loathe to give Zephain any excuses. But it's possible to convert what was already a power mad and it seemed desire for control onto the, into his current plan, so sure.

No, I don't believe that was all. Was there anything else that you were coming to discuss tonight?

[Speaker 3]
Kara looks at Mimosa.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, yes, my, is not as noble as my dear sweet Kara's. I'm looking, I'm looking for a dagger, a glass dagger.

[Speaker 1]
Looking for a glass dagger, I'm sure you could find one at any antique shop.

[Speaker 6]
No, like a, a powerful glass dagger from an assassin's guild?

[Speaker 1]
From an assassin's guild, and what business would you have, dearest Mimosa, with an assassin's guild?

[Speaker 6]
I want a dagger from them to use for my own.

[Speaker 8]
I see.

[Speaker 6]
I've been looking for one individual that I crossed paths with that enlightened me to the dagger. And he may have been asking for me, but I would like one.

[Speaker 1]
Very well, very well. And the rest of you, you've all been awfully quiet. You wish to speak with a sage, what is it that you wish to discuss?

[Speaker 4]
Well, I was wondering if they could help us divine where a couple items of great amounts of power are, but...

[Speaker 1]
Well, sages can certainly do that. I'm sure Lady Hissene wouldn't object.

[Speaker 4]
I am going to point out that some people weren't on the ballad, so they're just hearing the, oh yeah, right, the effect of fey, apparently power hungry fey is just being helped, that's neat.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, neat is exactly the word we use for it, we're not, as I said, it's, we're not...

[Speaker 6]
I wouldn't exactly say it's helping him, it's using him. I see. So the point is, is we need to get rid of that, because it's giving him more power and twisting his brain.

To do things that the Shivarath wants. So we need to get rid of that to lessen what Zathain is doing.

[Speaker 8]
On this, I'm sure we can agree, yes.

[Speaker 6]
If it helped, he had a moment of clarity where he asked us for help. Like a... Like he came out of whatever hold the Shivarath has on him, and he asked us to help to get rid of it for him, because he doesn't actually like what's happening.

[Speaker 1]
I wouldn't be surprised, the fey are tricky, and I've, quite frankly, I would expect this to just be a prank, but...

[Speaker 3]
We did see the Shivarath, so that at least is a real...

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, absolutely, it's disgusting.

[Speaker 1]
I believe you.

[Speaker 6]
Since we've already fought one, we do know what it looks like.

[Speaker 1]
Lady Hasim, more importantly, perhaps, believes you. Yes, yes, I think that we will. I think that we will assist you here.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 8]
Just, of course, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, Mech, at this point you have arrived. Go ahead and drop your character down. There, ready.

I'm just gonna load things in real quick. Lady Hasim is going to take everyone to a slightly more... Yeah, a slightly more private area.

[Speaker 2]
Garrus, we're moving. Huh?

[Speaker 8]
Garrus, you think we're being taken to the sage?

[Speaker 6]
I would assume that's exactly what's happening.

[Speaker 9]
We're moving.

[Speaker 2]
I got this. Yay, we did it. I'm getting the hang of this.

Hold on.

[Speaker 6]
What you could also do, which is some shortcuts I have to do, if you hit ctrl and then use the arrow keys, you can move the map around. And then you can move, as long as it's short distances, you can move your token with the arrow keys.

[Speaker 7]
I feel bad for everyone.

[Speaker 6]
That way you don't have to mess with the keypad or the mousepad.

[Speaker 2]
I think I actually got the hang of the mousepad. It's just gonna be... Not tricky, but muscle memory needs to...

[Speaker 7]
An adjustment.

[Speaker 2]
Think in. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
An adjustment.

[Speaker 7]
The game I was in earlier had to end early because one person didn't show up, and another had to drop out pretty early. So that's a shame. So we were just running around with three people in there.

What a shame. So, everybody else in the actors list, do y'all see Crack's homunculus servant?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I do. Yes.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I was wondering if everybody else saw that.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes that happens. Sorry, where? In your actors tab.

I'm guessing that it's just... It got imported and it got given to everyone. That used to happen a lot.

I also see a draconic spirit. I don't think that's mine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I see that one too. That's what pops up before I open my character tab. First time that my character tab was closed and those two were popping up, I was like, oh my god, what has happened to all of my characters?

They're gone. They've been replaced.

[Speaker 3]
You've been turned into a draconic spirit and a homunculus servant. Yeah, I mean, I guess I can work with this, but...

[Speaker 4]
Ones that used to pop up previously that weren't, even before it got to anything, was just a skeleton. A single one. And I was just like, now, how?

[Speaker 3]
They all have one. There was a person whose character showed up on everybody's as an observer thing, and I finally, when James gave me a referee account, I finally just went and made it so he was owned by himself and nobody else, because I got so tired of seeing his stupid face. Being haunted by him.

I don't remember what guy it was. I don't think he plays anymore, but I remember his character was just listed as available for everyone.

[Speaker 1]
Do you remember which character it was?

[Speaker 3]
I don't. I remember him vaguely anime-ish and kind of an edgy lord type character. Which does not narrow it down.

Maybe it was Yasker? It was one of those guys. That does sound familiar.

Yeah, I think it might have been Yasker, because I remember it was just constantly there.

[Speaker 1]
Make yourself a green name monk character. Oh, so maybe not Silmasoul, but another one. It might have been one of the guys I booted in this mid-session.

That would have been funny.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god. But I eventually removed him from being owned by everybody.

[Speaker 2]
You had to kick someone mid-session?

[Speaker 1]
I've done it a couple times now, and it feels better each time. He's getting addicted.

[Speaker 2]
But what did they do to get kicked? Were they just obnoxious?

[Speaker 1]
So the last one was being a real shithead.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, that's why it's gone. Okay, so I need to scroll up.

[Speaker 5]
Shithead.

[Speaker 8]
I see, I see.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they just kept interrupting shit constantly. Never letting people interact with others around the table. Constantly getting shit.

Like, misremembering simple shit in a way that made me think they weren't misremembering it, but they were just trying to tell me something that happened that didn't happen.

[Speaker 3]
I remember one guy kept trying to, like, jump off a ledge.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of.

[Speaker 12]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And, like, he kept interrupting. And I think you read him, and he died.

[Speaker 1]
Like, every two seconds that he was doing it. I took him out, and I told him, hey, stop doing this. And then he kept doing it, and I was like, all right.

You're gone. Ah, that was fun. Anyways, yeah, so Lady Asine is going to be approaching here.

Drag her in. Just another fucking monster.

[Speaker 4]
You know, for people who leave badly, you turn them into villains. For people who leave well, do you turn them into anything?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, usually, like, NPCs and stuff like that. Usually people who leave well aren't really leaving. They're just kind of around.

[Speaker 2]
Um. Like Armorin. I had a friend that joined and then left.

So now I own his character. Yeah, pretty much.

[Speaker 3]
If they leave well, there's no reason to remember them, um, with a villain. Exactly. No reason to constantly be beating them up.

[Speaker 1]
Or Moth. That's exactly what it is. So Lady Asine here appears sitting next to you guys on the couch cushions.

She's a very tall one elf. Probably close to about 6'4", and just wearing very simple, elegant robes with a large jacket over top. And she has a veil covering most of her face.

[Speaker 8]
Let's see here. As well, you've requested an audience. I suppose everybody should be grateful.

[Speaker 1]
This is, I haven't taken clients or seen anyone for quite some time, but you rescued me, at the very least, from a little bit of my despair when it came to poor Rose. Tell me, do you know how she died?

[Speaker 6]
Not exactly. We have some strong leads.

[Speaker 8]
I see.

[Speaker 6]
We were pretty sure a werewolf, but then when we followed the clues, it also led us to a vampire den. So, werewolf, vampire.

[Speaker 1]
I see. Well, that's closer than anyone else has gotten as of late. There's been enough other crimes that an unimportant person's murder has not been properly investigated.

There's too many other problems in the face of a populist to really care about a handyman. I appreciate what you did, giving selfish motives or no. I really do appreciate you having investigated her death.

Gotten closer than anyone else to discovering why she had to die.

[Speaker 6]
Of course, we couldn't just leave it.

[Speaker 1]
We couldn't. So?

[Speaker 6]
Couldn't just leave her.

[Speaker 1]
You've told me about the Shivercroft here, and I have good news and bad news. The good news is, like, there are means of defending yourself against the Shivercroft Spiders. I believe you mentioned earlier.

I don't know if you quite understood the portents that you were given by your deity, but to give you what was likely the message, based on my own dreamings, is you can battle with it at the center of your own mind. This can be carried away from its physical form, and if something should happen to you in the process, you would be able to, um, well, it wouldn't be instant death. It probably wouldn't be death at all, were you watched over and handled with care.

But if this were, the trouble is you could become, you could make yourself more vulnerable to it, should you fail. It's not an easy process. And frankly, I'm surprised you didn't go, you didn't decide to seek out the city of the dead and weighing your alternatives.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but a couple of you have been there already.

[Speaker 10]
Where is that?

[Speaker 1]
Here in Ammar.

[Speaker 10]
I think I have.

[Speaker 6]
I want to say Para has, definitely. When we did Canthasia's ballad.

[Speaker 1]
Kaleen.

[Speaker 8]
Kaleen.

[Speaker 1]
Because Kaleen is the one that's dead.

[Speaker 9]
Which one's I there?

[Speaker 1]
So she's in the city of the dead.

[Speaker 2]
Did any of my characters go there?

[Speaker 6]
I would say you were.

[Speaker 3]
I think it might have been Kibi though. Okay. You took Kibi on a lot of adventures.

[Speaker 1]
There were a lot of girl's rights sessions around that time. You guys were fighting a baby made of baby toys. A giant baby.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my God. I completely forgot about that. Oh, that baby.

[Speaker 1]
Tasty. Now speaking character. Okay.

Yes. So tell me, tell me what you want to describe. Tell me what you want me to describe first.

I could probably speak all day on this subject.

[Speaker 2]
When you say fight in the center of the mind, what's best? What sort of attributes are best needed to fight this thing at the center of your mind?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you have to excel at something or else you have no hope whatsoever. But those with a strong will, those with those with a strong force of personality, or those who simply whose intellect is a keen intellect is probably the worst of the three to actually keep you alive. But it's better than nothing.

And of course, if you have any of these and many strong, if you have more than one of these in strong measure, then you can, you can hope to succeed. The way the battle at the center of your mind works is generally something like a puzzle that the two of you are trying to solve at the same time. And each of your decisions will interfere with the others.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, that's fun.

[Speaker 1]
If you succeed, you'll be immunized, not from any of its physical dangers, but you will be immunized from the effects of its madness, which are quite potent nearby and can enthrall you rather quickly.

[Speaker 10]
And it can only be done one at a time?

[Speaker 1]
Generally. Generally, you can only participate one at a time.

[Speaker 10]
I guess you can't split its mind across like 20.

[Speaker 1]
This is true. If you attacked it more than... I honestly hadn't considered that.

If you were to do more than one at a given time, then it would be spread somewhat thin. It would put less focus on... It would put...

At that point, it would put less focus on winning the puzzle and more focus on harming you outright. But it could be distracting. There are other means of contributing.

I don't have access to the spell myself, but if you're able to... There are spells that will take you to other worlds, and one such world that you could name would be a plane of existence. You would have to imagine it, and you would have to call something from that plane into being.

But if you did, you would be able to conjure a center of the mind, a center of its mind to fight in. But they're few and far between. Dream of the...

Dream of the Blue Veil. Could work. Probably would work.

Probably the easiest of them. Plane Shift would require a... Plane Shift would definitely require a tuning fork.

The Gate Spell could work.

[Speaker 10]
Any attuning fork or a specific tuning fork?

[Speaker 1]
It would have to be attuned to the center of the creature's mind. As a plane might not actually exist, whereas Dream of the Blue Veil, you could try to call... You could try to call something from the aberration's mind, bring it here, and then use that to transport yourself within.

That's not really how the, you know, how Plane Shift works, but it is a means that... You could use Dream Logic, but Dream of the Blue Veil. But nobody's surprised.

And I could likely... I could likely assist you with this.

[Speaker 6]
That would be wonderful. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And if all else fails, well, there is the City of Tir Nammal.

[Speaker 9]
What's up with that?

[Speaker 1]
You know, the City of the Dead. Well, that's where wraiths come to rest, or unrest, if you will. People who haven't quite finished their business on Earth or who have been turned by other wraiths need to go somewhere.

And so Tir Nammal, in this place in the world... Tir Nammal is where they go. A hollow, or a pockmarked, rotten branch of the World Tree.

Not even a branch, it's really a stump at this point. But it's where the corrupted go to rest if... You know, normally, like for instance, Fae Spirits, you've interacted with Kaleen.

Fae Spirits typically reform in the Fae Wild, but if they've been corrupted in some way, they've lost their essence, or if it's been changed, then they can't properly return. So... Basically, anything that's been...

Anything whose soul or spirit has been tainted in the way that it has, it shouldn't be. Get sent to Tir Nammal, or at the very least, sinks there. The last place that will accept them ends.

Should you go there, only the dead can survive there, so you would become undead in the process. From there, you would try to call the spirit to its gates. And then you would fight it at the city's gates.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, did you just say something about becoming undead?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. The risk there would be the risk that you couldn't actually leave. You would have to repossess your own bodies.

And there's no way to guarantee that it works. It's a pure matter of chance.

[Speaker 6]
So this would be our absolute last option.

[Speaker 1]
It depends on how much you dislike being undead. It wouldn't be the first time somebody embraced... It wouldn't be the first time somebody turned themselves in the pursuit of a hunt like this.

[Speaker 2]
Of somebody that might, but again, last resort.

[Speaker 1]
But those options are available to us. For the Dream of the Blue Veil, I would just...

[Speaker 9]
Hmm.

[Speaker 8]
Anyways, where would I send you? Oh no, I'm there.

[Speaker 1]
I have a few ideas of where I would send you. Are you familiar with the creatures known as Mind Flyers?

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Right. We would use one of their colonies in this pursuit. We've been able to, um...

I've actually done this ritual once before, but it was for the sake of fighting one of the colony's controlling masters, an Elder Brain. I did it recently, again with a second Elder Brain. In fact, tonight, you should be able to...

Hmm. Does anybody wish to take a walk with me outside? Absolutely.

Yes. Do you love brains? Because I do believe it's about time for this to happen.

She walks outside and just kind of, like, points... It doesn't really, like, go past the door, obviously. It just kind of, like, points outside, or upwards.

And you guys can see a few blinking flashes of light. And they're getting larger, larger, and larger. Until they're, you know, they're larger than stars.

Not as big as the moons, but larger than stars. Though not by much. And, uh, just, you end up seeing two groups of these lights approach.

One from the south, and one from the north. Then you see a bunch of smaller flashes of light start trading between them. So, that's a more recent client with another Elder Brain.

[Speaker 2]
That light?

[Speaker 8]
Indeed.

[Speaker 2]
Is a brain.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, one of them is. Or in a vessel that's holding a brain.

[Speaker 2]
We're all vessels holding brains.

[Speaker 1]
We're not, but let's turn to more positive matters, I suppose. It's not only, you know, possible death that you're seeking. Some of you are looking for treasure in the meantime.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, learned one. I am a humble wizard of the Bladesinging school. Which, um, which I believe may have some powerful artifacts or weapons of legend scattered throughout this land.

But I've been able, been unable to locate any in my research thus far. I was wondering if you could, uh, assist me with your greater capacity.

[Speaker 1]
I would be happy to, if for no reason other than the fact it will assist the, uh, it will assist certainly the rest of everyone's goal. But as a favor to you, ah, there is the Dreaming Spear. There's a number of Dreaming artifacts that are scattered throughout the land.

I was, uh, at one time I was, I called the White Orchid Cairn home and they held a few Dreaming artifacts. One of which is right in front of us.

[Speaker 3]
Here, I'll show it off for a clip.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It was, uh, the aspect of Dreaming changed throughout the ages, but it's been called both the Middle Ages and the Middle Ages. The Midnight Spear and the Gloaming Spear.

It is, it lies beneath the Well of Stars. It lies beneath, it lies beneath all of the Abyss. It is at the, the Abyss is, is infinite, but it does have a bottom.

You merely need to cast yourself off to the layer, uh, uh, transport yourself to the bottom, rather than any number of the infinite between. And it came to rest in a horrific Demon Post Pal. One of the first to actually spawn from that plane to begin with.

And it rests in its chest, holding it there, binding it there. Now, if you take the spear, it awakens. But it's at the bottom of the Abyss.

And the, more importantly, the powers it bestows upon the wielder are permanent. They never fade once the, once they've attuned, once they've been accepted by the spear itself, the powers of the spear never fade.

[Speaker 5]
Potent indeed.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Hera here has already been to the Well of Stars, but in case you forget, it is hidden, it is beneath the library that used to belong to the Wizard Israfel.

[Speaker 4]
Um, the place where we went fishing.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
It's a good spot to cast Catch Dungeon Drum, assuming you're not fishing for actual stars. Of course, it's good for that as well.

[Speaker 9]
Hmm.

[Speaker 8]
Well then, who next?

[Speaker 4]
My... Oh, you can go first.

[Speaker 7]
My prospects aren't as, uh, grand as a Dreaming Spear, but, um, a magical item.

[Speaker 1]
I could tell that just looking at you. That's right. I guess an Ophish boot wants something that's going to help him live longer, live an extra minute or so in the face of horrific, impossible odds.

And cares for nothing else. You'd be correct. Are you a mind reader?

Are you an esper? I'm a sage. And something of the second as well.

Or something of the former as well.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, superior up to wound closure. I've been trying to find one, but they keep eluding me.

[Speaker 1]
They do, they do indeed. Well, tell me. How do you intend to...

All right, and this is where the puzzle folks, uh, starts, folks. Um, this lady is kind of really unsure about you people and about your intentions. And whether or not you would become...

Basically, especially if we're intending to fight the Shivergroth, she's wondering, okay, are you guys going to become... assets to either Zephain or the powers beyond? Or are you going to actually...

Are you going to maintain your own will? And then further, I guess, one step further removed from that, how are you going to use that will? So she's unsure about you.

Tell me.

[Speaker 2]
I don't like the bet.

[Speaker 1]
You could take the Harriet from someone else. You could steal it. And this would involve bloodshed.

You could steal it from someone else involving no bloodshed. Or you could discover it through a great deal of bloodshed.

[Speaker 2]
I would try to avoid bloodshed.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, this question is for Corpus alone. How would you prefer to do this? You're free to obviously encourage him one way or the other, but...

What she means is that only he can answer.

[Speaker 2]
Still would have said that out loud.

[Speaker 7]
An item like this would further allow me to protect not only myself, but by keeping myself alive, protect my allies as well.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. So do you intend to kill someone else for it? Sorry, do you intend to harm someone else for it?

Do you intend to, uh, you tend to take it under the cover of night? Or do you intend to harm a great deal of, maybe not people, but monsters? Who knows what's in between?

To pull one out of the earth.

[Speaker 7]
Corpus thinks to a moment before answering.

[Speaker 1]
In a way that has as little bloodshed as possible. I see, so you wish to steal it. Indeed.

I see. Well, I can tell you now that one of the artifacts behind us is a fake. Well, many of them are, but more importantly the one you're looking for is a fake, the one that's suspended in a crystal ball.

There is a curator coming near the top, uh, there's a curator standing near the back end with, uh, with his teaching assistant. And he and, he and she are somewhat, uh, he and she are somewhat engrossed with one another right now. So if you wish to take a period of wound closure from his breast pocket, you should, could surely sneak up on him and do so.

That's where the actual artifact is. Has the same function as a period of wound closure, it's just cold.

[Speaker 7]
I nod and say thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Here. Let's return inside. To go back in.

[Speaker 2]
Do we use encumbrance?

[Speaker 7]
So who's the person I'm looking for?

[Speaker 2]
Because like all my gold is taken up on my dam. Encumbrance.

[Speaker 7]
I like it.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so who's this person I'm looking for? There's just, go ahead and make me a sleight of hand. They're over by the, uh, top, how's it, the, uh, top left area.

All right.

[Speaker 2]
Um, uh, so they're, they're distracted, right? While you're doing this.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, so you make a slight of hand check with advantage.

[Speaker 7]
17.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you reach in, you, uh, you don't even have to, it's a private area and you don't really even have to worry about, uh, filtering it from something he's actively wearing. Apparently he's been losing clothes during this, uh, for the past half hour. But yeah, so you snag the hat.

Harriet, and you notice that it's virtually identical to, uh, virtually identical to one of these objects inside the balls.

[Speaker 7]
Looks beautiful.

[Speaker 2]
When you get back over, I'll pat you on the back because that was cool.

[Speaker 6]
So then, who's next?

[Speaker 4]
I can go next. And that's the person with, who wants to, Farshad wants to go first.

[Speaker 9]
Nessie muted, so.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, sorry, what? I'm just defaulting on muting because two of my kids are up and they're loud.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. Why don't you have a thing you wanted from her?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, I wanted to know about the assassin, assassins for hire that special, that use glass daggers.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I'm sure I could help you here. At this moment, a pilgrim, a man in white robes who's, uh, has a number of different kind of fetishes and charms dangling from his bracelets and from his neck. It walks in and has a, you know, he has the insignia of a snake on the back of his cloak and is walking around observing the different artifacts.

He might be able to help you, but I'll call him in later. Of course. You see, he's been marked for death by the assassins, just like you have.

You see that?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'm sorry, what? I've been marked?

[Speaker 1]
Well, yes, you see that mark on your left hand, don't you?

[Speaker 2]
Has anyone else been marked?

[Speaker 1]
Has anyone else been marked? Of course. They don't kill as many people here as they do in other places, but there's still plenty of coin to be earned at home.

[Speaker 2]
How does one get marked? How do they mark you?

[Speaker 6]
I mean, I fought one of them a while ago. That's probably where I got marked. Oh, dear.

[Speaker 2]
Well, we have to deal with that.

[Speaker 1]
She's wearing the ink on her left hand here. And I've seen a confrontation they'll engage for the second time. The secret to finding these people is tricky, but they are in a sharehouse, or at the very least a kind of upside down of a sharehouse.

[Speaker 6]
An upside down of a sharehouse?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Beneath the sewers of this place? I'm sure there are other places you could access it, but those are known only to other assassins.

Beneath the sewers of a sharehouse, further down and further down, if you go to a place where a number of different alchemical reagents have collected into a pool, fish around in there for a little while, you should stumble into something that feels like... You should stumble into a bit of the, I won't say water, the liquid, that feels solid. Perfectly, perfectly cylindrical in shape.

A mirror. But it's just under the surface of the water. Just under the surface of the water, I should say.

If you plunge yourself in at that exact spot, you will come up on the other side to a version of a sharehouse that is flooded, largely uninhabited, and very, very sick. You'll see more wraiths from Tir Na Marr there than you will in other places. You'll fit in idly.

[Speaker 6]
That's where they are?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Your glass man here used to, your glass man here has taken on the identity of someone who used to live in a shop in Ensamade a long time ago, but is apparently dead. It was a serial killer who wielded a dagger made of glass and made a number of large sacrifices to...

People thought they were demons at the time, but they were horrors apparitions.

[Speaker 6]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
Eventually, he settled down in a cabin in the woods inside the cloud forest. And a man on the other side of the world, who was something of a talented assassin already, found himself in prison. In prison, in a place that nobody could possibly hope to escape from.

A frozen prison in the middle of a freezing salt sea, itself surrounded by nothing but glaciers and ice all around. The food was teleported in, and as was the water. The guards, there were barely any guards there.

The prisoners themselves were kept in a state of stasis for most of their term. Just something to numb the pain of slowly freezing to death and sort of the process. Oh, in case they were needed for later.

He eventually discovered, or was gifted, I'm not really sure how, the ability to transmit himself through mirrors, reflective surfaces. And he used this to transport himself across the glaciers. And eventually, he found himself up next to the mage college of Smaed, specifically the glass mages.

Oh, hi buddy, there you are.

[Speaker 8]
Hi.

[Speaker 1]
Long story short, he arrived, I believe he killed a professor, or an adjunct professor, at the stained glass mage college. Stole some research from one of the former professors at that college, someone who was taking a, they were taking a vacation. I believe they have relatives out there.

Do you know anyone from the stained glass college?

[Speaker 6]
Okay, just the hires, right? Like we hired.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, Arthur and Jimmy.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Yes, we hired some students, Arthur and Jimmy from there.

[Speaker 1]
Arthur and Jimmy, I know one of them. I know the mage I'm talking about had a nephew named Arthur.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, that sounds, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yeah, one of them had a nephew named Arthur. Anyways, he's currently on vacation, should be coming back soon. But after this knife, this assassin teleported himself in, he stole some research from the wizard's tower, went on to kill the original serial killer by reverse engineering some of the sacrifices, took on his identity, and founded an assassin's guild in Asherus.

That's about the same time he found or was gifted this upside down world copy of the city.

[Speaker 8]
That's a piece of operations.

[Speaker 1]
Very expensive assassins. I'm told, though I was never able to confirm, you know Baroness Sierra, right?

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, Baroness Sierra received an offer to kill Banessus for approximately 10,000 gold pieces. Well, this is many months back.

[Speaker 6]
I thought I was muted, I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 1]
In short, you could find the place, the original place I mentioned. Yeah, you find the original place I mentioned, the place beneath the sewers in order to get inside of the underground realm, or you could teleport there from somewhere else. My warning to you is, be careful.

Entering is not the difficult part for people of your skill. The difficult part is that wherever you enter from is from where you will be chased. And of course the knife himself has enemies inside of this realm.

Pags, witches, and ghosts are more than abundant. What do you wish to do to him anyways? Are you trying to kill him, or are you just trying to take?

Let me ask you, if you want this dagger so bad, what's... Name a person at this table that you'd be willing to give up for the sake of getting that dagger. And one person whom you wouldn't.

You heard me. Name one person at this table you'd be willing to give up to get at the dagger. And then name one person whom you wouldn't be willing to give up.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not going to give up anybody.

[Speaker 1]
I see. Is there anyone you especially wouldn't give up for the sake of the dagger?

[Speaker 2]
Wow, he's trying to get you to play favorites.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, not... No, Mimosa has a favorite. That's not the point.

Why does it matter who I wouldn't give up? Why?

[Speaker 1]
Because I'm a sage and I deal in knowledge and information.

[Speaker 6]
All right. I especially wouldn't give up Para. She's my niece.

I see.

[Speaker 8]
Family, you know that.

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Family is very important.

[Speaker 8]
Unsurprising.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. All right. Well, have I satisfied your request for knowledge?

[Speaker 3]
You have, thank you.

[Speaker 8]
You still have.

[Speaker 3]
No, there's a couple people I think who...

[Speaker 6]
Well, you've satisfied my request for knowledge.

[Speaker 8]
Well then, who's next?

[Speaker 4]
I'll go next. I was wondering if you knew where tomes of clear thoughts are kept. And I guess a couple others like the more powerful staff of the magi and manuals of bodily health, but obviously ones that work.

After all, stuff like tomes of clear thoughts are coveted.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, you may ask for one.

[Speaker 4]
That's fair. That's fair. All right.

Staff of the magi, though?

[Speaker 1]
Is that your choice?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Look, a middle there.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, that's my selection.

[Speaker 5]
I could go for it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm sorry. I am very tired.

No, that's totally fine. I know. It's...

Well, I'm not going to stop making fun of you, but I'm just saying I understand that it's like 3 a.m. It's 5. Anyways. Staff of the magi.

Would you prefer to acquire this through some... Tell me, would you prefer to grease someone's palms to get this item? Would you prefer to...

How do I book this? You could either grease someone's palms to get this, or say you could acquire it not create it, but acquire it by virtue of an invention.

[Speaker 9]
Do you mean by...

[Speaker 8]
Or you could choose to wish it into existence.

[Speaker 4]
It would be delightful if I could wish it to existence, but I'm assuming that's beyond me, because as of right now it is. I guess making it would be a better option.

[Speaker 1]
I'm asking, what is your choice? Like, what is your preference?

[Speaker 4]
I would like to wish it into existence. It's the faster of the three, no?

[Speaker 8]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
Towards the northeast corner of Simaid, once you get into the mountains, there is an ancient city that's been long, long lost, and souls that have been lost longer still, hidden inside clockwork automata, waltzing streets that no longer have a purpose, and warrens that have forgotten their proper shape. In one of these warrens, inside one of these warrens, there is an old wizard's laboratory. Not the one, not the one that was in charge of this city, but one of his advisors.

They give you an idea of, I suppose, the ruler of this ancient city. His advisors have a staff of the mad guy, one of them.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
And if you wish to have that staff, at the very bottom, at the very bottom of a place known as the hidden bluff, inside a, inside of a statue of a dwarven hero, lies a lamp. Then if you were to, if you were to rub some dust off of the lamp, which maintains itself even though the vessel is underwater, you would be able to have such a thing.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
The exact wording you must use is, I wish for the staff of Kugol the Magi.

[Speaker 4]
Can you spell that for me? Yes. Thank you.

I wish for the staff of Kugol. Okay. Cool.

I appreciate that.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
I need one person who has not gone yet to make a, to make some kind of perception or investigation check, because I assume, I assume that you're kind of hanging out or maybe flitting back and forth with one of these.

[Speaker 11]
I'll, I'll, I'll use a, I'll use two of my, actually, I'll use three of my scholar dice.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
There you go. 24 intelligence, uh, investigation check.

[Speaker 1]
You're hanging out looking for like interesting people. And you notice a few of them have been, a small group of them have been looking over at you guys consistently and kind of pointing their glasses over. And they're doing it in a weird way where it kind of looks like they're making all these hands.

[Speaker 7]
I am going to relay this to Garrett. He's using telepathic speech. Hey, watch out.

Yeah. Bunch of people keep looking over at us, keep making hand signals.

[Speaker 2]
Did you say that to Karis or to everyone?

[Speaker 11]
I'll use telepathic speech to inform you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm definitely gonna relay that to Mimosa because she's the one that is, has a target on her back.

[Speaker 6]
Am I the only one that has a target or do, do multiple people have?

[Speaker 2]
I probably do, but not from them.

[Speaker 4]
Do you understand it with your thieves count?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, do I?

[Speaker 2]
I'm not looking back.

[Speaker 1]
They're just pointing, they're just pointing you guys out at the moment.

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Just.

[Speaker 2]
Before they kill us, I do have a question to ask her.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. And you wanted to ask a question yourself.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, do you know anything about the cult of the Eyeless? And I think that's what they're called. The Eyeless cult.

[Speaker 1]
Quite a bit, actually. I was going to have you go attack them. For the sake of this dream of the Blue Veil, you know, going into the Silvergroth's mine plan.

Assuming that you were amenable to it.

[Speaker 2]
But can you tell me about them in general?

[Speaker 1]
Well, they worship a false god. It's a front so that nobles feed pockets into the, nobles just feed coins into the, into the pockets of insane cultists. Money laundering.

No, no, it's if only.

[Speaker 2]
So the cult's using rich people?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. They give them certain benefits, cure them of certain ailments, usually by way of psionic domination or brainwashing. And just, you know, small adjustments to the personality that help them, you know, go about their lives without so much pain or suffering or inconvenience.

And all the while, claim that it's miracles on the part of their deity.

[Speaker 2]
Are there any local nobles feeding money to this cult?

[Speaker 1]
Inside of Sharos, I believe that the last representatives they sent up here were skewered by the, well, by the Knife of Esheraus and his men.

[Speaker 2]
Surely they work in the shadows.

[Speaker 1]
They, not quite. The cult does maintain an air of exclusivity, but it's really just to draw in more people with money. Because those are the sorts of people who are going to try to force, they're going to try to bribe their way into any kind of clergy or church.

[Speaker 2]
Well, who's their biggest provider?

[Speaker 1]
Their biggest provider.

[Speaker 2]
Who provides them with the most coin?

[Speaker 1]
Most coin. It was a Lord Kenneth and a Lady Evelyn in Bronloch not so long ago, but they've been recently disposed of. So I believe, well, Lord Kenneth is still alive.

It's just he lost a significant portion of his treasury in recovering, recovering himself in his station. But I believe at the moment, I believe at the moment, it's actually, oh, well, that's wrong as well. For a while, there was Professor Sebastian of Brodlock Thule.

Where is it now?

[Speaker 8]
I'm not taking a sip of this.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I know where it is. There's a gentleman named Shoal who owns Shoal's mine, or used to own Shoal's mine. At the moment, it's been somewhat abandoned.

There's still fortifications and a minor guard posted there, but there are no workers on account of the frost. And I hear that he's retreated further south, split up most of his holdings, taken most of his investments, and moved them to Bronloch. He's presently their biggest financial backer.

[Speaker 2]
Good to know. One more thing, one tiny thing. Does Pycus have many dealings here still?

[Speaker 1]
He certainly has enough. I'm sure that you were looking for more than just information on a cult. There are smugglers in the area.

I believe that he used a recent influx of Darklings to bring in some of his Glacier 4 blades. He's trying to get backing from Rupert Shades nearby, trying to get him to part from some of his holdings.

[Speaker 2]
Something about the Darklings.

[Speaker 8]
I'm sorry, what?

[Speaker 2]
You said something? I need you to repeat the last thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so he sent in some Glacier 4 blades through the Darklings that recently came in, about a pallet of them. And he's been trying to get Rupert Shades to open up some smuggling routes, just to bring in additional Fae from within the river that aren't really associated with Pycus, that aren't associated or sworn to the Hyborial Court, so they can actually, you know, so they can travel outside of the Frost. It's kind of Pycus's biggest problem right now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Was there anything else you wish to know? Anything else I could assist you with?

[Speaker 2]
I think I'm good. I think I'm okay. We have people watching us at the moment.

[Speaker 8]
Well, that's the best time to ask.

[Speaker 2]
Can I get back to you?

[Speaker 8]
Certainly, certainly.

[Speaker 4]
I wonder how's the good questions?

[Speaker 8]
Well, who knows? How to, I don't know.

[Speaker 7]
All right, I think it's my turn. I am searching for a Shard of the Far Realm. I need to...

I was seeking out a way to further attune to psionic energy, such as that, so... Why don't I ask for a physical shard of it?

[Speaker 1]
All right, so for this you have two options, I suppose. Would you prefer to take from the Nightmare of the Far Realms under the cover of night, or would you prefer to confront it? Or would you prefer to immerse yourself in it?

If any of the three of these could give you the shard. Let's say that immersing yourself within the Far Realms, within the Nightmare, would give you an even greater chance of success, and carry additional boons beyond the shard itself. And confronting it would give you instead the greatest chance of death, but perhaps the chance to learn something more about yourself in the process.

And stealing it from under the cover of night would just hobble the Nightmare that much further, but without you having learned much of anything at all. Would you say that immersing myself would assist in the battle against the Shiver Breath? I wouldn't say any such thing at all.

A shame. The question is whether... The question is about how you react, and how you think that you would react, and what your preferences are.

But I do believe I would say to immerse myself in it.

[Speaker 7]
Didn't exactly get these strengths of mine by pure brute strength.

[Speaker 1]
It's a level. Very well. There's a sacrificial pool at the bottom of Celial's Spire.

You can immerse yourself there. Very well. Thank you for the information.

And do we have anybody else?

[Speaker 2]
Um, I thought of a question. Um, where are the Darklings keeping these... Bl...

what are they called?

[Speaker 1]
Glacier-4 Blades. Unfortunately, I don't know that. I'm not really a...

I'm a sage, but I'm not... You know. I'm not omniscient.

[Speaker 8]
I deal in dreams' importance, and I read people's emotions.

[Speaker 3]
We do know where some Darklings are.

[Speaker 9]
We do.

[Speaker 8]
I suspect the Blades themselves aren't quite far. But, uh... Anyway, that's what I had to do.

[Speaker 1]
It's about this time that a... It's about this time that a druid who has a lot of spores kind of like on his clothes, just kind of falling off his clothes, walks in, and he's coughing a lot.

[Speaker 6]
Oh! Oh, do we recognize that?

[Speaker 1]
Some of you would recognize it. I believe Para would recognize Deltami.

[Speaker 3]
I am.

[Speaker 1]
Except he looks a little bit off. Like, his face is all misshapen. And, uh, there are pieces of his body that are, like, swelling and deflating at random.

And every time it deflates, there's a bit of spores flying out.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh! Are you okay?

Oh gosh, I'm hiding. I'm stealthing. I'm hiding.

[Speaker 4]
I'm...

[Speaker 1]
Was that everybody's questions, by the way? Was that all of you?

[Speaker 6]
Um, I just want to... Is Mamosa the only one in the group marked on her hand?

[Speaker 1]
No, that's not what I asked. No, you're the only one that has, like, literal ink on your hand, yes.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well, I'm going to try and, um, not be where the current Walking Plague is. So, uh...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm in the wrappers. Fuck that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. One mushroom encounter was enough. I...

no, that is not a way.

[Speaker 7]
You'll have to tell me about this mushroom encounter.

[Speaker 3]
I should help the poor man. Yeah, Perra's gonna go try and help. Um...

Mamosa will, too.

[Speaker 7]
Well, it can't be as bad as Aboleth's. Incoming roll call.

[Speaker 2]
You must turn the fire. I'll back you if anything happens.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure, all of you will lay a constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
Nope. All of us? I'm staying.

[Speaker 1]
Far away. Everybody who's, like, going next to the thing... If you're going next to him, like, go put it over this way.

[Speaker 7]
I'm committing three d8s. I'm fine.

[Speaker 1]
If you are helping him move your character over this way...

[Speaker 7]
All right, 24. Um...

[Speaker 8]
Don't hurt Corpus.

[Speaker 9]
Not again!

[Speaker 8]
I got a crit. Oh, look, he's dead.

[Speaker 3]
Not again. And I can't help you because I had to help myself. I'm sorry, Mamosa.

Again?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, uh, Mamosa...

[Speaker 6]
Yes, it would appear again.

[Speaker 4]
Ay caramba.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I did an ability check. Oh, well, it's the same. I did the same.

[Speaker 1]
So Mamosa takes a whopping handful of these spores as the Deltanu Silulacrum explodes. Uh, and she falls unconscious. Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 6]
All right, goodbye, guys.

[Speaker 1]
Just, you know, just to sleep, basically.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
There's nothing really important there. But the point of real importance was... Let's see here.

Who am I getting used for this? Yeah, oh, I can just roll a d20 and start adding things.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna fly down and like, I'm gonna cover my...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, nobody else is doing anything right now.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I feel like it's a very good thing that I crit on that Constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it doesn't really matter because nobody... Because you guys aren't Mamosa. Who?

Yeah. You guys see a tendril of nearly invisible energy. It's just like, it's not Hawking's radiation.

It's the kind that, uh, it's the kind of light-based radiation that pops out whenever something hot is struck. And I can't remember the name of it. Like the heat haze?

What? Like a heat haze sort of thing? Maybe, but I can't remember the name of the type of radiation.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Will you shut up?

[Speaker 9]
Oh!

[Speaker 7]
Attack!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so, uh, Mamosa gets yanked out there. And then I need to do one of these.

[Speaker 8]
Yes, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So you see this tendril of nearly invisible energy only really appearing every time a little bit of a, of a crackle or a, uh, any time the tendril kinks or curves, uh, you see a little flash of light that like kind of illuminates its outline. And it snakes around Mamosa's leg and yanks her immediately 50 feet out the door.

[Speaker 2]
Christ. Oh no, she's been kidnapped.

[Speaker 7]
I'm gonna pull her back in.

[Speaker 6]
You guys are- I'm always getting yanked around, what the hell?

[Speaker 7]
I am pulling you back in.

[Speaker 4]
You're too nice for your own good.

[Speaker 6]
I know.

[Speaker 3]
Well, she's out 50 feet, so I don't think your telekinetic will help. No.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see.

[Speaker 7]
True. So, yeah, I would have to run.

[Speaker 4]
50 feet, 50- Oh, here we go!

[Speaker 7]
I would have to go 20 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Dispel magic, what about that? What? No, so she is already out.

You can, you can describe what you're attempting to do to, to follow, but she is currently out of sight, um, and out of reach. Further south of the, uh, let's see, further south of this art gallery is a, uh, let's see, there's a range of pubs. And, and dockside restaurants.

A very small inlet into the canal. A low-paid creature. Oh, this is fun.

Uh, Pera, you do not- Okay, um, Pera, you do not sense, um, you do not sense Mimosa anywhere nearby.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that means she went immediately into water.

[Speaker 5]
What, what's the range on that, approximately?

[Speaker 3]
A thousand feet.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
But if she goes into rushing water, it blocks it, so.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, froze.

[Speaker 3]
Um, so Pera's going to run towards the water.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, could, does the sage know anything about the water?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the sage is, yep, she's out. Uh, Lady Violet is here.

[Speaker 2]
Lady Violet, where did the mage go? The sage.

[Speaker 1]
But back to safety, as I wish to do.

[Speaker 2]
Hold on, the water, is there an, something in the water? A place, anything?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know, but let me tell you the, uh, the, these glass knives, the knife of Vasheros, they're quite good at disguising themselves from divination. So I don't know if, let's see here, I have one. Give me one second to look up a rules interaction.

Don't people have Herbalist Ice? Yes, but both of the people there use their Herbalist Ice on themselves. True.

And also, that happened like 10 minutes ago, so it's not changing. I, I know, I just like, blearily like, yeah. Okay, so Pera's rushing towards the water.

Does anybody have anything particularly effective at seeking out their companions? Or seeking out anything at all? I'll let you guys discuss it amongst yourselves, no time pressure.

While I go find my chicken pot pie. Phineas, help them out.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, let's see, um, the best I got right now, I think, is Polymorph. Um, could try to Polymorph into something that, like, has a scent, to try to follow her scent. But if she went into water, I think it would be difficult to, to do both.

Um, have Find Familiar, so I might be able to conjure a Familiar. I don't think any of the Familiars have, like, Bloodhound status, so.

[Speaker 4]
Must, though.

[Speaker 5]
Anyone else? Divination?

[Speaker 3]
Well, he's just said they're good against Divination, so Divination's gonna be kinda useless here.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, but I have Sending, so I can send in, I can send in, She's unconscious.

[Speaker 2]
You could Polymorph into something, um, aquatic, and, and around in the water, see if there's an opening anywhere. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I could get a swim speed, but I don't think I could, like, figure out where they went.

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone have any mundane tracking ability?

[Speaker 5]
Not on this character.

[Speaker 7]
Um, no, but if I spot them, I can move really fast. I mean, I can get a fly speed for, like, a minute, and I could also use summon apparition to call up something that can fly for, like, an hour, but, hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, but what use is flying to us? We have to find her first.

[Speaker 7]
That's why I'm not really counting that as much of an option.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. Can sharks smell good?

[Speaker 5]
Well, good question. I also have a Staff of Command that lets me cast, uh, speak with plants. So I might be able to use that to ask the plants where she went.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Are those people at the, that were, like, looking at her still at the bar? Or in the area?

Nope. Of course. Okay, so they said something about, um, jumping into a pool at an exact area at an exact place.

Um, something about jumping into a pool of water at an exact area and coming through the other side. Wasn't that something about in, like, the sewers or something?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's very far beneath the earth. That's nowhere near this place.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We're very far beneath the sharrows. But yeah, so, you have plants. You guys can either search the restaurant, you could search the docks, or you can search, I guess, under the docks, which is the water.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I...

[Speaker 1]
I'll let each of you decide which. Um... But those of you who are doing something else, I'll let you guys decide that, but some of you guys are doing things besides just searching.

So Phineas, you said you wanted to cast Speak with Plants?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. Yeah, there's plenty of plants on the dock here.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, let's see. How many charges does it... Takes three charges.

[Speaker 1]
I'll even give you three charges. Um, there's a row of ferns next to the, uh, next to the, the close, the nearest restaurant. There's a bunch of kelp and seaweed that has kind of uh, been half dragged onto the, onto the docks themselves.

And then there's a, well, you know, one of the closest boats is a bunch of, uh, a bunch of conifers, like potted, potted conifers that are getting transported.

[Speaker 5]
Um, uh, so it goes to within a 30-foot radius of me. So could I, if I go out onto the docks, could I get the conifers and the kelp?

[Speaker 1]
You sure could.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah, I'll cast it there then.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
They're alive.

[Speaker 5]
Right. Um, uh, do I put this? I guess I'll put it here.

Um, uh, I'll ask if they saw a, um, a person of my companion's description being, uh, carried away.

[Speaker 1]
They sure, they sure did. Uh, the conifers saw, uh, conifers saw someone load mimosa, an unconscious mimosa next, yeah, there we go. The conifer saw someone launch an, an unconscious mimosa into the boat next to them.

And the kelp says that there's a large, a very large watery creature, watery creature, Jesus. Yeah, basically there's a large scaled and, uh, basically there's a fucking plesiosaur underneath the water that's tied to this small boat.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
So she got, she got loaded onto a boat that is now gone. Is that right?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's right next to that.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, on that boat. Uh, yeah, I'll cast message and alert the party. Let's get on this boat.

Onwards.

[Speaker 4]
Get on the boat.

[Speaker 8]
Give me a second.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, who's the first person? The person with telekinetic, can, can you try yanking them once we got close enough?

[Speaker 7]
Sure.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Maybe I can also push people off the boat as well.

[Speaker 5]
Just like hold them underwater and drown them. That's pretty baller.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, all righty. Okay. I got one last thing to roll here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, it's, it's your guys' turn. You guys see a soft glow coming from the boat itself.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, Para's gonna just try and get on the boat. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Maybe my guy can fly.

[Speaker 1]
All right, then what are you guys doing?

[Speaker 10]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
I'll describe the boat a little bit. It's a bit like a, like a fishing boat that has a, a little bit of an interior room. Uh, it's large enough that it can, that the interior probably stretches underneath the top deck, like the, the entirety of the top deck.

More of a luxury boat than any. It is equipped with a sail that has a very minor arcane engine attached to the back of it.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, so if I'm picturing in this head, in my head correctly, it's like, uh, it's like one of those boats that you see in like 90% of YouTube videos. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Think of modern fishing boat.

[Speaker 7]
Yep. Picturing it correctly. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No, you got it exactly.

[Speaker 7]
So I'm going, Corpus is going to run to the, the door, like the, it's probably a door on this thing from what you've described. And he's going to open the door. He's going to open the door.

[Speaker 1]
So one person is going to do something through this check that's going to throw off whether these guys, it's either going to significantly hinder how these guys succeed or fail or going to change the rest of the outcome. So I need somebody to like say that they're doing something or pursuing something specific.

[Speaker 7]
Lucent will go ahead and cast magic missile to blow up the engine.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Lucien's going to poke around the ship to look for hidden compartments or search below decks, that kind of thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
To look.

[Speaker 1]
There's a below deck. Yep. I think you guys are, something is about to happen where these guys are about to, oh, let me put this way.

These guys are about to escape and whether they do that, do it with complications or do, or don't succeed at all.

[Speaker 2]
Can I see the people driving the boat?

[Speaker 1]
There are no people on the top deck.

[Speaker 2]
Um, okay. Can I go into like the pilot area? I don't know if that's called on a boat.

Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Weather in bloom, nothing, nothing, nothing.

[Speaker 2]
If so, I'm gonna cast hypnotic pattern. Can I get to them?

[Speaker 1]
You can, if you're like, if you and like Corpus are barging in there, you want to like cast hypnotic pattern that will actually do something.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well, I'm doing that. Third level.

[Speaker 7]
And I'll be barging in using stunning strike on thing that looks bad.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to have web prepared.

[Speaker 1]
We are going to resolve. Kairos was the first one to mention something of consequence.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I tried to cast it, but I, it's, uh.

[Speaker 1]
Concentration.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. How do I toggle that off?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, when you, when you select the spell, they'll give you the options of like, do you want to do concentration? Do you want to place a template, spend a spell slot, stuff like that. And you can uncheck, uh, expend a spell slot.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. All right. Oops.

I placed a, no, I didn't place the template. Did I place the template? I did.

[Speaker 8]
Plus eight.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's still bad for them. Okay. Would somebody please roll me?

Is it D10 or is it a D8?

[Speaker 4]
So, D10, D8.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, D10, please.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Sorry. Oh, Corpus has rolled it already.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, reroll.

[Speaker 2]
Cheater.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, it's because it wouldn't affect this thing. I thought you said 11 and I was going to hunt you down.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, I actually rolled a D12.

[Speaker 2]
A D10 plus one.

[Speaker 1]
If they complete their goal. Okay. No, I think this is, this is actually quite perfect.

Uh, given what Corpus and Rez said that they were going to do. So, you guys find a, um, you guys find three of these assassins underneath the, uh, under the deck in the middle of casting this, uh, of using a psionic, creating a small psionic gate. It goes to a different plane of existence, the little upside down world they, they call home.

The, based on where they've angled it, the boat is immediately starting to get rushed in. Uh, or sorry, the, the boat, yeah, basically water immediately starts falling in, like kind of something into this gate and the boat is obviously falling soon. Uh, you guys hit, uh, you, you guys hit, sorry.

Uh, let's see here. Silk is going to, is going to cast, sorry, no, Lirian is casting web on these guys. A Corpus is using stunning strike, which interrupts the process.

So only part of the boat makes it through. Which is the part with Mimosa on it. Fuck.

You have two of the assailants in your custody. And, uh, an arm. From the third.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we're going to use the arm to do it.

[Speaker 7]
Wait. Does the gate have holes in it? Like, yeah, is it like?

[Speaker 1]
No, they, they, small portal to, to another realm, started, boat starts going through it. Uh, the boat, the, the portal closes cause the guys, they're interrupted. Yeah, sorry, my, my head, just like, I hurt, my head, like, hurt.

No, you're good. Yeah. Yeah, like a literal, physical gate.

[Speaker 5]
Like a wrought iron gate.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So Mimosa has, uh, Mimosa is unconscious on the other side with an assassin. Oh boy.

[Speaker 2]
Um, how far away are we?

[Speaker 4]
Minus one arm?

[Speaker 1]
Minus one arm. And you guys are on a boat upon which the front has fallen off.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. How far away are we to, like, land?

[Speaker 1]
We're right next to it.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, okay. Can I do a gate myself? Oh, do I have a diamond worth 5,000?

I do not.

[Speaker 2]
The people that we have, are they unconscious?

[Speaker 1]
No, they're stunned at the moment. They're being, they're successfully captured. That was their complication, was if they completed their goal, they would be captured.

[Speaker 2]
Can we find a very secluded place to extract information out of these people?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. You can get off the boat first.

[Speaker 2]
Right by the land, we'll get there.

[Speaker 1]
That could help with that. I think I have to take thoughts. Is anyone good at looting things quickly?

[Speaker 4]
What do you mean by that? To grab the stuff off the boat?

[Speaker 1]
You guys think of it while I drag Mimosa into another channel briefly.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like Charis would be good at looting stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 7]
Also, Lucien will be grabbing things with the telekinetic field. Clawing everything towards him. Same.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. Okay, Nessie, I'm going to drag you into another channel. Okie dokie.

The rest of you, the noble that you rescued earlier is kind of, is walking with a cane along the street, calling out for the people who rescued him earlier. And that is what I leave you with for the moment. Okay, so.

[Speaker 6]
I'm here. I'm just muting.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, you're fine. I actually don't know what to. So right now you're in the little upside down world.

You're affected by something that's going to keep you unconscious for probably an hour here.

[Speaker 8]
And there we go.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to keep you unconscious for about an hour here. And yeah, does she have stuff for like getting out of this or?

[Speaker 6]
Um, she could probably get out of restraint and stuff, but not to become conscious again.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Okay. Because what I'm thinking is.

This is probably a place where like she will be in need of rescue. But not like in prison, if that makes sense.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Like she will probably get out this thing. This guy has like one arm left. Okay.

So he's in a bad way. And he's got a. And Mimosa is no slouch.

But basically, she'll have the opportunity to, I guess, do things through any through the course of any rescue mission. Would be able to. Yeah, through the course of any rescue mission, she would be making checks and rolls to see if she could basically reconnect with the party.

But also she's really what she's doing. She's fleeing throughout the area. So that what the party is trying to do is catch up to her.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Because she has to outpace and outmaneuver the. The people that if she gets caught up to if they catch up to her, then obviously that's not great for her. And and she'll be sort of at their mercy, not completely at the mercy, but sort of at their mercy.

But that's also an opportunity for the party to catch up, if that makes sense.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Is she going to be stripped of her stuff or does she get all her equipment with her?

[Speaker 1]
Well, the problem is, I'm sure the guy would like love to do that, like to try to get the equipment off. But he only has one arm right now. Okay, cool.

And doesn't have a boat.

[Speaker 6]
Got it. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So he's he's in a bad way. So I think basically Mimosa would get like tied up for a little while and and maybe drive to shore. But then this guy's probably going to be toast.

And as long as Mimosa can get out, then it would be that kind of chase that we did next session. So if whenever we rescue her.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, her sleight of hand is plus 15 and she can't roll under a 10.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, she's not, he's not gonna, he can't. Right?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He's just fucked out the situation.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that was fun. I rolled that one on the D100 for, well, during the daytime for the AD&D city encounters, he is an assassin. During the nighttime, it's a result of one through three.

And, uh, and yeah, so I rolled up the assassin. I was like, well, are they killing or the kidnapping? I said, they're probably kidnapping.

[Speaker 6]
Awesome. I'm a little bit excited that she got kidnapped.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, no, I'm glad because I didn't talk with you about this beforehand, because I think it probably would have spoiled it. But also I was nervous that it was.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I can play like I don't know really well. But yeah, it's all good. Yeah, I was just messaging Otter.

I was like, I kind of want her to get kidnapped. That way I can join the damsel in distress club.

[Speaker 8]
The damsel in distress club. All right, that's, that's awesome. All right, time to go back.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Well, good. Did I get everything?

Is that good plan of? Yeah. Oh, hello.

[Speaker 1]
Hello.

[Speaker 4]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so we were just discussing the damsel in distress situation. But yeah, so there's a, uh, there's a esteemed gentleman next to you folks. It was very esteemed noble.

Very grateful for no longer being trained by luck vampires or regular vampires. Could have gone either way on becoming a vampire. But, uh, you know, being at the mercy wasn't a cool thing.

So he is happy about that. And he was here to offer some rewards and or some favors.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds great.

[Speaker 1]
I believe that the party was, uh, finding a secluded area. Which really exists right next to you guys, right? The boat next to you is uninhabited and just has a ton of plants on it.

So good for muting, uh, muting loud conversations and, uh, secretly uninhabited. And last question I asked was, is anybody, could anybody make some, like, sleight of hand checks for getting loot out of the boat? Because there is loot here.

[Speaker 7]
I can do that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, must have be sleight of hand. Shame. I would.

Uh, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
It must be sleight of hand. This is not like the skill dogpile opportunity. Are there like two people who want to do this?

[Speaker 2]
Red hand. I'll do that. And then we get to carving up these assassins to get information out of them.

[Speaker 8]
I see.

[Speaker 4]
And possibly talking to the noble because he could probably get, you know, with the whole golden favors thing, we can probably get a gate, at least one gate thing out of it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we, we, we said we're, uh, Lirion was gonna do that, didn't we?

[Speaker 4]
Yes. So Lirion, get to chatting.

[Speaker 2]
Can we search the assassins to make sure they don't have anything that they could, like, off themselves with? Um, has they been captured?

[Speaker 1]
Give me a list of three places to start off with.

[Speaker 2]
Um, the sleeve. Um.

[Speaker 4]
His mouth. That's a classic.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, his teeth. And his pockets.

[Speaker 1]
Pockets. All right, they did have something in their mouth.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna take it. I don't care if it's a tooth, I'll rip it out.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, okay.

[Speaker 2]
These people are not dying.

[Speaker 3]
Paris is now upgraded to Tooth Fairy.

[Speaker 4]
Ha ha. Hell yeah. That's great.

Isn't that beautiful? The next step, by the way, is Bone Fairy. Take that as you will.

[Speaker 8]
Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so these guys are, uh, they're trying to get off themselves, and you guys intervene. Lirion is discussing the situation with Nopal. He immediately accepts.

He's like, yes, yes, I could definitely, anything for the people will save my life. Let's see here. And then you guys would have recovered some root off the boat itself.

All right. I'm going to stop talking. I'm going to type my answers in chat.

And before, you know, as we wrap up here, I'll probably, I'll probably put my, yeah, I'm going to put my answers inside the, uh, the Discord chat as well.

[Speaker 5]
Inside the City Crawl? Party, how are we, uh, is there, are there any hard-to-get items that we know we need? I think we had mentioned, like, winter boots.

This might be a good opportunity to try to get those, if this guy's connected.

[Speaker 4]
We can probably just take the whole smattering of gold in the favor of rescuing.

[Speaker 3]
I think this is us asking specifically for, oh, what are we asking of the assassins?

[Speaker 5]
Of the assassins.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, okay. Item number one for the assassins. Can you, do you have the materials to cast, uh, the Gate spell again?

Connect with the Staff of Power. That sounds good.

[Speaker 7]
Yep, I can combo that with Detect Thoughts if, uh, you know, that fills. Because either way, they're still going to be thinking about it.

[Speaker 5]
Are you saying that you do? Are you doing that? Or are you just saying that you can if you want to?

Hmm.

[Speaker 7]
I'll do it.

[Speaker 2]
Can, who's, who can cast Detect Thoughts while we're getting information out of these assassins?

[Speaker 7]
Me. And, uh, I will, uh, use my chance to dig deep. So.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Why the hell am I- Not a spell, and we're cut off.

[Speaker 9]
What?

[Speaker 5]
Ha ha! Vindication!

[Speaker 7]
How the hell am I remembering Destroy All Humans? Why am I, why am I remembering that game all of a sudden?

[Speaker 5]
Um. You're cut off, what does that mean? How do we, how do we get, how do we get to the, the, your upside down little fucked up demiplane?

Do we know who hired these guys? Teammates?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, she said she had a, a brush with them not too long ago.

[Speaker 5]
This might be the time to, to find out. Someone else, someone else ask the next, next questions. I asked two questions.

I passed the, the talking stick.

[Speaker 3]
Couldn't answer my other two questions, but.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, during all of this, uh, Lucent will just be burrowing into their mind with Detect Thoughts. Which will need a wisdom save from them.

[Speaker 2]
Probably at, at disadvantage, because, um, they're also being, their ankles are being bitten and, um, their fingers are being threatened.

[Speaker 7]
A lot of things for them to keep track of.

[Speaker 2]
Um, and if that doesn't suffice, I will start taking fingers.

[Speaker 5]
What we really mean is to, like, turn them into a shark or something that can't breathe, or that has to breathe underwater.

[Speaker 4]
I can't do that.

[Speaker 5]
Just like them down on land.

[Speaker 4]
I wouldn't make them a shark, though. I could turn them into, how do you say, a horse? What's it?

Not, uh, fish horse. I've gotten the word wrong. Seahorse, thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Why a seahorse?

[Speaker 4]
A mirror? Because they are very small. Who has a mirror?

Who took the fucking mirror? Oh, I have the mirror of life, Traffic. We can put them in there too.

Where'd you get it? Hmm?

[Speaker 3]
That was the cabin in the cloud forest.

[Speaker 5]
Name your ransom and you might just see your friend again, so.

[Speaker 4]
I could put them in there.

[Speaker 3]
Name your ransom. What, what does?

[Speaker 2]
The one of, I have a random mirror. I don't know if the mirror is from there, but I do have a mirror.

[Speaker 7]
Um, what was it? Uh, I'm pretty sure, like, uh, you or someone else figured out. Oh yeah, that probably came from the background, right?

[Speaker 4]
No, I don't know about the mirrors from the cabin. This one was from the, uh, discovered items pile, so. Ah, I see.

[Speaker 5]
So we can keep them long and give them an offer. We can say that you're the ransom. These guys?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we give them these guys and we get our friend back.

[Speaker 5]
You think these guys are that valuable?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, probably not. I mean, they could be. Let's ask.

Twitch, I will ask if, um, the lives of their, um, these two assassins are worthless. Oh, I cut off a finger.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, wow. Wow. I can't believe we got answers yet.

You could just, like, cough them over the head or something.

[Speaker 5]
We're going to head to electro pretty quick here.

[Speaker 2]
Um, all right.

[Speaker 4]
So, do they, so they can't get open the gate ever, uh, right now, because they've been cut off since it's not a spell or whatever. Uh, we can give them money or something to get Mimosa back, or we can try to... We could, we could ask the, uh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Why don't we have them? Give us an offer of money, like not an offer, but give, give us a price. Yeah, sure.

[Speaker 5]
Well, they mentioned the mirror, so we know they want the mirror.

[Speaker 4]
50k gold. Jesus Christ. I don't think we have that even together.

[Speaker 5]
That's going to be a no for me, dog.

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
So we like just man a rescue mission. How do we get around this stupid cutoff bullshit? How do we get there?

[Speaker 4]
Gate.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but they can't do the gate. They said they're cut off.

[Speaker 4]
But Pera can, if she gets a good old... Yeah, which we can probably get if we ask the noble, because he's going to give us a bunch of stuff and money. So, like...

[Speaker 5]
What I'm thinking is instead of consuming a bunch of resources, we consume the charges on my staff and just force them to cast it tomorrow or something.

[Speaker 3]
But if they can't... Yeah, tomorrow will be a little late for Mimosa.

[Speaker 5]
Are we doing the ransom, like, tonight? I think that's going to happen. Can these guys even contact the other people?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I mean, the ransom's not set yet. I can still... We can still cut it down from 50.

[Speaker 5]
I don't want to pay a ransom. I'm going to teach these people not to fuck with us.

[Speaker 2]
I suppose an owed favor wouldn't get her back.

[Speaker 5]
Negotiating, like, the same thing every time. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Pera has 200 platinum, but she has to see Mimosa first.

[Speaker 2]
Do we know the plane that they were taken to? I don't know if I heard that.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, interesting.

[Speaker 7]
It's not it saves. It checks specifically.

[Speaker 3]
No, he's telling you to make them.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
21 and 16.

[Speaker 5]
It's going to be like scanners. It's your head going to explode.

[Speaker 2]
Don't give him ideas.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry.

[Speaker 7]
Man, if it's psychic damage, I have resistance.

[Speaker 2]
Um, what do you need for the, um, the gate spell? Because we can just break in somewhere and get it with the supplies.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, gate requires a diamond worth at least 5,000. Which Pera can afford if she can find a diamond worth 5,000.

[Speaker 5]
Can we target it though? Like, do we, do you have to...

[Speaker 3]
We need to know where this plane is.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Like what do you need in order to be able to gate?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, for gate, I literally just say, uh, I'd like Mimosa Marigold, please. And then it just opens to Mimosa Marigold. She's on another plane.

So yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well, let's go find that. Um, I think that's the best.

[Speaker 4]
So we can probably ask the noble if you know, the guy who owes us several favors. Yeah. So he's going, he said, he's going to give us all this stuff.

We can also be like, and also this one gem. So we can just grab our...

[Speaker 3]
Pera would help pay for it if necessary. She just needs the access to it.

[Speaker 5]
And is that like, how, how long does it stay open?

[Speaker 3]
Um, things per person.

[Speaker 2]
So it's a one way thing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Uh, here, I'm just going to post it to chat. I'm just not going to consume anything.

That way you guys can actually read it. Um. The fuck was that?

I think it just pulls them through the gate.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, it does.

[Speaker 3]
You can put into a precise location on a different plane of existence that you can walk through.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. It's concentration will last for one minute. So you could immediately close the portal.

So you don't have to worry about other people coming through.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think that's what we should do then.

[Speaker 7]
Or something.

[Speaker 2]
These, uh, these assassins are useless.

[Speaker 7]
So, uh, want me to feed them to Hadar?

[Speaker 2]
Okay with that. But we should probably keep them until we have Mimosa.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Just knock them unconscious and tie them up.

[Speaker 2]
And go get those handcuffs off the table from that place.

[Speaker 3]
Pera's not smart. She's just mad.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, same with Charis.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we've dealt with Mimosa's thing relatively, right?

[Speaker 5]
Are these, are these guys psychic?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yeah. They seemingly tried to do a backlash thing against me.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So like keeping them alive might mean that they warn this guy about the spell that we're going to try to cast. So it might be better to just kill them now.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Yep. I wonder if the the pain also flow over there. This hypothetical psychic link there.

Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Miriam votes to execute them.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, Lucien also votes to execute them. Corpus also votes to execute them.

[Speaker 3]
Pera doesn't care.

[Speaker 4]
I'll look away.

[Speaker 2]
No time to killing them now.

[Speaker 4]
I'll pull a Switzerland and just not. All right.

[Speaker 2]
We'll give them one last chance to help us. And then we're killing them.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think they can do anything to help us, which sucks for them. But oh well.

[Speaker 7]
Honestly. The fact they were sent out with presumably a way to quickly kill themselves indicates that they're probably expandable to their organization anyway. They're probably not very high up.

[Speaker 2]
We're saying this all of this in front of them.

[Speaker 7]
But yeah, they logically can't be bad.

[Speaker 5]
What we might want to do is kill one and then tell the other one that we're going to execute them unless he permits you to mind read him his deep thoughts.

[Speaker 2]
They were all in agreement killing them.

[Speaker 4]
They had self-sacrificial like what's it cyanide teeth? I don't think. Yeah, so sure.

Though this isn't in character.

[Speaker 5]
Threatening them with death. Probably to threaten them with pain or something instead. Not really in a torturing mood.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Oh no. Let's take him there.

[Speaker 4]
A gate above the morgue does not bode well for our murder victim.

[Speaker 2]
We're gonna find two extra bodies in the morgue in the morning.

[Speaker 4]
Ominous.

[Speaker 5]
Is there the gate? Maybe we just go through that instead of casting the gate spell. I don't know.

The gate spell is pretty nice because it just yanks her over to us.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, rather than us going to her and we won't get stuck anywhere.

[Speaker 5]
We don't have to get back. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Okay. So, um, all right.

So we've sorted how we're going to get Mimosa. What? Oh, oh, oh, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Can we kill them? That's the sacrifice? I believe so.

Yes. One good thrust in the head. In the eye or something.

Takes him right out.

[Speaker 4]
I think he hunger payedarded them.

[Speaker 3]
I think it is getting a little too late for big decisions.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I'm really tired.

[Speaker 4]
So, I wonder how that feels.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know if it feels fucking right. Okay, so we kill the two assassins. We ask for gold and a $5,000 diamond.

Does it have to be a diamond or is it any gem? Diamond. It does have to be a diamond, specifically.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, he was offering items upward of $25k, so it's going to be a lot of gold.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, do we want items instead? Because there are low availability items. We should make a decision quickly.

[Speaker 2]
I just want gold, but, um... Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 5]
Pure gold, that's fine. Are we going to need the Boots of Winter to, like, hike up and kill this Shivergroth or whatever?

[Speaker 4]
What do they do? So, we can always just stack up on the gold and then buy, because, you know, gold's more versatile. We can buy more stuff with it.

[Speaker 5]
But I think buying magic items is really hard, though.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, but we can buy on a case-by-case basis easier, I suppose.

[Speaker 2]
Um, so how are we going to get, since this session's ending, how are we going to get Mimosa out? Okay, we're just using the gate?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
And we're deciding about whether to just get pure gold for everyone or items?

[Speaker 5]
Mixture of items.

[Speaker 4]
I'm in the pure gold side, because...

[Speaker 5]
Easiest to divide, yeah. Yeah, pure gold. I'm okay with that.

[Speaker 4]
I'm okay with pure gold.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's even faster.

Anything at all? Anything your heart desires. I don't have any reason.

I don't have reason for how rich this guy is. Um, I think I have to vary there. Okay.

Oh! Okay.

[Speaker 3]
What would the rarity be on high value diamonds?

[Speaker 7]
They got you very rare.

[Speaker 4]
You could probably get a bunch of diamonds.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was just thinking if you could pass me, like, multiple, or if just one is, like, it. Um. Because some high level heals would be nice to have in the pocket.

[Speaker 4]
A gate portal doesn't consume the diamond, does it?

[Speaker 3]
It does. Most spells that require high level diamond are gonna eat it.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, that's a shame.

[Speaker 3]
Because they a bitch. Um, for 1k, that'll do, though. I get to add some more diamonds.

How do I make a diamond? Why did it get rid of my add button?

[Speaker 4]
I'll take the staff of power he said he was willing to hook, uh, to, quote unquote, hook one up with.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe I'll ask for a plus three rapier. That's, uh, that's a very rare.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna take gold.

[Speaker 7]
A plus three ra- wow. I have no clue what that does, but. Oh, for lyrian, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Would he give magic items?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
He said, uh, yeah, James said in text, think up to very rare. That is up to and including. Ooh.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, instead of getting anything, can you do me a favor? Um. Um, is this guy worth, uh, having a favor owed?

Like, instead of him giving me something, he can just owe a favor? Okay. Where, um, he's a noble.

Where is his standing? Like, is he, uh, how did he- yeah. What's his deal?

How's he useful? Inner city merchant, wonderful. Does his noble have a name?

[Speaker 4]
Guy. Uh, wonderful, wonderful name.

[Speaker 5]
Is it French? So it's like Guy, Guy MacFinn?

[Speaker 4]
I think it might be Irish based on the Mac.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe he's a, he's a Celtic Frenchman.

[Speaker 4]
Celtic Frenchman. I mean, Guy is a name.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. In France, where it's pronounced Guy.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Perhaps then his mother was French. Or the fantasy equivalent.

[Speaker 3]
Guy MacFinn. Uh, the origin is actually Dutch and German.

[Speaker 9]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, not name. This is for actual, like, language Guy. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, the one that means, like, a dude.

[Speaker 3]
I had a teacher named Guy.

[Speaker 4]
Regular man. Like, G-A-Y?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Huh.

[Speaker 4]
How old was he?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, she was really cool and she was older.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, okay. So it was probably still with, like, naming your child Happiness or something.

[Speaker 3]
Interesting. Guy is a boy's name of French origin meaning wood. Hmm.

Hmm. Apparently it's also a Hebrew name. All right, um, French last name meaning morning.

Casually making a new character.

[Speaker 7]
All right, I actually have an answer right now.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so today we're wrapping, we're wrapping up for now. Coolio.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

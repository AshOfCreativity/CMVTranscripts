[Speaker 6]
Voice and video.

[Speaker 7]
Looking for stereo. Are we not? Yes, we are.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I should now be able to hear you.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, hello. Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 7]
I had a delightful time-wasting conversation earlier.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I noticed that. For which I did, of course, get my revenge. And it was sweet revenge.

It was just like, oh, I don't think I'm going to be liked here.

[Speaker 7]
You were so patient with me, and I was just like, man, I think I got to them before they actually left. I'm not sure though.

[Speaker 6]
Did they just decide no one liked them before they even got in? Uh, twice. The second time was probably justified.

I was just kind of like hovering over the button.

[Speaker 4]
Did they like, I don't know, say why they thought no one would like them? Or was it literally just they are an unlikable person? So they assume everyone hates them.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I think probably the latter. But they also said explicitly that they thought, and one of the messages that got deleted, because I just destroyed their entire...

[Speaker 6]
Um, let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
I know I was laughing with Nessie about their not liking combat.

[Speaker 1]
That was something that came up often was, I'm not sure if you like tabletop RPGs. Like, well, no, I had this one that was really good, and like the story was so great, and the story, and the story, and the story. Just so immersed in the story.

And I don't know what magic items I like. I'm like, well, so my recommendation is to just start scrolling. Take it easy.

Ease yourself into it. They're like, well, I don't really like... And they got like, and they're like, you're stressing me out.

And I was like... It was at that moment I decided, um, I was going to stretch it out intentionally.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I was like, I'm going to do mental harm to this person. I'm intentionally, I'm filling the room with bad lives.

[Speaker 6]
To harm this empath in front of me.

[Speaker 7]
Because really, they were just, they were just being so unbelievably antisocial and shitty. Holy shit. I had to take, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see, what was Nessie's exact wordage on this?

[Speaker 6]
Um, a Debbie Downer? Just a little bit. Yeah, she was just like, I fucking hate Debbie Downers.

Because no matter what you do or say, it's always bad or it always will be. You can do no right.

[Speaker 7]
It's just one of these people, first of all, they were one of these people who I'm pretty sure invents fake lives for themselves.

[Speaker 1]
And I know that they go in the same discord. I know they're not all in the same discord, but many of them frequent the same discords. But they invent secret lives for themselves.

They're not, they're not like, um... How do I put this? They're usually actually not LGBT.

But they like invent a persona that's focused around it. And then invent fake lives like how they're... A big one was the maid, the one who had to drive six hours into work every day to work at their maid cafe where they were treated like slaves and not given enough money.

And once everybody started like thinking about this insane proposition, they're like, uh... They usually pitch themselves as being from Japan or from Korea. This one styled themselves as like, oh, I'm in GMT plus nine.

I was like, I... I'm a voice actor. I know when you're not telling the truth about this.

And it's really, really common. It's really, really common in tabletop RPG spaces for the obvious. But they just constantly fill everything with like, uh, here's how sad my fake life is.

You can't take it seriously.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That's, that's so like, um, secondhand embarrassment.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. But we had a couple on the server. One who's like, oh, this is my girlfriend.

It's, um... It's Lily. And the other one is Yoko.

Or no, Yoko is a girlfriend. And the other one is Lily. And I'm like, looking up the times, I'm like, I, I know that this person, no, this person isn't playing a 2AM.

No. No, they have a perfect, they have a perfect English accent or American accent specifically.

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I, I know like kids do that a lot. Like, um, like I've noticed Nora has a little bit of that energy. Like not in an annoying, harmful way.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that Nora is mute either. I'm very, very tempting. Very, very tempting.

Oh man.

[Speaker 4]
Like there was something where like she was, like Nessie had been talking about bad smells and she was like, oh yeah, I made a gas mask out of a rich girl's purse. And it's like, oh, you are one of those kids. And it's like, that is, you would not be allowed, like that would not happen.

And you would not be so proud of it. Like that's just not a thing. Like a purse wouldn't even make a good gas mask.

[Speaker 7]
At all. Like what the fuck are you talking about?

[Speaker 5]
And I read and watched Gone with the Wind as an adolescent.

[Speaker 6]
So I always get weird vibes from them, but they haven't been in a game.

[Speaker 4]
So I haven't really worried about it.

[Speaker 6]
Holy shit though. I'm so fucking, it's just, I was just getting increasingly angry.

[Speaker 4]
I cannot blame you. Oh, we might have to add Nessie. Her husband did the laundry.

So now she has to deal with it.

[Speaker 6]
Of course.

[Speaker 1]
I would never trust a woman with my laundry.

[Speaker 6]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Because I'm so good at doing it.

[Speaker 6]
And that was stupid. I'm going to see if Laura wants to. Actually, I don't know if Laura has a character.

I think you mentioned Meryl.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Meryl could absolutely do this. And I could get them in here. I have excuses.

[Speaker 6]
God nonsense. So right now we have four. We could do five.

[Speaker 7]
I'd be fine with four if she is busy.

[Speaker 1]
We have the two wardens. We have Caber and Devin. Devin?

No, Devette.

[Speaker 2]
Devin. Devin's a good name.

[Speaker 1]
It is a good name. I just don't know if it's, you know.

[Speaker 5]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 2]
No worries.

[Speaker 1]
I'm definitely going to have to start eating before sessions. Or like an hour or two before sessions more often.

[Speaker 7]
I'm still getting hungry to an extent that it gets distracting.

[Speaker 6]
I have never had that issue with shots.

[Speaker 2]
I was cooked when I had my first COVID shot.

[Speaker 4]
I really thought it would be worse than it was. But nah, I was fine.

[Speaker 6]
I had nothing.

[Speaker 7]
I just had COVID. Maybe it was one spirit destroyer, I don't remember.

[Speaker 4]
I have been blessed. I have not gotten it at all.

[Speaker 7]
That is great. You might be one of those special little people who have immunity to it.

[Speaker 6]
I work with a lot of people, so I would hope so. But also, eh. I'm cautious enough, so.

If you have natural immunity to COVID, that sounds funny. Hello Nessie. Nessie!

You didn't give us any XP at last session, did you? I didn't miss that, did I?

[Speaker 7]
No, no. She'll be totaled at the end of this one.

[Speaker 1]
Hence, the dead body pile.

[Speaker 7]
She's very conveniently placed, might I add.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wait, shit. I have to go swap an invocation. When I was leveling up, it didn't ban me from any.

[Speaker 4]
And I accidentally took one. Yeah, I accidentally took a level 15 one. So I just have to go and grab the correct one.

[Speaker 2]
That happened with my, um, artisopher.

[Speaker 4]
It's weird, because everything else, they're really good about being like, oh, this is the level you can take this at, and then just randomly it's like, yeah, invocations?

[Speaker 6]
Fuck yeah. Take them all. Oh yeah, uh, James.

[Speaker 7]
I forgot to ask you this before.

[Speaker 6]
Why are you mumbling far away from your mic?

[Speaker 1]
I'm half deaf. Stop doing that. I don't mean to be mumbling.

I've told you about it.

[Speaker 6]
I don't mean to mumble.

[Speaker 7]
Wait, what did you want? Um. Gotta start the game.

Okay, I'm gonna mute while the game's happening. Can you make, um, a little thingy so I could draw out the map that I am making for the game? Uh, yes.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 7]
Can you give me like a free little area to do it? Great scene.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna pull you over here. Thank you. And put my kid in there.

Got the chain. Thank you. Okay.

Uh, oh, there we go. I'm going to collection. Where's my pizza?

[Speaker 3]
Why don't I have pizza? On my stove!

[Speaker 6]
I think he can hear me. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing?

Get out of there. Is it home? Yes, it was Book of Ancient Secrets.

That's the one I wanted to take.

[Speaker 4]
And I wanted identify. So now I can identify.

[Speaker 6]
And I'm going to take Comprehend Languages. So I can comprehend languages. There we go.

And now I can make all of Hestia's downtime learning spells. You're not allowed to wrangle children. It's game day.

They needed their teeth brushed.

[Speaker 3]
Actually, most of them came to me because they love people and they love me. But I had to wrangle Rosemary. The moment she figured it out, she's like, Nope, I'm going to wiggle and wiggle and wiggle and wiggle.

[Speaker 6]
Which makes sense, her teeth hurt. But I'd be wiggling too. It's in your mouth.

What you got? Give it to me, please. Thank you.

Oh. Oh boy. Yeah, I'm a little sad because the invocation I had to get rid of was Witch Sight.

[Speaker 2]
Which one's Witch Sight?

[Speaker 4]
That's the one that lets you see anything that's camouflaged by illusion or abjuration. So, you know, this guy.

[Speaker 6]
But, again, level 15. Yeah, starting at level 8 sucks.

[Speaker 4]
Like, it's great, but it sucks.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I always assume my Dragon Breath should do more damage.

[Speaker 6]
It's a place called, the majority of it is called, because it is like, nothing but. Well, that's rude. You're not going to shut us out like that.

[Speaker 1]
I have Bluetooth, you know, I can still fucking hear you.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, well, that's rude. Hey, Rana's not searing. Whoa, what?

Rana's not searing anymore. Yeah, I made it less intense. I don't know what it is about the default lighting, but it is so bright.

Yes, the intensity was, like, max, and the animation was very, the intensity was, but the animation was at the max as well.

[Speaker 4]
In my Pathfinder game, I also have a halo, and I had to turn that way the fuck down, because it was so obnoxiously bright. And while I was at it, I made it so that my token changes its image when my halo's on. That's cool.

[Speaker 6]
Excuse me. Dude.

[Speaker 4]
I wish D&D had more of that kind of stuff, where it would let you, like, change your token when you have certain things on.

[Speaker 5]
Doesn't Pathfinder have, like, a better character creation system?

[Speaker 6]
I personally prefer it.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe I will convince James. To let me run a Pathfinder one-shot for this group. Oh, that would be fun.

[Speaker 5]
I've never played Pathfinder. I really want to, at some point.

[Speaker 3]
It lets you get really niche and customize a lot of your character.

[Speaker 6]
So many, like, random archetypes as well.

[Speaker 2]
It's like, ah, you want to be good with the bioworks? There's a subclass dedicated for that.

[Speaker 6]
Go on. I really want to make a clown juggler.

[Speaker 7]
I tried to make a juggling rogue and it wasn't good.

[Speaker 2]
It was cool in practice, because it saved on having all the poison daggers in the air, but it took an action to maintain it.

[Speaker 7]
And it was just better to... I can't even remember.

[Speaker 2]
Once all the poison daggers were used, it became useless, but I guess at that point... What?

[Speaker 5]
When you say juggling, are you just juggling a bunch of knives and throwing them as you go?

[Speaker 2]
You can juggle anything. It's one-handed and light, I think.

[Speaker 5]
Interesting.

[Speaker 2]
You can juggle items and still use your hands between tosses. You start to juggle with a single item and you can add in a bunch more with an action. In Pathfinder, you've got three actions instead of a main action, a bonus action, and stuff in 5e.

You just get three actions and that covers everything from movement to drawing your weapons and attacking.

[Speaker 5]
All right, that was the same for 5e.

[Speaker 6]
You have to spend a third of your turn maintaining your juggle, and when you do that, you can add an item in.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like one of the common things that I see is that there are pretty much more rules to Pathfinder, but they make sense so it's not hard to remember.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's very intuitive. Once I realized the difference of how circumstance, status, and item bonuses work, I was like, oh, this makes so much sense. Same with spell components, with Concentrate and the other two.

[Speaker 4]
We started at level 2 for my Gatewalkers, and then they all got magic items. It was kind of disappointing because I had Runic Weapon, and I was like, this is going to be such a cool spell, and I had it all prepared. I went to cast it and they're like, oh, both our weapons are plus one striking, and I'm like, why do you have those?

[Speaker 7]
At level 2? Why do they have those?

[Speaker 4]
Because the GM thought that it wasn't going to be overpowered.

[Speaker 2]
Rookie mistake. Running an adventure path has given me a very good idea of when things should be relevant, so I made that mistake. One of my characters died, and they resurrected her, because it's a magical school, there's a bunch of people that could do that.

I was like, hey, I'll just give them an item that's two levels ahead of where they are, because it's a boon from their god, and it completely wiped the floor of the next dungeon. The next time she died, I was like, yep, I'm taking that back. You have performed poorly.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I just think it's funny because it's like, the GM has never run Pathfinder before, and I'm like, how do you know if something is overpowered if you've never run it before?

[Speaker 2]
That's something I really wanted to do with Pathfinder, is not fuck around the game without knowing things. Because I'm always tempted to feel like, oh yeah, I could let you do this maybe as an action, but I'll tend to say no and then I'll read later, and there's a dedicated feat for that ability they wanted to do. So it's like, no, if you want to do that, you need the feat.

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about movement. In Pathfinder as well, with how you can't do things while moving. But I actually really like how the stride action works in Pathfinder.

I was considering changing that as well, but I decided to give it a chance, and I like it so much better.

[Speaker 4]
It's just easier to keep track of too.

[Speaker 2]
It is. Three actions. One, two, three, turned up.

[Speaker 3]
That's why I get confused playing Monk here.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, a bonus action? What is a bonus action?

[Speaker 3]
Another type of action.

[Speaker 1]
Bonus action, bonus action, punch, punch, punch, bonus.

[Speaker 3]
I can just do Flurry of Blows added onto my action. I don't have to buy it or anything.

[Speaker 2]
It's like, ah, Flurry of Blows, you have to take this bonus action after you attack. Oh, does that mean after one punch or two punch of my attack action if I have extra attack? I don't know.

It's rules as written, it is after both punches, but...

[Speaker 6]
For reasons inexplicable to anybody.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, no, it doesn't make sense.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you, Crawford, you fucker. Remember, Jeremy Crawford is Hitler.

[Speaker 6]
I have some rules questions when you have a moment, James.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, let's start off with that. Basically, I just have some extra fights and maybe a negotiation. Probably be a fast session.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. They're called Junic Dagger. It's all about that.

So when I summon the spirits, I can move them, I assume. What is it to use the spirits? Is it an action?

So like, for example, to deal 10 lightning damage between two spirits.

[Speaker 1]
Use two to expend them.

[Speaker 2]
Is it an action to do that?

[Speaker 1]
Is that described? We're going to put that called Junic Dagger.

[Speaker 2]
I've just posted it in the chat. There's no mention of... Using the following effects dismisses the spirits affected.

[Speaker 4]
It does say action in the bottom, but I don't know if that's because it also has an attack.

[Speaker 7]
That is the attack, I think. An action makes sense to me. My next question is...

For the same example, deal 10 lightning damage between two spirits.

[Speaker 2]
Is that to one creature or everything between them?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's everything between.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's straightforward then. They don't have saves. That doesn't make sense.

The illusion, straightforward.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think we talked about the banishment thing. That would be as per the banishment spell.

[Speaker 7]
Yep. I'll add in that it follows my spell save and I'll...

[Speaker 2]
So I'm making a stat block for the spirits so I can place them down and make things easier. It's just using the actions. If that's an action, that's good.

And just moving the spirits. Would they move with me? Do they have a movement speed of 60?

[Speaker 1]
I think what you could do is once per round you can do this.

[Speaker 7]
And they don't technically have a movement speed of 60. You just move them... Within 60 feet of me.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and they would follow you around, I think.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, so if I moved I'd be allowed to reposition them to... Cool, okay.

[Speaker 6]
How often can they move?

[Speaker 1]
The exception is if you want to summon them at your domain. So if you go across the land...

[Speaker 6]
Right, of course.

[Speaker 1]
Killing people and summon them.

[Speaker 2]
Say I stab this Rakshasa, and I summon my spirits around him, and that's my turn. Because I don't have an action left. And he moves.

Am I fine to just move them around him at the start of my turn, then?

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I see what you're doing. So it's not going to cost you an action, but it is going to be like, in a given. It's like, you can do this during your turns.

[Speaker 7]
Right, for the effects of the dagger. So I could stab someone, then banish them in the same round. Yep.

Okay, that makes sense. It's like...

[Speaker 5]
Sorry. About how long do you think... What time do you think we'll be done with this session tonight?

Probably within two hours, to be honest. Okay. I just came back from the party, so...

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah?

[Speaker 5]
No drinking.

[Speaker 7]
That wasn't fun.

[Speaker 5]
So I'm of sane mind. Oh yes, it was. It was very fun.

[Speaker 7]
It was your friend's giving, wasn't it?

[Speaker 5]
Hm?

[Speaker 7]
Was it your friend's giving, or was that...

[Speaker 5]
It was, yes. Very sleepy.

[Speaker 7]
But very eager to play. I do love that.

[Speaker 6]
Who loves friends? Yes. I don't contact them.

So bright. I got the perfect token for my cauldronic spirit. He's spooky looking.

[Speaker 5]
I imagine that's exactly what he looks like.

[Speaker 2]
I was gonna ask you, like, James, what does a cauldronic spirit look like? And I googled spirit bars.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, why would you ask when you could do something so delightful?

[Speaker 6]
Oh my gosh, I love it.

[Speaker 7]
Needs to be a bit smaller. Smallest token can go... I think it's 0.5. Are we attacking this guy?

[Speaker 6]
Not yet. No, he's gonna help.

[Speaker 5]
I don't trust him.

[Speaker 6]
He's gonna quote-unquote help. I don't trust this guy. There we go.

Good. Perfect. Edith hasn't lived this long...

[Speaker 5]
Edith has lived this long by dodging devils.

[Speaker 3]
Because those things are evil. I usually... Never mind.

[Speaker 2]
That works perfectly for the token for the spirits, because they're small. You can just give them all of the abilities. That should just do...

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, perfect. Okay, cauldronic dagger done. Almost, I need to add the rest in.

[Speaker 6]
What did you do? I see it's laying the law. What's going on?

I do have gotten annoyed by... Them.

[Speaker 7]
No, we love people joining in.

[Speaker 1]
You were treading a line. I am happy for you to cross.

[Speaker 6]
Where did you get this art? This is awesome. Crew...

What? Which art? What?

The one that... Is this yours? Uh-huh.

Oh, for... It's Otter's. Yep.

For Hestia? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, that's so fucking good. It's a style... I'm just used to like barely clothed Para.

I was like, ah, it's so much detail. Holy shit.

[Speaker 6]
I barely clothed Para. Is she like Widdy the Pooh? She's in a full outfit.

[Speaker 7]
Someone's replacing me.

[Speaker 6]
No, no, okay. I'm thinking of the doodles.

[Speaker 1]
Thinking of the doodles. Like, I used to imagine those as a nightgown.

[Speaker 6]
I love her hide-a-boob window. It was necessary.

[Speaker 7]
Gotta let the girls breathe.

[Speaker 6]
Honor. Oh. Did you just ban him?

Did you? And he's gone. Gotta respect them boundaries.

Hey, no!

[Speaker 7]
Don't worry, James.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry.

[Speaker 7]
I'll take the booger dragon.

[Speaker 6]
I want the booger dragon.

[Speaker 2]
I already have enough dragons. It's all yours, friend.

[Speaker 3]
I think I might give Monk the booger dragon.

[Speaker 6]
What is it?

[Speaker 5]
How can he... But what is he going to be doing?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. He has acquired a booger dragon.

[Speaker 5]
Various things with various things. None of which is what he's supposed to be doing. And I love it.

[Speaker 4]
How big is it?

[Speaker 5]
Can it eat his bard?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's a wyrmling.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think James would give it to you. No, I know.

[Speaker 3]
It's fine. It was a joke.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna wait as long as I can. And all right. How long do I think this message is going to be?

The session didn't start yet, though.

[Speaker 7]
I just wanted to run a game. How is that bad? Describe in detail what relevance you think...

[Speaker 3]
Session starts when we start talking about our characters and game planning.

[Speaker 2]
I want to plan more, but we're also in frozen time.

[Speaker 1]
I'm waiting for him to like start typing for a while so I can block him then.

[Speaker 5]
You're villainous. I love it.

[Speaker 2]
Like, I didn't want to be mean to him or anything, because he was clearly going through some shit. But after his return, he'd been so fucking annoying.

[Speaker 4]
Here, I'll give you a half-naked parrot. And then I'll delete it. Oh, no.

Everyone's seen it.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. Awesome. Does that say OSHA?

I love it.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, it says, Call me OSHA the way I'm demanding a railing.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god. That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
All right. There we go. Now I'll block.

He's definitely gonna... Yeah, that's a good one. Awesome.

[Speaker 6]
I like that he's still in the foundry. Honestly, I'm surprised he hasn't started talking in the foundry. Kick him from foundry, too.

Did he join foundry?

[Speaker 3]
He's still in foundry, because he...

[Speaker 6]
Chip, you can't see he's typing here.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, but I know that he is. I know that he is.

[Speaker 6]
I don't remember him being quite that bad.

[Speaker 1]
That's because he constantly fucking fell asleep.

[Speaker 6]
This is fair.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, every session he played in, I don't remember one that he was there for all of it.

[Speaker 7]
He didn't.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I remember him a lot, because I remember I would always get annoyed, because he would spend the entire time being like, Hey, you want to hear about my homebrew that I have for my character? And then, like, he would go on about it, even if you didn't say anything.

[Speaker 6]
Because he was excited.

[Speaker 4]
I was like, I get it. You're excited. But oh my god, man, you've told me, like, seven times now.

I know.

[Speaker 2]
My arc was that, but about the bomb descriptions.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't care about the bombs.

[Speaker 6]
Man, just use your bombs.

[Speaker 2]
Give it a... Like, I like Littlerana's abilities. I've just given them all a nice little flavor text and done.

[Speaker 7]
Use the flavor text there.

[Speaker 4]
It's like he constantly thought everyone forgot what it did.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's funny you should mention that, because he apparently thought that I forgot when he asked the same fucking question in downtime twice.

[Speaker 6]
And then asked it for some reason. For some reason.

[Speaker 1]
I see. Now I'm actually nervous. I feel like I should go back and change all the passwords.

[Speaker 7]
I got something logged into, uh...

[Speaker 6]
Login.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Accidentally on purpose.

[Speaker 7]
I have no fucking idea.

[Speaker 6]
He's just a stupid fucking guy. I have a vague idea of what he has.

[Speaker 7]
I'm pretty sure Bar has a... Can you IP, Ben? I pressed Bans, which bans him from the world.

[Speaker 6]
But I don't know if it does anything else. Can you delete his, like... I'm worried because some of the passwords are the same.

It would poof.

[Speaker 4]
I know, I was telling Nessie, I wish Foundry would let players change their own passwords. So you could at least just be like, yeah, here's the default password. Then when you get in, you change it to your password.

[Speaker 1]
I'll chill out with the constant BS and just be a normal fucking player. No, that was your shot, dude!

[Speaker 2]
James, just give me a third chance, please.

[Speaker 3]
That's so funny that he knows. He could say it in his own words, so like...

[Speaker 5]
It's a learning experience for him to be kicked out. So this will be a learning experience for him. Which obviously he needs.

[Speaker 7]
I get the gist of what you mean. I'll chill out with the constant BS. Oh goodness, okay.

All right, I'm just gonna mute this. This is better because that'll be less... I could like, hang his digital corpse.

There we go. I could put it on a stake outside my Discord server.

[Speaker 6]
Do I have a water bottle? There you go.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, all right. Well, now I'm a little distracted admittedly, but...

[Speaker 1]
But where did we leave off last?

[Speaker 2]
Rana had just tried to intimidate this man into getting his meeting.

[Speaker 3]
She succeeded. She didn't just try. She Nat 20'd it.

Pretty sure she Nat 20'd, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Don't sell her short. She might not have succeeded. To organize...

I think he wants to meet with the Necromancer, because... And I want to meet with the Necromancer, but we don't want to go through the city. So hopefully we can meet the Necromancer here in this building, and gank him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I love a good ganking.

[Speaker 2]
That was my interpretation of events, and this guy was like, hmm, perhaps I'm going to be in trouble for that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, and Mr. Rakashakalaka is not a Rakashakalaka right now. I almost choked on my water, you can't do that. I don't actually know how to pronounce it, so I'm just going to pronounce it the closest word that I know.

No, I'm prepared now, so I'll be good.

[Speaker 1]
Is Rakshakalaka. M. Night Shyamalan, everybody's like, oh, you're just being a jerk, and you're pretending it's hard to announce.

I'm like, yeah, it's funny when I do it this way. It's Endearment.

[Speaker 3]
M. Night Keysmash.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, Beanpole Cucumber, everyone does it to his name.

[Speaker 3]
And everybody knows what you mean.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm, it took me a second, all of it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm making your food, hang on. They're following me.

[Speaker 1]
So Mr. Tommy Lee Jones here, Cherry Lee Jones, that she's now been named in the book, she's currently...

[Speaker 3]
I can't hear anything you're saying, that's funny.

[Speaker 4]
I need you to stop talking to eat a pizza.

[Speaker 3]
No, I know, but before that, I couldn't hear anything.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so I was mumbling about the, not the weather, about the date.

[Speaker 6]
So... I'm about jail.

[Speaker 1]
Just screaming internally, you marble-mouthed fuck! He's getting irrationally angry every single fucking time. So, what was I thinking?

Okay, so we're talking about the, yeah, Mr. Cherry Lee Jones here, looking quite dapper inside of his rather delightful... I pressed mute on this guy. How is he still...

What? He's too powerful! He said, you said kick, not ban.

If it was ban, then I would be... I was like, I don't believe you. I actually don't have to do that at all.

[Speaker 4]
No, it is so much funnier when you had the banishment up. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it was funny.

[Speaker 1]
So, Cherry Lee Jones is like, all right, all right, yeah, he's coming. He's on his way. All right, so I don't really know what you folks want me to do here, exactly.

I mean, you're dictating the terms of the arrangement. So, what's your plan? You gonna fight this guy?

[Speaker 2]
I think we have to.

[Speaker 1]
You have to? Oh, man. And you said you didn't want to make any deals.

[Speaker 2]
That is correct.

[Speaker 1]
Bad move. He's side-eyeing the wardens right now.

[Speaker 5]
We don't have to fight.

[Speaker 1]
What's up?

[Speaker 5]
Perhaps we don't have to fight.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I mean, in a manner of speaking, he might just kill you.

[Speaker 5]
Exactly. I've made it this far.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. It's been a good run. It's been a good run.

It has been. You're really bringing my mood down. I've tasted some very delightful mushrooms in my day.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Was that the best 24 hours?

[Speaker 3]
What?

[Speaker 1]
If y'all need a lesser restoration, that'll be on the house this time. I just, you know, I'm feeling bad about what's going on.

[Speaker 3]
Why?

[Speaker 6]
You don't have any installment in this.

[Speaker 1]
You know, I'll just check.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not sure she has a right mind. No, no. That flew away a long ago.

[Speaker 1]
So, uh, while we're waiting here, where do you folks come from?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, all over. Temple.

[Speaker 5]
Lived most of my life there. Figured I'd travel the last bits of my life.

[Speaker 3]
When you've lived a life like I have, it's best to just keep on walking.

[Speaker 5]
All we can hope for.

[Speaker 6]
Gotcha.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes that's all you can do. Wanted posters are everywhere.

[Speaker 5]
I can't even do that. Oh. She holds her back.

[Speaker 3]
Now we get to torture him with just old granny shit. She pulls out a picture book.

[Speaker 6]
You've got pictures. I've got pictures too.

[Speaker 5]
It's just a large book of, like, portraits of her grandson and her son and her late husband.

[Speaker 3]
Hers is probably nature stuff. Mushrooms. Plants.

Certain plants. You don't have to- Some of them have multiple stars on them.

[Speaker 1]
I understand. I understand. You're gonna fight this guy.

Do you know what you're dealing with, really?

[Speaker 5]
You enlighten us, dear.

[Speaker 1]
That's no fun. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

This guy's been alive a long, a long time.

[Speaker 3]
No, haven't we all. Some would say Tom.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he's got a few millennia on you, and he might have a few millennia on me, and I'm not really sure how that's possible, but- Oh, that's incredibly old.

[Speaker 5]
Well, how old are you?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, don't worry about that. Old enough that it's concerning if a human's as old as me. And I'm not talking about the normal wizard stuff, or, you know, a bunch of them are 600 years old.

[Speaker 5]
Do you have a natural lifespan?

[Speaker 1]
A natural lifespan?

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 1]
No, can't say that I do.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Can't say that I do. I, uh, live a little bit longer by virtue of making deals with people. Operating between the space of what is and what could be.

A little bit of life and power. That's the purpose of the face, anyways. And, uh, that's what he's come to me for.

He's got a little bit of trouble raising spirits.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, happens to the best.

[Speaker 3]
Corporeal undead, he's fine with. He's just gonna giggle.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I think a pharmacist could help with that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's so funny until you see the soulfire out back.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we've already seen it.

[Speaker 5]
And is he responsible for this?

[Speaker 1]
So, here's the thing, is the soulfire I don't think is actually something he could do on his own. I think he's had help. I think he has other helpers, and that's one of the things he's coming to me for.

Is a final bit of help.

[Speaker 5]
And what will he do with your help? Do you have any idea?

[Speaker 1]
So, there was a... I think he really wants to fix this whole spirit problem. I figure, but hear me out here.

He can do things which cause spirits to be raised, but he can't really control them. He can't really solve. I think that if somebody of his particular skill were to, you know, get a hold of him, it would be...

Crack the doors wide open.

[Speaker 6]
And let more in? Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Well, in somewhere. Don't know if he would be here, but he'd do it somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
We can't let this happen.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, we could. He might do it somewhere else.

[Speaker 5]
It doesn't matter where he does it. He sure shouldn't.

[Speaker 1]
He definitely shouldn't.

[Speaker 3]
Is there any way we could stop him?

[Speaker 1]
I'll be my guest.

[Speaker 3]
And you'll just cheer us on from the sidelines?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, uh, bad things happen if I die.

[Speaker 6]
Oh?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I just want to avoid that sort of...

[Speaker 3]
That sounds interesting.

[Speaker 1]
Vase doesn't take kindly to me. Except other people's blood doesn't take kindly to mine.

[Speaker 3]
Does it? The vase doesn't like you or...

[Speaker 1]
It's a little complicated. I know that the vase looks like the vessel for me, but it's more like I'm the vessel for you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! What about your friend?

[Speaker 1]
What friend?

[Speaker 3]
I forgot his name.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the necromancer.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Is that what you mean?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think we were given a name. Oh, Old Scratch.

[Speaker 3]
We were. It's like Mr. Bix. It's like, yeah, Old Scratch.

[Speaker 1]
Warnings. All I know, all I know is I was put here for a reason. You know, I had a few different users over the past.

Deep Elf that got passage in here. There was a Duergar. He really had to mess around in order to get up this way.

Gave him a pretty nifty gun. Who else was it? It was the...

The last owner was a big fan of dogs.

[Speaker 5]
Do you think that we could feasibly fight this necromancer without losing all of our lives?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's hard to... So the problem when you talk about necromancers is they always come back. One way or another.

You spend enough time with Undeath and eventually you're just the sort of person who comes back.

[Speaker 5]
Could you help with this?

[Speaker 1]
Could I help with this?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 7]
I could certainly try. It's worth a bargain. I think the trick is in not killing them.

[Speaker 6]
Subduing. Grab them, then? Mm-hmm.

That little doohickey that we got you out of.

[Speaker 5]
What's that? Could that...

[Speaker 3]
Could we trap him in that little doohickey that we got you out of? The vase, darling.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, the vase is, uh... Yeah, I'm still bound to the vase. I'm just bound to the vase.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, can two people share it? Mm-mm. I don't think he wants a roommate.

Oh!

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that he would take... He wouldn't really take to it. It's not made for...

Whatever his sword happens to be.

[Speaker 5]
Well, what would this bargain be?

[Speaker 1]
I don't suppose you'd part with your soul over there, would you?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, anything else, dear?

[Speaker 1]
You know what? Just for you folks, I think... I think that we could strike a...

A void in that sort of thing. I have a few business partners that I think would be interested in just how strong you are. I think if I really put my mind to it...

[Speaker 4]
I'm not strong at all!

[Speaker 1]
If I really put my mind to it, I think a little bit of that magic note might just come in handy to them. So, I think the idea is I get a little bit of blood, you get some cold iron spikes, and I think you hammer him into some place that he's not gonna escape from.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, I don't suppose I'll be doing that. We got some other materials.

[Speaker 5]
You said you need our blood?

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Do I... Would I recognize anything that he'd use it for? Like, any ideas that, being a cleric, I would know?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go ahead and roll me a religion tracking. Okay. You could use either intelligence or wisdom for this.

All right. Change them.

[Speaker 5]
Intelligence or wisdom... Um, arcana or religion, you said, right?

[Speaker 1]
Just religion.

[Speaker 2]
Religion with intelligence or wisdom.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I don't know shit. I could never encounter this before.

[Speaker 1]
So, Edith, I'm gonna start with you. You're aware that blood packs are used to seal a deal and cause terrible pain to the, uh, cause terrible pain to whoever the recipient or, or the plaintiff is, basically, if they don't obey the terms of the agreement.

[Speaker 5]
Wonderful.

[Speaker 1]
And sometimes it could just be used... It was a pretty low DC for each, was it? Uh, using the, uh, what is it?

It's also used for methods of exchange. So if the person has any kind of, uh, if the person has any kind of, let's say, horde or stash or library of boons and blessings, some of those being literal, they can, they could use blood to draw them out, basically. And they use that to replenish themselves in the exchange.

And take a little bit off the top. Breed. You are aware that, you know what?

It's usually a bit of witchcraft, actually, that does this. It's usually bargains with either, either, let's say, female-coded fiends and fey. Occasionally female-coded, uh, magic users.

Witches.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's interesting. I'm just gonna ask him out, right?

[Speaker 5]
What are you going to do with our blood?

[Speaker 1]
Gonna use it to give you folks some spikes, and you can use it to hammer it into the fellow. That's what I get. Take a little bit off the top.

It's, uh, business associates are going to get some of your spell slots. When they ask for them.

[Speaker 5]
Of? Like every once in a while, just randomly?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
You could always refuse if it means a lot to you.

[Speaker 5]
It's for a good cause. And I am retiring soon. What?

[Speaker 6]
She's an old lady. No!

[Speaker 5]
Perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad deal.

[Speaker 1]
It is for a good cause. You see, some of my business associates are in competition with someone you don't like too much. The fiend's a left-hand woman, I guess.

[Speaker 5]
Who is that?

[Speaker 1]
Name's Theresia.

[Speaker 5]
Remind me.

[Speaker 1]
You ever see a shrine to the green god of Orton?

[Speaker 5]
Have I? I think I have.

[Speaker 1]
Masked face. No real features except for, uh, elk horns coming out of the eyes.

[Speaker 5]
Interesting. Uh, I don't think... Maybe, would Edith have?

[Speaker 1]
I'm almost certain that Edith has. I know that you personally are aware of it.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know if Edith has seen it. Because I think, um, I think, who was it? It was Cerys that ran into that in the woods, I believe, right?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Cerys has more than once.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. So I'm not terribly, uh, you know, we're not terribly keen on her getting... I mean, she's wearing the skin of a god right now.

Nobody's too happy about it. I mean, she's seeking something that's even more important. Maybe just as important.

We wouldn't want her to have more than she could... We wouldn't want her to bite off more than she could chew. So we're just gonna stop her from doing that.

[Speaker 5]
This is to stop Undead Horde, right? Basically.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I mean, Theresia is... I mean, you're doing this to stop the Undead Horde. We're also doing this to stop Theresia.

It's seen as... I'm not... I mean, I'm ambivalent towards the Undead Horde, but you folks don't seem to like it too much, and you don't seem to like Theresia.

And my business partners, to who I am answering, of course, don't seem to like Theresia at all. They're not too keen on the whole spirits-unleashed thing. You know.

[Speaker 5]
What's dead should stay dead.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Couldn't agree more.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm gonna have to take this deal. I can't idly sit by, because I don't think we can fight against that person.

[Speaker 3]
Did he say that he could take a bit of us down the road? Is that what I heard?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he could take some spell slots from you down the road.

[Speaker 5]
And how exactly would... Spikes. What do these spikes do?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm going with a little bit of... What am I thinking here? I got a nice little volatile material.

Actually, wait. You know what? No.

No, so the idea is that you're gonna drive some stakes into him. Just in all the right places that he stays alive, or in between life and death. And then he stays there.

You don't have to worry about him anymore.

[Speaker 5]
Until what?

[Speaker 1]
Hopefully until nothing. I'd prefer it if he just stayed there, because I don't think he's going to be terribly happy with it.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think he'll be happy with anybody who does this.

[Speaker 5]
We're on the same page. I'm gonna have to take this deal.

[Speaker 3]
We would have to take him to a location where no one can get to him?

[Speaker 7]
Well, I mean, you could. I'm sure that you could figure something out.

[Speaker 6]
We can keep him.

[Speaker 7]
We can find a place.

[Speaker 5]
I've made my decision. I'm definitely going to take this deal, unfortunately.

[Speaker 3]
And while I can't very well let you do it alone, so if you're going to do it, then choose company.

[Speaker 5]
Are you sure, dear?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I've done a lot of stuff. I can't remember. I probably won't remember this.

Fine.

[Speaker 2]
This is a terrible idea, you know?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we can fight against this ever-existing being millennia's older than us. It's a lot of time.

[Speaker 2]
The last time we faced him, he ran away.

[Speaker 1]
Well, tactical retreat never hurt no one.

[Speaker 5]
If we fail, many undead will be unleashed.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, it's not necessarily him that you have to worry about, so far as, like, he's so scary, and he's so big, and he's so tough. It's just, you know, he's bringing the Nightwalker around, and I would be a little frightened of something like this.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, could we try it a little bit both ways? We try to fight him, and if it doesn't work, we make the pact?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I'm going to be a little preoccupied.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, go ahead, Landon.

[Speaker 2]
Can Rana do a, uh, a story check on, a religion check on Nightwalkers?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you all can.

[Speaker 2]
Can I use wisdom?

[Speaker 3]
Well, you don't have to yell about it.

[Speaker 1]
Can I do a wisdom religion check? Fine, it was a joke. Everybody make a...

Well, it could be a knowledge check of your choices.

[Speaker 2]
If it's a wisdom religion, that would be ideal.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
My wisdom and intelligence are the same, so... Oh, man, I got the exact same thing. Okay, I've got to put the kids to bed.

They're yelling at me. Should we take a break?

[Speaker 7]
Maybe take a fast break.

[Speaker 1]
I hope you guys are ready to blow, like, just your biggest spell slots that you have access to.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
I have two.

[Speaker 5]
Like I said, she can't allow this to happen with a good conscience.

[Speaker 3]
I saved all of my spells for this. Obviously it was because I thought it was something else, but...

[Speaker 2]
A lot of the party's death warded as well. We should...

[Speaker 4]
If Rana knows... Is everybody death warded?

[Speaker 2]
Edith is. I am not. We're fine with dying.

[Speaker 4]
I thought you death warded yourself. No, you death warded Deidre.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And Rana death warded herself. And, uh, Hestia.

[Speaker 5]
I'm kind of nervous I'm gonna die. I don't want to.

[Speaker 2]
You just said you were ready.

[Speaker 5]
No, no, she is, but I'm not.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not either. You death warded Hestia?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I did. I did both myself and Hestia.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 2]
I have no fourth level spell slots left. Um, if it's just a regular Nightwalker, I have a plan if Rana knows about Nightwalker.

[Speaker 5]
We've got plans. Well, I mean, after being told about them, you would definitely know about them.

[Speaker 2]
Well, the last time we fought a Nightwalker, it was not just a regular Nightwalker, and it killed our poor wild magic sorcerer.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. Wait, what do you mean not a regular Nightwalker?

[Speaker 2]
That guy was cooked, man. Nightwalkers... I think he had, like, legendary resistances and stuff.

If it's just a regular one, they've got, like, a minus two or something to charisma, and you can just, like, banish them. Easy. You can cheese Nightwalkers super hard because they don't have mental stats, so you can just, like, bind them into service.

Um, which is probably what this Necromancer's done. They're really big and scary, but they're not smart. So yes, we just banish it and kill the Necromancer.

Easy peasy. That's why Rana has the spell, uh, Dispel Good and Evil. It will send the Nightwalker back to the Shadowfell, or whatever James's equivalent is.

[Speaker 5]
Do you think we could do that without making the deal?

[Speaker 2]
Rana is confident, and making the deal is a terrible idea because it's a devil, and it'll probably make you use your spell slot to kill a family or something.

[Speaker 5]
Well, yeah, you got a point.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, and you put it like that. Jeez.

[Speaker 2]
Rana is obviously prejudiced against this guy, but he is evil. This man is evil. He makes evil deals for a living.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, what the hell? If we're gonna die at his hand, or the Necromancer's hand, let's die dying.

[Speaker 6]
Well...

[Speaker 2]
No, that's the worst part. You're not even gonna die if you make the pact. He's just gonna, like, bind you into service.

It's worse.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty, we'll just take our chances. I guess we should... Just take our chances with the Necromancer.

[Speaker 5]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 7]
I'm positive.

[Speaker 5]
This could end terribly.

[Speaker 2]
Rana won't compromise her morals. You are welcome to, if you would like.

[Speaker 5]
Have you had dealings with devils before, dear?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's one of the conditions of the book I read. I cannot perform evil acts, and I will not associate with evil creatures.

[Speaker 5]
Probably for the best. Should we try...

[Speaker 2]
I will not stop you from making the pact, but if you do, I will not associate with you after this.

[Speaker 5]
Aww! Maybe I should make the pact, because, like, the more you talk about it, the more convincing it is to not do.

[Speaker 2]
This is a man that lives by making people make pacts. It will be to his advantage.

[Speaker 5]
And only to his advantage, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Thing is, it's not like there won't be benefits for us, but... I don't think that...

[Speaker 5]
We're losing Kahn. And you're confident that we can take on this enemy without...

[Speaker 2]
I am confident in my own abilities.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I trust you. Perhaps it's not such a good idea after all.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. Gigi was just doing what her friends do in solidarity.

[Speaker 2]
Ana's just been sitting in the corner glaring at this dude the entire time before chiming in on this.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Edith definitely doesn't like... does not like this devil, but really doesn't want running about.

[Speaker 3]
Especially if he's gonna use us to do bad things.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so everybody's back, so...

[Speaker 3]
No. No. I'm just changing diapers and getting a bottle ready.

[Speaker 1]
No, I was just going to say... Well, as soon as you can hear me, I can...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so we got... Starting with Hestia, with history. You know that Nightwalkers are from...

Nightwalkers are from the Tempest, which is a... Or have appeared in text mentioning the Tempest. Something about the City of the Dead, Tiranamar.

Anybody else who was there for that session? Okay. No, the characters here were there for that session, which is funny.

But it's developed basically by... It's occasionally taken from the cast, which is something else, but throughout history... That's more a comment.

Throughout history, the appearance of Nightwalkers usually indicates some kind of powerful extra planar creature being used to summon them. Normally, humans don't do it at all. Or mortals don't do it, like, at all.

Something else has to be used as a medium to summon the creature.

[Speaker 6]
Nasty.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Edith rolled Arcana. So Edith knows it's from the City of the Dead and from the Maelstrom that kind of surrounds it.

The Maelstrom only really parts... The Maelstrom can be... Or sorry, the Tempest can be more or less severe, depending on your location in the City of the Dead and following sort of weird arcane weather patterns.

But only ever truly disappears when the Ashen Coil arrives. But... I'm sorry, can you say that last part?

Only truly disappears whenever the Ashen Coil arrives.

[Speaker 6]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
The Ashen Coil will sometimes... You just know this is part of your own religion and that it attacks the City of the Dead, attempting to carry wraiths back home.

[Speaker 5]
So what does that exactly mean?

[Speaker 1]
What their final destination is. That's basically all you know for, like, of them, basically. They get dropped off by the Tempest, primarily.

Because I think you got... Yeah, you got 11.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Rana knows with a religion skill check. Rana knows that there has to be a sacrifice involved. Even though, like, extra-planar preachers are used to...

are levied to produce these rituals, there's usually an innocent that is sacrificed and used to draw out something from the Tempest into the City of the Dead. This usually turns said innocent into a wraith. And they can sometimes be found.

A wraith can be very, very useful. It does happen in your church's order. It's treated with some degree of sensitivity because there's a lot of people, especially the younger clerics, are generally interested.

Like, no, it's a wraith. We have to destroy it. But the older in the church are typically a little bit more nuanced about it.

Like, all right, we're going to destroy it. We're going to put the soul to rest. But part of how we're going to do that is by helping to resolve whatever killed it, basically.

Gives them a little bit more information. Featuring you only know of Nightwalkers as Witherers. Or Withers, I guess.

Any of their appearances herald the destruction of natural life. They are profane unto the world. And Druids do not treat them kindly and do not like them.

But Druids don't have a lot of options when fighting said Nightwalkers.

[Speaker 3]
No, we're talking about the Withers.

[Speaker 7]
Nope!

[Speaker 1]
Sometimes the natural world can be petitioned, basically, for an aid system. And then whatever you guys know about the Nightwalker stat blocks you're free to use. That is the core dump.

[Speaker 5]
You said they're in the absence of the Ashen Coil?

[Speaker 1]
The Tempest. So there's a big storm that surrounds the City of the Dead, referred to as the Tempest.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
And it'll, like, dredge up memories and monsters and myths that will sometimes assault the cities or dump these either creatures or objects directly on top of it or upon the realm. I keep saying city, but it's a realm unto itself that has a lot of urban architecture, if you will. And the only time that the storm actually completely clears is whenever the Ashen Coil comes to attempt to take a bunch of Wraiths to whatever their final destination is supposed to be.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. You wouldn't happen to have, like, a document talking about the deities of the land, would you?

[Speaker 1]
The Ashen Coil? Not much. You know, I should put more...

If you give me those requests in, like, little bite-size formats, I will feed you more information as time goes on.

[Speaker 2]
You should instead join a call while James is running a session and ask for it then.

[Speaker 1]
That's a great idea.

[Speaker 6]
I might do that.

[Speaker 1]
For, like, in the middle of a break or something and somebody does that, I'm fine. I do have one note.

[Speaker 5]
I'd get to know the God of Death really quickly.

[Speaker 2]
James, why am I muted? Can you unmute me? I need to ask you something.

[Speaker 6]
How ridiculous.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Anyone got a way to resist necrotic damage?

[Speaker 5]
Um, I could check.

[Speaker 3]
I might. I can't.

[Speaker 2]
Well, being near a Nightwalker, bad.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I do have Sanctuary that I could cast over someone.

[Speaker 4]
Alas, my resistance is to Radiant damage.

[Speaker 3]
I'm pretty sure mine is to Cold.

[Speaker 2]
What? Grace just has Radiant.

[Speaker 7]
Are you an SME? Yeah. I think they're both, don't they?

[Speaker 4]
I only see Radiant unless you know what the necrotic one is. Is it different?

[Speaker 1]
I think Scourge is the necrotic one.

[Speaker 2]
I thought they were a lineage and all of them. Yeah, in Modern Kanem Presents Models of the Multiverse, it's both. Did you use the older one for it?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I think I used the newer one. Yeah, I used the Modern Kanem version because I have the Radiant Soul. Yeah, that, um...

Oh, Celestial Resistance is what it's called. It is! I do have resistance to necrotic.

[Speaker 5]
How do you get resistance to necrotic? Like, what spells?

[Speaker 2]
Potions. Potions of resistance. Like, maybe Amumade from a Black Dragon.

I think they deal necrotic. Or maybe they're acid. It's probably a necrotic dragon.

[Speaker 5]
I need, being a, you know, a Great Cleric, I need stuff like that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll have a quick look through all of the Cleric spells that we have access to, but I definitely don't have one prepared for that. Protection from evil and good would give some disadvantage. It's not helpful.

Well, it is helpful, of course, but...

[Speaker 5]
It's not for what we're looking for.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Protection from poison does poison conditions. Not useful.

Anti-life shield is the opposite. Only zombies can move through it. That's cool.

Very useful. No, I don't see anything in the Cleric spell list that gives necrotic resistance. False life gives you MPHP.

[Speaker 1]
Keeper is the better looking. You guys are like, Best we got as far as spells go, we're going to be doing spike growth. I think we each got an ensnaring strike.

[Speaker 3]
We do have moonbeam.

[Speaker 1]
Moonbeam's good.

[Speaker 3]
I have, um...

[Speaker 1]
Somebody roll me an insight. Deidre, roll me an insight check right now.

[Speaker 3]
Picking a diaper.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hold on a second. I can roll for you. I can just put...

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm putting on the rash cream as we speak.

[Speaker 1]
I believe it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, you got a big bonus to it. All right.

[Speaker 7]
I believe, uh, you notice Cherry Lee Jones adjusts his collar ever so slightly.

[Speaker 1]
When you mention moonbeam.

[Speaker 3]
I think she'd just politely smile at him.

[Speaker 5]
What does that imply?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Yeah. Moonbeam removes, um, shapeshifter magic.

Um.

[Speaker 3]
I also got the impression that they were either a witch or a fae, right?

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, he's working for some witches.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Witches don't have- Fuck yeah, there were supposed to be witches over here, weren't there? That's my out of character knowledge.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's pretty convinced this guy's a fiend.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody who came back, uh, who came from that area told as many people as they could, there's fucking zombies in the woods, there's dragons flying overhead, and I'm pretty sure I saw some lady with a crooked nose and a, uh, big fucking wart.

[Speaker 6]
Good for her.

[Speaker 1]
In the Dwarven Hold, uh, it's lights went out.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Good job. Okay.

Well.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so.

[Speaker 3]
Mommoth's ready.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, oh, get that baby up.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we need to try and banish the Nightwalker, though. If Rana dies, then probably run. Uh, it will try and paralyze you and, uh, eat you.

If this thing kills you, you can't be brought back to life.

[Speaker 5]
Wonderful.

[Speaker 2]
Typically. I can't remember how Pete's character was brought back to life.

[Speaker 1]
I think it was with a wish.

[Speaker 4]
May him back. Oh wait, like Armorin died?

[Speaker 2]
No, he made a, um, sorcerer.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, did the sorcerer come back to life? I don't remember him coming back to life.

[Speaker 2]
He did. Uh, we... Sierra's keep, there was a Nightwalker there.

We killed it after... The first try, we got our asses handed to us.

[Speaker 4]
And I think I was there for the second try.

[Speaker 2]
The second try, we had everyone and Aaron recorded plant growth and it pissed me off. But strength in numbers, we won. That guy was cooked.

That guy was something else. He...

[Speaker 1]
He had legendary resistances, but otherwise he was, he was raw. Oh.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Legendary resistances was enough, I guess. We weren't able to stun him. If this guy doesn't though, we just have to banish him.

James is a Necromancer. He's probably counted as undead, right? If he's lived for that long.

I'll try and hit the Necromancer to spell evil and good, because he'll go back to... The Shadowfell as well.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we're not going to spike him this time.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if we don't do the deal, we don't have spikes here. You're welcome to give up a bit of your magic to kill families or something.

[Speaker 4]
I've got two spell slots, I'm not giving shit up. Yeah, she's a warlock.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sure, I'm sure Hammers are hiding under the hospice. I'm sure they're there. The fireball in the hospital is necessary to not kill Hammers, but...

[Speaker 1]
Listen, it makes me feel better when I uh, no. Okay, so.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, everyone stay back from the Nightwalker. I will try and deal with it. I'll try and pin the Necromancer and kill him.

I'll not kill him. I'll try and banish. We need to banish him as well.

[Speaker 4]
Does anyone else have banishing?

[Speaker 2]
We'll dispel evil and good last for a minute. So I get 10 rounds of trying to banish creatures while I concentrate on it, so. First, we'll try and banish the Nightwalker.

[Speaker 1]
I think banish is when you dismiss, right? Sorry? Is it dismissal?

[Speaker 2]
You could, you get two functions. You can either break enchantment or use the dismissal function. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack.

[Speaker 1]
You can banish a spell early by using either of the three special functions.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, fuck. Okay, um. Really good spell.

You're right. Um, well. Does anyone else have a 4th level spell slot to cast banishment?

[Speaker 3]
I have 4th level, but- I do not have banishment.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, okay, okay. It's okay. The Colgenic Dagger can banish.

And it just uses my spell save, as we established last time. We can use the dagger to banish the Nightwalker. And I can dispel evil and good on the Necromancer to send him to the Shadowfell.

Easy. Done. Is the Colgenic Dagger attunement, James?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 2]
If Rana dies, someone grab the dagger and either run away or finish the job.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
One thing that Caber was saying earlier was like, maybe we chain him anyways, if you guys want.

[Speaker 2]
What would we chain him with?

[Speaker 1]
Like, without making a deal? We're in a torture room. There's a shit ton of- Oh, just regular chains.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we are in a torture room. Well, regular chains will hold this monster.

[Speaker 1]
They could ratchet strap into that door over there and probably- For how long?

[Speaker 5]
Rust eventually.

[Speaker 4]
Well, it'll be long enough to banish him. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. For somebody figuring out how to deal with him, if he is going to come back, there's bias. Or just bias and time.

What about this one here? Do we just- We could always kick his babies down that shaft. It's at this moment that the ground begins shaking.

Oh, the rest of the building.

[Speaker 2]
We should fight him where there's space.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, where do we want to go?

[Speaker 6]
Down the shaft?

[Speaker 3]
That's- That leads us to the water?

[Speaker 4]
Well, it's a quick way out.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it can't be sanitary. Okay, well, if it's a quick way out, we have to move the barrier we put in front of it.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, if you all- Oh, I forgot about the barrier. Mr. Cherry at this point is like, Hey, just put me in the other room, unless you want him to come in here while you're in here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so we should throw you down the shaft?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I meant the main room.

[Speaker 2]
I see so many tokens on the battle board.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, do we want to move him down into the other room?

[Speaker 2]
I kind of want to fight down in that room.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
I think we just leave him up here and we move.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, he's- I mean, if he's not gonna go anywhere. And it's not like we need him to stay here or anything. Oh, that might be a little too much.

I was gonna say we could put him in the wax. Like, put him back in his vase and put the vase in the wax. That might be too much.

[Speaker 5]
Prison the fool.

[Speaker 3]
Hello, I am sad that he won't be there to battle with us.

[Speaker 5]
He's too selfish, too. Damn devil.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but I wanted to do my moonbeam on him.

[Speaker 6]
Fine.

[Speaker 7]
All righty, is everybody ready to begin?

[Speaker 2]
I have a question about the Culchinic Dagger.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah?

[Speaker 2]
I damaged myself to summon Spirit.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Well, how long do the Spirits last for? Can I stab myself now to have Spirits as battle starts?

[Speaker 1]
That seems reasonable.

[Speaker 5]
You just stab yourself and we're all like, hey, what are you doing?

[Speaker 1]
Would you do me a huge favor and just put a little counter under your character thread or something like that that indicates how many times you're doing?

[Speaker 6]
Sure.

[Speaker 5]
That's so specific. What?

[Speaker 7]
No reason in particular.

[Speaker 2]
I'll add a resource on my character sheet for times stabbed by Culchinic Dagger.

[Speaker 1]
Right, put the number of hit points spent on that particular.

[Speaker 2]
All right, let's roll some damage. Seven, perfect. That's always going to be seven.

Good number. All right, I have seven Spirits.

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and put them on the board.

[Speaker 3]
Down here, right? We're doing it over here. Yeah.

We tuck our... Evase friend. Away.

[Speaker 1]
How do you do that?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. How do we do that? Do we want to even tuck him away or do we want to just be like, peace and leave him there?

[Speaker 2]
That's what Rana was going to do. Rana hates that guy.

[Speaker 3]
Because like we could still put the vase in that wax to hide it better.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like he's supposed to be in the blood though, right? Like there was something about that. I think once he was out, he needs to stay in the blood.

[Speaker 2]
Can we move the corpse pile out of the room?

[Speaker 5]
Like, are those are those dead people?

[Speaker 4]
That's XP counting. That's the last session's dead people.

[Speaker 1]
We have set up the perimeter. Hit point wise.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna assume a kind of hidden spot over here. Maybe.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's animated shield will be active. Her spellcasting focus and her dagger will be drawn. Let's fight some zombies.

[Speaker 4]
I would prefer to be over here because they're going to be coming through.

[Speaker 2]
Do auras go through doors, James?

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, they're going to be over here, aren't they?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, full cover.

[Speaker 1]
We'll keep them.

[Speaker 4]
They're going to be coming through probably here and then the balconies is my guess.

[Speaker 2]
If you can hide behind a door.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to put a spike rose down if you guys would like.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, near the doors leading outside. Probably the balcony doors is fine.

[Speaker 5]
I don't have any really. I have one damage though. The rest are buffs.

So I'm going to stay back and try to help people.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I haven't died. That's a concentration. Oh, no.

I don't want a second one.

[Speaker 3]
Flippin' concentration spells. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's not really a good place for a darkness.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
I could summon some bugs. Yeah. That lasts for 10 minutes.

It's concentration though, so I wouldn't be able to do moonbeam right away.

[Speaker 5]
The first thing I'm probably going to do is cast bless, but I don't want to do that until the fighting starts because it only lasts a minute.

[Speaker 3]
We want 10 centipedes, 3 spiders, 5 wasps. They all become giant or 1 scorpion.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I like the sound of wasps.

[Speaker 4]
Alrighty then. It's bugs' time.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I need 5 giant wasps. Can I get that from plutonium?

[Speaker 1]
You can get a giant wasp from plutonium.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Don't have to do any... Ooh.

Don't have to do any back alley deals. That's good.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I think the giant wasp is just in the SRD content. Well, if you... They should just be able to import.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Where is you?

[Speaker 3]
Oh man, I want a giant walrus. That'd be hilarious.

[Speaker 6]
Did I get it? I don't know where I went.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Oh, I think a wild shaped me. Oh.

Yeah, I'm wild shaped. How do I undo that?

[Speaker 2]
For reference, the nightwalker is a big scary dude. He's huge. He has like horns.

If we see him, we want him to come into the room. So just shut the doors and wait for him to approach.

[Speaker 1]
All ready. So, is everybody ready?

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna just heal back the damage I took.

[Speaker 3]
My sheet got turned into a scorpion, so...

[Speaker 5]
Do I have time to cast a spell that'll last for a minute? Or like... Or will it just end before the combat can start?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what spell is it? Uh, Bless. Bless?

Yeah, yeah. You'd have a pretty good, uh... Pretty good idea of when shit was about to go down.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, as soon as shit's about to start going down, I'm gonna cast Bless really quickly. That way we get the most out of it. I'm gonna go ahead and cast.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, just an action to cast.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and add yourself to the initial count.

[Speaker 5]
And I'm...

[Speaker 4]
Hey James, how do you un-wild shape someone?

[Speaker 1]
Fantastic question.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know what happened.

[Speaker 3]
I broke my character sheet.

[Speaker 4]
I would assume it would be in effects. There's nothing in effects, though.

[Speaker 6]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm gonna... Bless, Rana, Hestia, and...

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Who else? Great question.

[Speaker 1]
I would delete and just put your... No, delete your token and put your character back on the board. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
So, Deidre, Rana, and Hestia. You guys get blessed.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Why do you roll the best?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I see what you did. Oh, you did? Oh, good.

No, I didn't. Never mind.

[Speaker 3]
This is a different...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. You polymorph an actor by dragging the actor into a character sheet.

[Speaker 3]
I'm still a scorpion.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, um... It is not saying how to undo it. Maybe...

Through the wild shape.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, can you drag a new sheet out? Or a new token?

[Speaker 4]
Nope, nope. It, she done it to her sheet. Oh, she polymorphed them into...

It is telling me how to do it. It is not telling me how to undo it. Um...

Well, it is probably supposed to be easy. So, looking at this... There should be a module?

Or a macro? No, I don't see a macro.

[Speaker 2]
Looking at this fight positively, what is everyone going to do when they level up?

[Speaker 5]
If they level up, you mean? Are we going to get that far? Never do what I did again.

[Speaker 2]
We are going to win. We are going to win. It is fine.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I don't believe you, but okay.

[Speaker 3]
Did I screw my sheet up?

[Speaker 1]
You might have.

[Speaker 3]
I might have. Damn it.

[Speaker 2]
I might just quickly grab a snack.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that is fine.

[Speaker 6]
Not bad.

[Speaker 4]
I am trying to see if I can find any sort of documentation about how it is supposed to work, because... That is interesting.

[Speaker 1]
It is only able to revert if you have the link... With link actor data enabled.

[Speaker 4]
I think the problem is she dragged it directly onto her sheet.

[Speaker 3]
I didn't, though. I just hit import.

[Speaker 4]
You didn't? Okay, then it should be easy to get out of it, though. But the fact that it is your main sheet, weird.

[Speaker 1]
I can't even understand how to do this.

[Speaker 2]
I see why Morgan never wild shapes. Yeah, that is a beast. Nefarious is a beast.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Use... We'll start off with the player view. Just like D&D Beyond stats.

We're going to go ahead and pick the actor we want to change into, drag it onto the player character sheet, select whether we are using wild shape or polymorph or custom settings.

[Speaker 1]
We'll see the appearance of the token changes, as well as the character sheet has changed as well. And then if we are finished, we can just click restore transformation at the top. Do you have a D&D Beyond character sheet that you used to make this?

Did you have a D&D Beyond character sheet that you used to make Deidre originally?

[Speaker 3]
Nope. Nope. I made her in here.

I know. I think I would have to remake her sheet, and that sucks for... So I would...

I don't know. I don't want to do that in the middle of combat.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Can you share your screen? Yeah, sure. I don't know how that would help, but yeah.

Well then I'd be able to see what's going on on your side, and if there's anything you can see that I can't. Oh yeah, that's true. Because maybe, just maybe...

If you go up to the plutonium menu, if you click on polymorpher... Nope, not enabled. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I already... I clicked on that, and it's not showing me...

[Speaker 4]
You have two Deidre's. You have three Deidre's. Why don't you...

[Speaker 3]
Okay, and we tried to make a copy and then realized that that was dumb, so I made a second one to remake.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. What happens if you hit the DAE?

[Speaker 1]
Wait, wait! Nessie. What?

Click on your character. Just the selector token. Press ctrl-z.

[Speaker 3]
Token. A bunch.

[Speaker 1]
I mean a lot.

[Speaker 3]
Doing it.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe... Oh, do it on the virtual tabletop. So click and drag to make sure that it's not targeting a different element, and then just keep pressing ctrl-z, and we'll know if something happens if Deidre...

[Speaker 3]
I drug it on there, and I'm a wasp.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just keep hitting ctrl-z. Where's your character?

[Speaker 3]
Up by the ice giant.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I can't... Oh, that's the ice giant.

[Speaker 6]
She's down here.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hello. Yep, just keep pressing.

[Speaker 4]
I'm hostile.

[Speaker 3]
If I press ctrl-z, my token goes away.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, do that, and then just keep pressing it.

[Speaker 6]
Just keep going. Eww, I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Just trying to see how much you can undo.

[Speaker 1]
I believe.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see, um...

[Speaker 3]
How do I know if anything's happening?

[Speaker 4]
Is James moving things?

[Speaker 1]
No, I was pressing ctrl-z to see if something would happen on my end, and then...

[Speaker 4]
Nothing. Okay, can you press D-A-E at the top next to your... Yeah, that thing.

Okay, close out of that. Click on sheet. That's just...

Oh, that's just that stupid sheet. You've been turned into a giant wasp. Um, um, um, um, um, um...

I don't think... Yeah, I'm not finding anything. Like, they're just like...

Oh, yeah, if you want to un-wild shape, you just un-wild shape. So I feel like that's not...

[Speaker 7]
Oops, that...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I got nothing.

[Speaker 1]
All right, uh, Deidre, my recommendation, just make a character real quick. Um, try to remember...

[Speaker 3]
I was gonna say, can I drag Monk in? He just lands in.

[Speaker 7]
Is that possible?

[Speaker 1]
Um, tell you what, what's... What was Deidre's initiative? What's Deidre's guess?

[Speaker 3]
Zero. It was zero. It was zero?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you're not until initiative zero.

[Speaker 3]
That has the same as a wasp.

[Speaker 1]
You have until initiative zero to do as much of Deidre as you can.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, that's the other thing you could do. Just start in wild shape while you're making Deidre on the back end.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll just play as a wasp. I'm a wasp now.

[Speaker 2]
That's like two rounds of time to build Deidre.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right, and Hestia, you need to roll initiative.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I woke this up first. It's just kind of a fly on.

Sorry, I gotta do this.

[Speaker 2]
It's fine.

[Speaker 5]
Rana is blessed.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, within the bright light.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, of course.

[Speaker 2]
It did specify my shield was active.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. This is not an undead. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
That's a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Miss anyways.

[Speaker 2]
Miss.

[Speaker 6]
All righty.

[Speaker 2]
The shield just like darts in front of its hand and now.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that is our turn. We come down to Rana. All right.

Uh.

[Speaker 2]
I will use a third level spell to cast bestow curse on the assassin. Could they please make a wisdom save?

[Speaker 6]
Fuck.

[Speaker 1]
That was really good. Yeah, I rolled a 19. That's why.

[Speaker 2]
It is very good. Bonus action. Oh, you can't cast two leveled spells.

I'm done.

[Speaker 1]
He did.

[Speaker 5]
Um, all right. So as she's like mumbling her little blessing, she's going to. Ah, yeah.

Yeah, I think I can do that. That's a fair, a fair thing. Okay.

All right. Oh, okay. I think that's that probably hits, right?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
Um, all right. Plus the 4d.

[Speaker 1]
Nice roll.

[Speaker 5]
What was it? What was it? Those two little fuckers did?

[Speaker 1]
It would be a d8. Oh, d8 plus 4 plus a d6.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, a d8 slash. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I got you.

[Speaker 5]
All right. Thank you. The numbers confuse me.

It's my weakness. Um, and then that will be my, uh, my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait. No, it's just supposed to be against this one. It's just supposed to be.

Oh, fuck. Damn it. There's eight.

So that was max. So it should be. I forgot my creature wasn't undead.

Uh, okay. Hestia.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, great.

[Speaker 1]
No, first legendary action.

[Speaker 5]
By the way, if you have to do a saving throw, um, all of you have a d4 to spend.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. It's going to be huge.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't exactly know what blast did.

[Speaker 2]
Really good spell.

[Speaker 5]
D4 can make all the difference.

[Speaker 2]
Shield ducks in front of its mouth again.

[Speaker 1]
All right, now we can test you.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Um, so far she is the only one in here. Well, I don't really want to hurt her, not lethally at least.

Uh, Rana, do you want me to attack her?

[Speaker 2]
We have to.

[Speaker 4]
Fair enough. I will use sacred flame to begin with. Oh, it is a dexterity save.

That's nice to know. Oh, I forgot to target her. Uh, so she has to make a dex save.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, these are all uncooked. That's actually a 10. Never mind.

[Speaker 4]
I am level 8. It is not as good. Um, but I think that is all I can do for now.

Maybe, uh, oh, this is a bonus action. I'm going to do this.

[Speaker 6]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
What up? Um, so I have wings now.

[Speaker 2]
Jealous of the wasp.

[Speaker 4]
And that is my turn. Yes. All righty.

[Speaker 1]
Check out mood. He's over here. It's been his turn.

Been his turn, uh, climbing. Almost spent his turn climbing. Climbing.

Running. And climbing. We come to the top of the round with the nightwalker.

Going to continue flying. He'll just be right at eye level with that door. The assassin's up.

[Speaker 5]
Bastard.

[Speaker 1]
We are actually before that. It's going to use a legendary action to move.

[Speaker 2]
I know I can't opportunity attack it, but Rana would like, swipe at it, and I assume it's like, swarming as like, bugs and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Just turns into bugs and disappears. Reforms next to Edith. Bite attack first.

15 hit Edith.

[Speaker 5]
Save? Do I do a con save or is it a wisdom save?

[Speaker 1]
Con save is what you're thinking of.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Oh boy. Pray for me folks.

10?

[Speaker 1]
10 makes it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh does it?

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
You're still blessed folks.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Are you also blessed?

[Speaker 5]
No, I'm not. No, it's three creatures. Oh no.

Yep.

[Speaker 1]
If you do lose concentration, cast at the second level.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, and then I can do all of us. I think I can- It doesn't say anything about doing it against myself. But yeah, whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, they can roll a d4 or add the number.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you lose 18 hit points, your max is reduced to 5.

[Speaker 5]
Oh god, I have to do extra stuff there.

[Speaker 1]
Your max is reduced by 12.

[Speaker 6]
By 12?

[Speaker 1]
That's a 16 icing to the team. For 11 damage. Then I'll let you roll another concentration check.

[Speaker 5]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
It is Rana's turn.

[Speaker 2]
How much does it- You need to roll a 10 on your con save.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. How much- Well done. I got a nat 20.

Awesome. How much damage did I take? You said 18.

[Speaker 1]
18 and then 11. And your max was reduced by 12.

[Speaker 2]
Does 27 hit? I'd say so. Oh, I didn't add- Sorry, I didn't add my blessed d4 to that.

All right, that summons seven more spirits. I would like to use five of them to try and banish.

[Speaker 6]
Huh? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Does this follow the spell banishment, where it just puts them in like a pocket dimension for a minute?

[Speaker 1]
Pretty much. Ooh, she's gonna have to legendary resist that.

[Speaker 2]
Good. And that uses- So that used five spirits, so I gain two. So I'm only gonna drag two out if that's fine with you, James.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. That's- I believe you.

[Speaker 2]
How'd that get- That should be a fear. Oh, that is my turn. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. You know what? I'm just gonna attempt to bite you.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just gonna have to do my spell first. And then it will be Edith's turn.

[Speaker 6]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I'm going to- Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Does Foundry just not know that it's supposed to get legendary reactions back at the beginning of its turn, or- Sorry?

[Speaker 5]
What'd you say?

[Speaker 1]
I said Foundry doesn't know what- Oh, it didn't recharge them. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I'm low on spells, so I'm going to smack this guy.

[Speaker 2]
If you tell me that he's using a legendary reaction, you can just do the attack rather than ping the ability. Um, I believe you, James. This was at Rana, right?

[Speaker 7]
Shield block, yes! God, fuck.

[Speaker 5]
12, does 12 hit?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 12 does not hit, unfortunately.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, damn. Okay. That is my turn.

Um, no, I won't do that. I would move, but I don't want him to be able to hit me. If you could- somebody could lure it away, that'd be great.

But yeah, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. All right, I'm gonna go to... Hestia!

[Speaker 4]
All right, um...

[Speaker 2]
I didn't diminish her. Oh, we did skip over the wasp.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. Where'd the wasp like to go?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, you wanted me to draw- you wanted something to be drawn away? I can't think of anything better than a wasp.

[Speaker 1]
Giant wasp.

[Speaker 3]
A giant wasp. Massive wasp. That reminds me.

Do you- what am I... Big guy near Edith.

[Speaker 5]
I'm squishy and don't have many spell slots.

[Speaker 2]
Buzz buzz.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a buzz buzz motherfucker. All right, I'm just gonna sting it. Oh yeah, see now.

Aww.

[Speaker 5]
Oh man.

[Speaker 3]
All right, I'm just gonna buzz around it.

[Speaker 1]
You have a plus, uh, it's still not- It's bless. Don't forget your bless.

[Speaker 6]
13?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 13, unfortunately, no.

[Speaker 3]
Can I buzz around it so that it like swings at me?

[Speaker 6]
Sure.

[Speaker 3]
Can I get in its face?

[Speaker 2]
If you move away, it'll take its reaction and then- Oh yeah. Edith's already gone.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I've already gone, so it wouldn't- Okay, well I'm just gonna get in its face then.

[Speaker 5]
Edith, what's- Edith's magic is like, I don't actually think I picked one, but let me check. You know how indecisive I am. It's, um, I think- I think there's an AK-47.

I could- I don't know if this is from, uh, I don't know if Eyes of the Eagle is from something I've done, or if it's just my magic item that I picked. Oh, but that's cool. I didn't know I had that.

Apparently I have really good sight. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I ever really picked one.

It could be the Eyes of the Eagle, though. Why?

[Speaker 1]
I'm just checking to see if you have any more resources.

[Speaker 3]
Um. No. I'm almost done.

I just- it prepared all of the damn spells, so I have to unclick them.

[Speaker 4]
There's a way to auto-do it, but I didn't want to confuse you.

[Speaker 3]
I- yeah, I don't know. I'm almost done now.

[Speaker 5]
Your girl didn't, uh, plan her- It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's all right, it was your first character. I do recommend, like, just take a brief look through discovered items in the items tab, and if you'd like to yank something out of that, that's certainly fine.

[Speaker 5]
Like right now?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, like right this second.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll do that.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Hestia. Steep.

[Speaker 4]
All right, uh, I am going to Foyerbolt. I have a plus four d4, right? Bless is on attack rolls?

Yep, attack roll saves. It's a 16 hit. 16 whiffs.

All right. I'm also gonna move... Don't eat that.

I'm gonna move over here. I'm gonna fly over here. That's my turn.

[Speaker 3]
I can't find Deidre's token.

[Speaker 6]
Well.

[Speaker 1]
Can I describe you? No, I got it. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
It's in the character tokens. It's under D. They're alphabetical.

It's right underneath Diane, I think.

[Speaker 3]
All right, there we are. Hi, you're supposed to be asleep. All right, I've got her as good as I can get her right now.

[Speaker 6]
For real. Here we go.

[Speaker 4]
Here we go.

[Speaker 6]
All right, there you are.

[Speaker 1]
It's in your, uh, it's your thing now.

[Speaker 5]
Would this outer essence shard be useful? Or obtainable at all?

[Speaker 7]
I think it's for a...

[Speaker 1]
I put, so I put an item inside of your...

[Speaker 6]
Oh, did you?

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you. What is it?

[Speaker 3]
Zombie Claw is gonna move up here. Oh, that's...

[Speaker 1]
He said that's eight. What's times four so... All right.

16 D4. I'm not gonna reroll this. All right, so we'll also take that damage.

I know it was a take. So I'm moving 20 feet. The other ones are in front of it.

All right, and how is Deidre looking?

[Speaker 3]
She's good to go.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just gonna have you go after I start hurting these guys.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, my initiative's eight, so it's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, did you lose all your items too?

[Speaker 3]
Technically, I got them back, man. I at least knew that.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yeah, the Staff of the Woodlands was the really important one. Yep, I got it back. I remembered it.

You can go now, if you're prepared.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 1]
You're permitted to not be a giant wasp if you so choose.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I already got out of that.

[Speaker 3]
And then, what is happening?

[Speaker 6]
Nice. Yeah, we'll just do that.

[Speaker 1]
What level are you testing us at?

[Speaker 2]
It says first level.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, first level. That's fine. First level.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, do we have someone who can undo that, maybe? Herbalist?

[Speaker 5]
I'm an Herbalist. I have four... no.

[Speaker 4]
I would just...

[Speaker 5]
it needs to be...

[Speaker 4]
It just needs to be reduced by two.

[Speaker 5]
No, technically three, because if it meets, it beats. I only have 1d8 left.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, then you might want to save it for a critical one.

[Speaker 2]
Save it for a higher level costing.

[Speaker 4]
It's just first level. I mean, it's still going to take half damage, but it just doesn't push. Well, I was thinking you should use a legendary resist on it.

But also, maybe not on a low level.

[Speaker 3]
Let me know if you need it, dear. Only if you want to, dear. All right.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, you can have...

[Speaker 3]
Because it will push up. I mean, the only... yeah, okay.

Oh, wait.

[Speaker 4]
Who are you casting that on?

[Speaker 3]
This guy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
The clot. Behind the door.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no! I thought the door was open. Okay, never mind, then.

Yeah, take your d8 back. I didn't realize the door was... Okay, well, then I'll do it at her, sure.

[Speaker 6]
She's already rolled the save, so... Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Well, she's still going to take half damage. So at least that's something. Take that six thunder damage.

And I think... I think I might...

[Speaker 6]
All right, is that everything?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to cast Shillelagh as a bonus action. Shillelagh.

[Speaker 2]
The vampire attack... Well, the creature attack... Majora's, they step back.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I did move back, so...

[Speaker 1]
It will.

[Speaker 3]
Ouchies.

[Speaker 5]
I think you're still blessed, too.

[Speaker 2]
Blessed doesn't appear, unfortunately.

[Speaker 1]
And that's going to use a legendary action on another bike versus Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Bring it. That one hits, no?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. All right, Nightwalker can't really do anything right now, except float anything.

[Speaker 2]
It's going to open the door and it's going to shoot a laser beam in, fucking kill Rana.

[Speaker 1]
Assassin is going to attempt to grapple Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Grapple? Is it going to hit me, or is it going to contest a check?

[Speaker 1]
It's going to do a contested check.

[Speaker 2]
Acrobatics proficiency, huge.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wow. All right, that just sent a bite instead.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, hit her again. That's so rude.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, my hit point max was reduced from the last one as well, wasn't it? Plus the necrotic, the 3d6.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. And then it's going to use a... End its turn and use a legendary action to move over the heads together.

[Speaker 2]
Can you just put negative 12 in the max HP section? Yes, you can.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know. Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
First one was also 12. Oh, okay, sorry. I have done my health.

[Speaker 1]
You're fine. Edith, I put another one in there for you.

[Speaker 2]
I assume it's my turn after it.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to stab it again.

[Speaker 5]
What is it you're putting in here?

[Speaker 1]
These are hearthwands. They don't cost concentration.

[Speaker 5]
Where are they?

[Speaker 1]
They're inside of your character thread.

[Speaker 4]
In the discord.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Can I please have a charisma save as I try to banish it again?

[Speaker 1]
Hey, man. Is anybody a minstrel?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 4]
I took the worst one for this, the leitrap. You can't reduce anything with the leitraps. Because there's so much other things it does.

[Speaker 2]
Minus action, I'll cast shield of faith and end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
All right. You just gotta restrain somebody with one dice. Nobody's used the wardens this round.

Did you want to add damage to that?

[Speaker 2]
Sure, I'll add an extra... What is it? D8 plus D6 plus 4?

[Speaker 1]
D8 plus 4. It's an extra D6 versus undead.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Ah, they aren't undead. Yeah, we'll take your good roll and not my bad roll.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair.

[Speaker 2]
I did it wrong. We can't use that.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Edith, what do we got?

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm gonna use that new item thing. The stone, the hearthwand of stone. What does erupting earth do?

[Speaker 1]
It's an area damage spell. I love it. 3d12?

[Speaker 5]
3d12? Eh, yeah, that'll get you guys. Eh.

Eh?

[Speaker 6]
What do you mean, eh? You're the one who's not in it.

[Speaker 5]
You don't get an eh. Ooh, two charges. Four charges.

Eight charges.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
So it says four charges of invisibility? Or is that for private sanctum?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, invisibility is... Four charges is invisibility, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And eight charges is greater invisibility.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I don't think invisibility would really help here. Um, but it'll keep Rana alive.

Uh, you guys won't be blessed again, though. Oh, no, because it's not... Is it concentration?

Uh, not when it's cast by the, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Not when it's cast by the wall.

[Speaker 5]
Well then, Rana, you are gonna get some invisibility. Wait, can you get invisibility? Or will that fuck with your halo shit?

[Speaker 2]
If I attack, it's gonna break it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. But it'll, um...

[Speaker 4]
It'll keep you alive.

[Speaker 2]
My AC is 22. I'm fine. Your AC is 22?

Oh, okay, it has to be a little higher.

[Speaker 4]
Just attack it if you can. Um, yeah, I don't think invisibility's gonna help me too much here.

[Speaker 5]
No, but it'll prevent you from getting hit.

[Speaker 2]
Potentially.

[Speaker 4]
Potentially. Yeah, I have a thing I'm gonna try.

[Speaker 5]
So you don't want it?

[Speaker 4]
I don't have much if I can't attack is the problem.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, this would be an invisibility... Yeah, okay. Um, in that case...

[Speaker 1]
Greater invisibility is eight charges.

[Speaker 5]
No, thank you. And stone shape? What does that do?

Stone shape...

[Speaker 6]
It changes shape.

[Speaker 1]
Wow. You can basically manipulate the shape of the stone. Which, everything in here is stone.

[Speaker 4]
Let's give him the critter.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, what's this guy made of?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you could... How would that affect stone shape?

[Speaker 2]
It just turns into spiders and escapes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Then we all scream. Can you stone shape a wall in front of the door of one of the balconies?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You could also stone shape a door or its frame to seal the door shut.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna do that. That's what I'm doing. How many charges is that?

Stone shape or stone wall. Stone shape, stone shape. Stone shape is four charges.

Okay, we'll do that.

[Speaker 4]
Which door do you want to close?

[Speaker 3]
This one.

[Speaker 6]
I was thinking of doing...

[Speaker 1]
If these things get in here, you guys are super fucked. Not even counting the nightwalker.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I've got another... I don't know if I'll get it in my turn.

[Speaker 1]
If Nessie tries to save you guys, Nessie uses a lot of high level spells.

[Speaker 3]
Me?

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying. You know what? Actually, I'm gonna close the one next to me because I'm self-preservation.

I'm closing this one. Like, I was gonna... Because it's probably gonna do me and everybody else.

So...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so this one is gonna be sealed. That's good. All right, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
It is.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Hestia.

[Speaker 4]
But don't. I'm thunderstepping. So I teleport over here.

And it goes kaboom! She has to make a con save. Drink your milk.

Go to bed. No.

[Speaker 3]
That's what she's saying.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
All right, she's at half.

[Speaker 4]
And that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Bonnie versus Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Misses.

[Speaker 1]
Goddammit. All righty.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, Shield of Faith.

[Speaker 1]
Hestia!

[Speaker 4]
From all the way over there?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. Sorry, not Hestia. Okay.

Deidre. I don't know why I said that.

[Speaker 3]
Am I getting hit?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's your turn. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna cast Moonbeam. Where do we want my Moonbeam? I was thinking, pointing at...

[Speaker 2]
Just on it, I think. I think on the weird warp link.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, there's only one critter. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
The door's... That door's still shut. I think we try and kill this guy as quick as possible.

[Speaker 3]
And I'll do it at 4th level.

[Speaker 6]
Nice.

[Speaker 3]
Just to...

[Speaker 1]
Just a zip and move.

[Speaker 2]
Can't roll good for all of it saved. Jolly.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you're crying out loud.

[Speaker 2]
I got half damage. It's still half damage, so... Oh, it'll take the damage on its turn.

[Speaker 3]
Well, there it is. Um...

[Speaker 1]
The first time enters the... Or starts its turn there. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
That's...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it makes a save with disadvantage. Hold on a second. Oh!

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
It's a shape changer.

[Speaker 7]
Oh! Yes!

[Speaker 3]
All right, that's all I could do on this... On this turn.

[Speaker 4]
All right. That was a pretty good turn. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'll say so. Frost Giant Zombie is going to, um... Start hurling rocks.

[Speaker 3]
Where is this zombie? Too close to us. Oh!

I had to zoom out.

[Speaker 6]
Yikes. Pixie.

[Speaker 1]
All right, this thing is going to make... A... Two slam attacks.

How do you miss a door? Great question. Just got a bunch of...

Crumpled... This thing just got hit by a rock. Two damage.

Uh, I think probably once I... But a hundred damage will go to support. It'll, uh...

Withdraw it. It's dwarven craftsmanship and it's just been magically sealed. So I think a hundred damage will probably work.

[Speaker 6]
And then who knows? Why?

[Speaker 1]
This one cannot attack. This one is going to attempt to, um... Oh, it's gonna...

Push through the door. It's got 44 damage. He stopped that.

So this one is going to...

[Speaker 2]
Surely they go for the closest person, right? Probably, yeah. Into the sickening light.

[Speaker 3]
And they're whispering my moonbeam.

[Speaker 7]
I don't...

[Speaker 3]
It probably doesn't work, but...

[Speaker 2]
If they step into it, it hits them.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, definitely. They are... They have one square in there.

One little tiny... Bittle bit.

[Speaker 6]
Fools!

[Speaker 1]
Don't do it so hot. All right. All right, attack.

Advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Am I bloodied? How much HP do I have? That's my reduction.

I don't think I am. Also into the moonbeam. My suggestion, James, is to go up to moonbeam and right-click it to pop it out.

So you can just keep that. For when you need to do the save, you can double-click on the top of it to minimize it.

[Speaker 1]
I've just been applying the damage. He's thinking about making a... He's thinking about...

[Speaker 6]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 3]
What is that?

[Speaker 1]
All right, full strength zombie. It's my plan. He did just kind of...

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
A broken rock into the door.

[Speaker 3]
That was terrifying, Otter.

[Speaker 1]
Can't really do much else besides that. All right, zombie claw. Hey, it's a Nightwalker.

Ooh, what does he get to... All right, he can't fit into this space without going into spike growth. He can fly, can't he?

He can fly, but he's huge is the problem.

[Speaker 2]
All right, he has to... He physically...

[Speaker 1]
That's okay. He'll be just fine. A mere eighth of his health.

Who is here? He's gonna try to... Deidre?

[Speaker 3]
No. No, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
That's a melee weapon attack. Finger of doom!

[Speaker 7]
Oh, no. That's not good.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. Oh, you just have to make a straight-up wisdom save.

[Speaker 5]
And you do have a d4, I think it was, to add to that.

[Speaker 3]
I have a what? A d4? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Isn't there something with Death Ward? No, it's not Death Ward. Isn't it?

[Speaker 2]
Death Ward just starts you dying once.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. What's that one that I'm thinking of? Oh, the d4 did roll.

Mm-hmm. What were you thinking of?

[Speaker 1]
Nessie, what's your secondary class?

[Speaker 3]
Prospector. Oh, I forgot to put that in.

[Speaker 2]
Eat a rock. That's not bad.

[Speaker 6]
Pretty low.

[Speaker 1]
All right, you gotta make a dc12 con save.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, hang on. Do I also get the d4 with that? Yay.

Any saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. If you get paralyzed, I think you lose concentration.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, and it was 12, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, dc's 12.

[Speaker 3]
Yay. I don't think paralyzed does it.

[Speaker 2]
Paralyzed makes you incapacitated and you lose concentration on a spell if you're incapacitated. Or if you die. That's in the spell casting spot, it's not in the actual condition.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so currently Idri is paralyzed.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Did I get my spell?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 2]
You lose concentration when you're paralyzed.

[Speaker 3]
What was the constitution saving throw for then?

[Speaker 6]
Unnecessal.

[Speaker 1]
All right, the assassin's gonna attack Rana twice.

[Speaker 4]
Miss. Miss. A miss and a very miss.

[Speaker 1]
Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Um, all right, I'm gonna move. Just double checking I can't cheese this. The spirits can banish a creature between five of them.

I assume that's a single creature.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 2]
Can the spirits move through walls?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, as long as they're within 60 feet of you.

[Speaker 2]
I think they're fine to get around.

[Speaker 1]
You have to move them to a point you can see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, can I just put...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna put like three on that side then and two on the other and try and banish the nightwalker. Oh, ping it. I should have just done that instead of moving.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know why I didn't just do the save.

[Speaker 6]
Oof.

[Speaker 2]
Now is that like I'm concentrating on banishment?

[Speaker 1]
As per the spell, yes. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Because, um, that's not good.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a bless on?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, shield of faith. I have bless. Shield of faith goes.

I mean, suck.

[Speaker 4]
Doesn't banishment, if it's not from this plane, just like forever?

[Speaker 2]
It's the last for the minute. I need to concentrate for the minute. That's not me casting a spell.

That's a spirit effect.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, you get some effects.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's everyone.

[Speaker 4]
I think everyone's pretty banged up. That's been hit at least. All right.

[Speaker 2]
You can hit us all with that. Uh, it's an extra d8 as well. Add that in.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, that puts me back up to full so I can get... Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then Edith is up next.

[Speaker 5]
Well, they're in a pretty concentrated area so I think it's safe to do the...

[Speaker 2]
Ken, have you got your channel divinity turned on dead?

[Speaker 5]
I do.

[Speaker 2]
Use it.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not speaking of my channel divinity. I completely forgot about my channel divinity. Wow.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, James, I have a question quickly. What sort of corpses are these clods made out of? Is it dwarfish or is it, um, something else?

Just an assortment. These corpses seem to be mostly human. Uh.

Well, the monstrosity doesn't have to make a save but the clods do. Can the clods through the door here, Edith?

[Speaker 5]
What about them?

[Speaker 1]
So, there's no prohibition against them having full cover and I felt like the last time this was asked of me, it was four years ago. It was the last time I ran a campaign IRL and, uh, I feel like I got it wrong. Oh, god damn it.

It doesn't give me a wisdom. All right. Fine.

[Speaker 2]
The feature specifies if they can see or hear you.

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck? Is that, what's your safety seed?

[Speaker 5]
15.

[Speaker 2]
Don't attack that one.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He's got 18 points. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
And that is my turn. I will be right back though.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, they're gonna move in the spike growth and take damage.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody should hit some of the, uh, clods. Also...

[Speaker 2]
You want the wardens to change their order? Yes, please drop... Done.

Drop concentration on the spikes, thank you. Serana's beating at the, um, monster with her shield.

[Speaker 1]
Brings us to Hestia.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, hang on. I gotta redo my entire turn.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, since we can't hit that guy, I can't do the thing I was gonna do. So I gotta re-figure it out. Okay, I need to un...

I need this to be a brighter color. This green sucks.

[Speaker 2]
Only one of them failed. So if you just want to...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but I gotta figure out if I can put it... Because I have to be able to see the spot. Does that miss it?

I think that missed it just barely. Okay. I'm putting it there.

I'm using Sickening Radiance. It is right there. They have to make con saves.

[Speaker 1]
That thing is almost dead. Okay. This one takes...

[Speaker 4]
And I don't know if zombies can take exhaustion, but apparently it takes exhaustion. Does that do anything to enemies?

[Speaker 2]
I think zombies have a condition immunity to exhaustion. I bet it does do things to enemies. It's the same as people.

[Speaker 4]
I didn't know that. I don't think I've ever used exhaustion in a D&D campaign.

[Speaker 2]
It's not very common in abilities and things.

[Speaker 4]
Victory.

[Speaker 1]
It has to do with anything.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think that's it.

[Speaker 2]
When does the paralysis end?

[Speaker 4]
I mean, it's not on this plane anymore.

[Speaker 2]
Until the end of the Nightwalker's next turn.

[Speaker 1]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
There's no extra save. It's just a skip turn, unfortunately.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. One of the Wardens is going to come up and cast Lesser Restoration.

[Speaker 2]
Nice, that's good.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Does Deidre get that turn?

[Speaker 1]
Two level two spells.

[Speaker 2]
Does Deidre get to act on her turn still? Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
That's why these guys are here. They are backups for things that you guys either don't bring or have to focus on other...

[Speaker 3]
You want me to do another Moonbeam?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, if you can hit both of them with the Moonbeam, that would be ideal.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
We know that the girl has... The Spiderwoman has disadvantage on the save, so it's really good.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I take it fourth level?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So both the Claw and the Beautiful.

[Speaker 3]
Let me get rid of the first one. There we go. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
And the Zombie Claw. It might die anyway. Oh, it's dead.

[Speaker 2]
Does Sickening Radiance damage each turn?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, it does.

[Speaker 1]
It's a new spell.

[Speaker 4]
It does, and it also goes around corners, so that thing's still probably going to end up getting hit by it anyway.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Sickening Radiance is also the start of turn. Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Already?

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Frost Giant and Zombie. Going to continue throwing rocks.

[Speaker 2]
They take damage. Oh no, they dropped it. Yes, thank fuck.

That would have been heartbreaking.

[Speaker 1]
Who am I? What do you take me for?

[Speaker 2]
You said they broke the door.

[Speaker 1]
Nope. Gotta make it to 100.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. They hadn't made it to 100 yet.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. This thing is going to... I don't think it necessarily takes a safe route.

I'm just going to run straight through. It's going to take damage.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead and take damage and clear it.

[Speaker 6]
Well, it's going to make it...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's going to take the damage regardless.

[Speaker 2]
Take off. And... Try and add one that steps to like here.

[Speaker 1]
Well, here's the thing is it's in the middle of moving, so I assume there's like some kind of momentum that it... Go ahead and roll your dead... Wait.

How many dice is that? I cannot survive.

[Speaker 4]
Sick. It just runs through and collapses as it's moving.

[Speaker 1]
Basically. No, it like limps as it's in the sickening radiance. You see like spits start going everywhere.

And the little bit that's left that's moving just kind of impales itself on the... Quite gross. Plus, we're in zombies.

He's going to start climbing. Nightwalker is still banished. We got the assassin.

[Speaker 2]
The nightwalker would get to recharge his finger of doom potentially.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I should check that.

[Speaker 2]
You're welcome.

[Speaker 5]
It's the kid who's like, Hey, you forgot to check our homework. Why?

[Speaker 3]
Why would you say that?

[Speaker 1]
The assassin needs to make a conceded disadvantage.

[Speaker 3]
Me?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, the assassin also... Oh, thank goodness. The assassin did that one.

[Speaker 4]
Yes. She also has to make another one, because she's in the sickening radiance. Oh shit, all right.

That one's not a disadvantage though.

[Speaker 2]
Um, actually... You already rolled the attack before, because it's at the start of a turn. When you cast the spell...

When I rolled before, it would have taken that now.

[Speaker 3]
I want her to like, disintegrate into trouble love, very painfully.

[Speaker 4]
I thought you liked her.

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 4]
That's the school girl. Oh shit.

[Speaker 3]
Um, Mimosa loves her. This is not Mimosa. Deidre has no attachment.

This fucking sucks. I cannot tell you. This is a little girl.

[Speaker 1]
You just watch, uh... You watch all the...

[Speaker 6]
All the way...

[Speaker 1]
Bugs fade off, a faintly small humanoid form, and just kind of float up, like it's getting a UFO beamed into the sky. They just kind of like, slowly start floating... All the dead bugs just start slowly floating upwards.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
In the beam. Uh, and you see these little bolts of lightning just kind of phase in through the ceiling and start, uh, forcing the corpse to twitch.

[Speaker 5]
This is round two? What's going on?

[Speaker 1]
This is round, uh, five. And we're on Rana.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, the little girl's corpse is twitching?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, like, I mean, like, is she coming back?

[Speaker 3]
Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I think Rana is the only one here who saw... Wait, no, Edith, I think, also saw this. I think Edith...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, no, it might have been...

[Speaker 5]
Why would someone else... Actually, no, it was... It was Edith.

She saw the, um... It was, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like you two would know that Mimosa is very attached to her and doesn't really want her.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, if... Definitely, if I know that, I would...

[Speaker 3]
Because she would have said it. She would have been vocal about it. Yeah.

Deidre doesn't know anything about this girl and I'm really mad about it.

[Speaker 2]
Can I see this guy, James? The... Who is this girl?

[Speaker 3]
Like, why do you care so much about her?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, it's fine, um...

[Speaker 3]
I've had interactions that just made Mimosa attached to her. Okay, um... Yeah.

She also has the little girl's school stuff.

[Speaker 5]
Is she an undead, though?

[Speaker 6]
No. All right, Edith.

[Speaker 3]
No? Okay. There's Paladin!

A glorified golem.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, at the end of Rana's turn, a nice little spectral orb begins glowing again. You see... I'm sorry, not the...

[Speaker 3]
Imagine he comes in to do a progress report and just sees all this shit.

[Speaker 1]
Professor Rostal. They're coming. Rather pointed man.

And Paladin again is like, Rana, Rana, you must... Gather your friends, come back. Come back now.

[Speaker 2]
We can get to the circle in a couple seconds. Can you bring us?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, I'm... Yes.

[Speaker 2]
All right, Rana's gonna dodge on the circle. Get over here now!

[Speaker 3]
Okay, in one moment we have a turn order.

[Speaker 2]
What about...

[Speaker 5]
Now I'm going to, um... Oh, the little girl, little girl. What about the little girl?

What do I need to do? I don't know!

[Speaker 4]
I don't think there's anything that we can do.

[Speaker 5]
Could I bring her corpse back?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, bring her corpse back. I'll grab her corpse, I'll pick her up, and I'll bring her back.

[Speaker 5]
And then most of them will want to see this. Well, won't want to, but it would be necessary. Nobody wants to see anything like that.

[Speaker 1]
Anything, uh, anything else you do?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think so. Well, actually...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, because I am carrying the girl. But... No, because I'm...

You guys are blessed. Yeah, no, just continue on.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Estia, what have you got for us?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, well, I guess I'm just walking over. Plump.

[Speaker 1]
All right, and then Deidre.

[Speaker 3]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Notice the wardens will join you.

[Speaker 2]
It'd be pretty sad if they didn't. Not letting them do a girl will hold them off sort of thing. They're coming with us.

[Speaker 1]
No, they're fine. They're fine to come with. They don't want to walk back to the keep, I think, is their biggest problem right now.

[Speaker 3]
I don't blame them.

[Speaker 6]
Man, I want coffee.

[Speaker 2]
I managed to not walk home.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, don't say that. I do too. I'm just super sensitive to coffee, so there'd be no coming back from that.

[Speaker 5]
I have a caffeine addiction.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so y'all are returned to Gravathul.

[Speaker 3]
It's a shame we didn't see those warning signs.

[Speaker 1]
Professor Rustall is sitting in front of you. There are a number of other professors around you, some of whom you recognize as medical staff. Some others are curse specialists.

There is Professor Torbois is in chains.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. You're just going to point at him and be like.

[Speaker 1]
The professors are actually getting ready to put a tadpole in.

[Speaker 3]
What does that mean?

[Speaker 2]
Can I roll a history? Can I roll history for the school? Is that a standard punishment?

[Speaker 5]
It is not. I, you, you do, you my guy.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Rana probably doesn't recognize him. This one is not in the handbook.

[Speaker 2]
I need to get my Google Doc open so I can write this down.

[Speaker 1]
You should, hey, hey, take notes. Um. Be here.

Okay, so you guys are, you guys are returned to Gravathul. Professor Rustall is sitting in front of you like, ah, is everything, is everyone okay? Is everybody alive?

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, we're made of tough stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Where is, uh, who's, who's that? Oh, that, uh, that looks familiar, actually. At this point, the corpse is getting progressively more like blackened, and every time it's getting struck by lightning, which everybody jumps back when they see it.

They're like, oh.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, uh, the little girl that I'm carrying? Mm-hmm. Ah.

She was important, I, I think, to someone I know. I, I thought she might need to know.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see here. Um. You're in a room that has a pedestal on it, uh.

Professor Rustall quickly takes the corpse and casts, uh, not to, not to pose that, a gentler pose. Revivify. You see a little, what's up?

[Speaker 5]
Can I revivify this bitch?

[Speaker 1]
Mm, that's for humanoids.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, damn, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Right now, she's frozen in time with a little lightning bolt sitting just above her chest.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, thank you, dear.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, okay, um. First things first, where's the vase? None of you are dead?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, you wanted us to bring the vase.

[Speaker 1]
I just need to know where the vase is. No, that's not the issue. Um, upstairs in that teleportation.

Okay, you don't have it. Oh, thank the gods.

[Speaker 3]
No, we left him sitting there, bored.

[Speaker 1]
All right, that's okay.

[Speaker 3]
He is out, though, if that means anything.

[Speaker 1]
That's, um, first things could have happened.

[Speaker 2]
How did this- It sounds like he was still bound to the vase.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, how do you know this, uh, man? This, yeah, man. What was your deal with him?

[Speaker 1]
We're preparing to interrogate, uh, Mr. Torvald further, but Professor Torvald further, former Professor Torvald, but it seems as though he was being blackmailed.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that'll ball and chain. You haven't been blackmailed.

[Speaker 1]
He was blackmailed specifically, as far as we know, to send a bunch of, uh, potent sacrifices to the vase.

[Speaker 5]
That was, uh, us? I presume? What?

We're still here.

[Speaker 2]
I also- Fortunately, none of us dealt with the vase. We were smart enough not to bargain with the fiend.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I wouldn't have cared if you went either way, though it would have been a shame to lose your newfound power for, uh, Mr. Cherry, was it? Yes, I think so. Uh-huh.

[Speaker 3]
Newfound power?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, she does have a halo above her. It wasn't always there, if I recall.

[Speaker 2]
No, that was after I read the Book of Exalted Deeds.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Professor- Like, uh, going back to grey. Yes?

[Speaker 2]
There are several soulfires burning down near that dwarven- in the dwarven hold. That's really bad.

[Speaker 1]
Uh-huh. Uh, he turns to Professor Torgwald and says, you didn't think to tell us this? And his voice echoes.

He's not shadowed, shouting, or anything like that.

[Speaker 3]
Just, his voice echoes throughout the entire- Man, when you're beyond pissed and your voice just echoes around everything.

[Speaker 5]
Pretty hot.

[Speaker 1]
Who's this guy talking to?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I can't deny it.

[Speaker 1]
I'll be fair to you.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know who I am!

[Speaker 1]
Talking to the Hellmaster, which is the dwarf who had the guy's approach initially, uh, soulfires are very difficult to deal with. Have you- Please tell me that you've learned something. We're gonna dive into his head as quickly as possible.

[Speaker 4]
Does the name Old Scratch ring any bells?

[Speaker 7]
The name?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Supposedly, that's what this necromancer went by.

[Speaker 7]
All right, give me a moment.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to go off and cast Legend Lore.

[Speaker 3]
How white is the sheet do we think he's gonna be?

[Speaker 4]
Was that the vampire guy? Probably pretty white.

[Speaker 1]
He's a vampire? He's pretty, um... He's pretty pale.

I think he's a vampire.

[Speaker 5]
He's a vampire? What are we talking about?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, he's a vampire! I think he's, like, Irish girl sunbathing away.

[Speaker 1]
It comes back as, like, uh, this creature... This creature is either from, based on the riddle I was given, is either from an alternate version of this world, or an alternate history of this world that was conjured up. Or he was originally not human.

He was reincarnated as such. Necromancer, he's been here since close to the beginning of the world. This one.

But that's just the name. It doesn't give me much useful information. He said there were soul fliers, anything else, any details?

Precious.

[Speaker 4]
Well, the rakshasa, uh, the, um... Mr. Cheery seemed to think that he didn't have much luck with souls.

[Speaker 3]
He didn't exactly seem to be human. He didn't have much luck with souls. What do you mean?

[Speaker 4]
Apparently Old Scratch can't raise them. He has issues with them, something like that.

[Speaker 3]
No, he can't control them. He can raise them.

[Speaker 4]
He can't control them.

[Speaker 3]
That's right. He just can't control it. Incompetent ass.

That's curious.

[Speaker 1]
That's really curious.

[Speaker 7]
Curious and wise, curious.

[Speaker 1]
It would come into question. Okay, so raising... I'm a professor called Dunic Sorcery.

I can raise spirits quite easily, and it's the more advanced version of raising spirits. Raising ghosts, creating ghosts, generally speaking, dominating them is... The more reliable methods do take some time to acquire, but you're looking at a mere 100 years to master it, truly.

Or at least gain some passing expertise. Someone who was around for the secrets of the old world would surely have plenty of time to engage with this. All this brings me to conclude that there's something about him that's paired poorly with spirits.

Like he's been rejected by some higher power.

[Speaker 5]
Any idea who this higher power could be? Hold on, what is my god stance on the undead?

[Speaker 1]
On the undead? So the Ashen Coil is very big on making sure that people are returned to their final resting place.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, okay, that's what I thought.

[Speaker 1]
That's why the City of the Dead is an affront to the Ashen Coil, because the City of the Dead houses wraiths. If a professor begins telling you about Tirna Marb, there's a place that's basically a wound on the World Tree. It's the cursing of the World Tree, if you will.

It's called the Tirna Marb, it's the City of the Dead. We usually only tell the graduates about it, or basically the alumni, the special classes that we discuss such matters. And only the ones that we've come to trust implicitly.

[Speaker 5]
Why is that?

[Speaker 1]
Because the City of the Dead can ask for a lot of power, and I mean a lot of power. The strength those wraiths hold can- There's just so much you can do with that gaping pit that wraiths call a soul. If you really tap into just one-tenth of that city's population, you could overrun a planet in minutes.

[Speaker 6]
In that... mile.

[Speaker 1]
I doubt that he's going to be- If he's been rejected, he's been- I suggest- I imagine he's been first in some capacity.

[Speaker 5]
Who do you think holds such power?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the current leader of the City of the Dead is named Oishan, or Oishan.

[Speaker 5]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
Any of the past emperors of the City of the Dead could manage that feat.

[Speaker 2]
Mr. Cherry mentioned that the necromancer- Only one who's still around could undo it. Go ahead. He mentioned that the necromancer wanted to strike a deal with him to have more power over spirits.

He also had been making deals with other beings. I assume also infernal in nature due to the presence of the soulfires?

[Speaker 1]
Potentially. Most of them would be infernal, I guess. There's a few exceptions.

Oishan is one of them. Any of the guildmasters of the City of the Dead would also be. Ah.

Canthasia. Canthasia, she's the last of the Underknight Court, or the sole survivor of the Underknight Court, the queen of the Gloaming Court, the only noble- the only major noble in her house. Uh, she's a- she's a fae that rules over the Underworld, or at least in this region.

She's, uh, somewhat- how do I put this? She's awfully keen on wraithbinding. Do we know that that's what that- At this point, a gunshot rings out.

Professor Torbois has been, uh, killed. Uh, this is after the tadpole has been inserted. Can I- Is someone digging around with pliers to get into his, uh, get into his skull and pull the tadpole out now?

Go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
Like a nature check? Yeah. Oh, hang on.

That's not what it is. I think I wasted my intelligence, got messed with. About the fish, the tadpole.

[Speaker 1]
About the tadpole, uh, definitely unnatural. You're druids. You're a circle of the land, right?

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so- Forest circle. Forest. All right, you would have been specifically familiar with aberrations.

There's some druid- druidic traditions or higher circles that tend to focus on exterminating certain beings that they find abhorred to nature, and aberrations are one of them. One of the most popular in certain places of the world. So you would recognize a telmarin, or- which is the- this world's word for eliphib, tadpole.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
In other words, we're going to use the- speak with that on the tadpole, well, modified version. Any questions that you have?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I don't know. What was he being blackmailed for?

[Speaker 4]
I think that's a question they're already asking.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well then I don't know. I thought I was being clever. Don't worry, girl, I have no idea either.

[Speaker 2]
Professor, hypothetically, if someone was to use a conduit like my dagger for summoning spirits with their own life force, what would happen?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, uh, oh, well, no, we offer you- I owe you some explanation, sure. Let me put this. Uh, using your own life force for it?

It's awfully potent.

[Speaker 2]
I stabbed myself to banish a nightwalker.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Interesting. Uh, let me know if you end up having any nightmares.

Because I think it could happen is you could turn into- well, you could be infected by a form of vampirism like myself.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, ah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you'd never need to sleep.

[Speaker 1]
You might find yourself slipping into the City of the Dead, at least for short periods of time, or potentially slipping into it.

[Speaker 2]
That would be convenient for study, but I think that would conflict with my halo.

[Speaker 1]
Slipping into the City of the Dead? I think you'd probably fare quite well there.

[Speaker 2]
Would my powers remain if I became a vampire? Does becoming a vampire make you inherent?

[Speaker 1]
I wouldn't say that. Generally speaking, yes. Look everyone, there's still a lot of the old me in here, but it's a change of personality.

I see.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I will keep you updated. That is good to know I won't do that again.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Speaking of slipping, I just can't- He's chasing- This is O. Are there any other details that you could describe?

Because if he's chasing the power I think he is, I don't know why he's here.

[Speaker 3]
Well, he was a little antsy when I mentioned Moonbeam.

[Speaker 4]
I would love to get my Moonbeam on him. Well, that was Cheery.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, you're talking about Mr. Cheery.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, Scratch.

[Speaker 1]
Tell me more about Mr. Cheery. He's normally a simple peddler of coin and, I mean, quite frankly, normally he'd be something of an asset to this school. If you went out hunting undead, you could offer a little bit of blood and get some weapons or money in return.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that's what he would like you to think, as Torana pointed out.

[Speaker 1]
No, I have a book on this creature, believe me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so you know that he's not quite human? Right. What is he exactly?

[Speaker 1]
I believe he's of the Rings of Hadamir. The Hells, as they're called to the peasant folk. I believe he's from the Sixth Ring.

Either that or he's one of the first four that were destroyed.

[Speaker 3]
What does that mean? What is he?

[Speaker 1]
So the Rings of Hadamir encapsulate the Lower Plains. They sort of cork it, if you will. They're like a lid to the rest of the Lower Plains.

They're where the devils come from, where they live. They go about catching souls as much as they can before they sink into the East and some of the other planes that orbit around it. Very long time ago, four of these rings were destroyed, and they're thought to have older magics that are not...

and bargaining powers that were not made available to most of us, or at least not since.

[Speaker 3]
So he's a... you know, he's a devil. Sort of, yes.

Do you know what kind?

[Speaker 1]
Maybe. Probably a duke or an archduke.

[Speaker 3]
I'd like to get my moonbeam on him. Well, he was supposed to help. Old scratch.

I remembered it, yay. Right.

[Speaker 1]
But what was Cherry getting in return?

[Speaker 3]
Did we ask that?

[Speaker 5]
He needed power to help... Oh, what was it? I feel like we did.

We did ask, I think. He needed power to help with the dead or something?

[Speaker 3]
Well, the old scratch needed more power to help control the dead. But what did... What's his face?

Get out of it.

[Speaker 4]
Mr. Cherry.

[Speaker 3]
Mr. Cherry. Oh, we didn't ask that.

[Speaker 2]
From us, he wanted magic to help his friends in his plight against...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that one lady. Started with a T.

[Speaker 2]
She was the one that used to be... What's the name of those? Look.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, it starts with a T. Thalassia? No.

Yeah. Theresea. Theresea.

[Speaker 1]
Theresea, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We got there in the end.

[Speaker 1]
This is a twisted way.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he was really focused on that we would be helping him stop her somehow, which was in our benefit.

[Speaker 1]
I have a thought. If he's aligned with... Did he say anything about witches?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, but I recognized him, and I recognize the signs that he's possibly working for some.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I believe it. Definitely believe it. He's working with...

[Speaker 3]
Aren't scholars just so cute? Look at him work.

[Speaker 1]
I'm... Okay, so my suspicion is just that you're gonna have to research this, but my suspicion...

[Speaker 3]
I have a 19 intelligence, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
Nice.

[Speaker 3]
Ain't no minus one over here.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. If the other witches are competing, I suspect they're... Most of them are going to try draining Theresea first before going after their allies.

[Speaker 3]
Do you say training or draining?

[Speaker 1]
Draining.

[Speaker 3]
Ew.

[Speaker 1]
Which means Theresea needs power. I only know a few ways that she could get it. All of them are worrisome.

[Speaker 3]
And that's what this research is going to be for?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Yes. What do you...

What do all of you know about the comet? Nothing.

[Speaker 3]
I just got here for...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm tired of everything. I just got here.

[Speaker 5]
Mimosa knows, though. Therese knows.

[Speaker 1]
Confirm with your colleagues on the subject.

[Speaker 3]
No colleagues. I don't have any. But sure.

[Speaker 5]
I suppose I could ask a few people at the temple. And some other friends.

[Speaker 1]
Best that we do. So, I'll leave you with the last of my thoughts here. Is that the undead are notoriously...

The undead are notoriously immune to the mind-altering effects of aberrations.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Undead don't have nightmares.

[Speaker 4]
They even dream.

[Speaker 1]
They're awfully difficult to find control. I appreciate this. We're going to be taking care of this necromancer issue soon.

I don't care what his intentions are. Will you be ready to go again? Go at him again in perhaps a month or so?

A month or two? Absolutely.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I think we got a good taste of what is in there and what we need to work on.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. In Ilfer, we got one of his lieutenants. We're going to post a bounty for one of the...

for some of the others and see if we can get anything out of it. In fact, I think...

[Speaker 6]
That sounds good.

[Speaker 1]
Some of your associates are heading into the territory of one of the others right now. If we have two, we'll be able to force his hand at the very least.

[Speaker 3]
Will you tell us what you learned from...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. We're about to do it now.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Might as well. Do you have any questions?

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any questions?

[Speaker 1]
I know. I'm going to start off by with what he was being blackmailed for.

[Speaker 3]
And who was blackmailing him?

[Speaker 1]
Well, no. We know who was blackmailed.

[Speaker 3]
I know. Who was blackmailing him?

[Speaker 1]
Just in case. I wonder who he started with. It was Old Scratch.

Old Scratch was blackmailing the professor to bring a sacrifice, a suitable one for Mr. Cherry.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I suppose the next questions would be, did he know any of Old Scratch's plan? And I suppose anything about the little girl? Or this girl.

[Speaker 1]
I think those are both good. I'm just going to start off with what was Old Scratch blackmailing you for? He says, Threatened to sever my wife.

She was wreath-bound. He said with the connection she would perish forever. I'd have no chance of recovering her.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's unfortunate.

[Speaker 1]
Otterstar, did you just log in under your referee account?

[Speaker 4]
I had logged in to help with Nessie and I just opened my- Oh, that's why.

[Speaker 1]
I was just checking because I was worried about, you know.

[Speaker 4]
Well, he doesn't have that password.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I figured.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have a limit on these questions?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, five.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, if we can't think of anything, I suppose figuring out where his wife is so we can- We already know where his wife is.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. We already know where his wife is. His wife nearly killed us all.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. She was the woman with the wraith in the room.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, okay. Well, now they can be together. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I should note, he's actually casting this on the- I can stop doing the raspy voice. He's casting this on the tadpole, not the- Ah.

[Speaker 3]
It's been a while since I've seen these creatures in action.

[Speaker 1]
It's a little bit easier to get information out of these than the- They've been modified as such.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
They just give you all the information other than complaining about how you were the one who killed them.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, and the defiance and the whining. It's really the whining.

[Speaker 5]
Incessant whining.

[Speaker 3]
The incessant whining, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Does it know what Old Scratch is planning?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. What is Old Scratch planning? Good question.

Who's wraiths siphons this year to attack the comet? A dead world will pose a higher power.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. I'm gonna look at the other people. Do we know of any higher power?

[Speaker 7]
Lots of them.

[Speaker 4]
That would be specific to this? Does it have to be?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 4]
He wanted to rival a god.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm. What a fool.

[Speaker 1]
Foolish and ambitious, but doesn't count for much. Of course, if he succeeds, we're all going to be in trouble. I don't care who.

[Speaker 7]
We'll have a terrible time.

[Speaker 1]
Who?

[Speaker 3]
What next?

[Speaker 1]
What next?

[Speaker 3]
The girl?

[Speaker 1]
The girl, yes. What do you know of the girl? Twisted experiment.

Immigrating. Infiltration. More than a few leaders in Poland.

[Speaker 5]
Um, definitely eventually relay this to Mimosa, by the way. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, all this information can and probably should be shared with the rest of the group.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Especially if any of you are taking notes. Maybe you have a plot board of, like, insane threats.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have two questions left?

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Has anybody been taking down notes?

[Speaker 6]
I'm so bad at taking notes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I've been taking notes.

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying to get better, but I have such bad ADS.

[Speaker 1]
No, I do, too. I totally understand. If anybody wants access to these sessions, by the way, if you want to listen back to them or whatever, I'm uploading them all to a Google Drive.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Oh, cool. Oh, hey, Nessie and I used to do that shit.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we did, and I got bored once editing our- one of our- I, uh, I know somebody who's working on making a Discord bot that transcribes everything that is said, um, specifically for D&D. I was helping out the other day.

[Speaker 1]
That sounds awesome.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I mean, it's still in baby's pages, but, uh, yeah, yeah. I'll definitely link you whenever it's up. That is amazing.

[Speaker 2]
See the transcription of me diverting the session on a 10-minute talk about pronouns.

[Speaker 4]
Do you have any other questions? I'm so bad with questions, man.

[Speaker 5]
How many questions do we have left? Two. Uh, I mean, we could blow the last two.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, are there any other, um, people being blackmailed at this school?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, good one. She said just blackmails in general.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's kind of the problem, is you say it in a way that you're- It's all good. Uh, Professor Sebastians raises up for a moment. As he's pointed out, Sebastians.

Sebastian is being blackmailed by the Eyeless Cult.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, heard their name before, I think. Well, maybe Edith hasn't. Our last question should be who's- I guess who the Eyeless Cult is, right?

[Speaker 3]
Have we heard of the Eyeless Cult?

[Speaker 1]
You have. Um, how much of you have heard of the Eyeless Cult, actually?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it does sound familiar.

[Speaker 1]
You've got the hangman's nail.

[Speaker 3]
Me! And Mimosa does. It's in her purse, remember?

Goddamn it, you should brought Mimosa. I mean, Mimosa's busy with her own quest. Right, right.

She's on her own journey. It is unfortunate. And no one here knows that she has that- Oh, I know Rana would, right?

Is she commissioned? That was Maya.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, Maya. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 1]
You guys can all reconfer about this information and stuff like that very easily.

[Speaker 5]
I like to think that Mimosa and Edith have tea frequently.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, they absolutely do. They use it to, like, tap down the napkin so the wind doesn't blow it. Actually, I don't know how big it is.

Probably uses it as a doorstop.

[Speaker 1]
It'd be, um... That's one of those examples where that might- that item might have to get passed on. Everybody have anything for the look?

Oh, there we go. Now he's gonna ask, um... I think he's gonna ask what Professor Sebastian is being blackmailed to do.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's fine. We can't think of anything. That's a good use.

[Speaker 1]
Sebastian has found false information about the location of a dead god in search of a hierarchical black ark sitting beneath Linwood Isle.

[Speaker 6]
Linwood Isle?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, isn't that our bar's places?

[Speaker 5]
We reached there and the different characters, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm there with my- with my grungy- Monk's there! Yeah, our monks are there. What's- and- and what did he say was under there?

[Speaker 6]
An old- Black ark. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are familiar with the White Ark of Bronloch.

[Speaker 6]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Large vaguely triangular ship with a space for, you know, something approximating a runway, though the characters themselves wouldn't know that. Would not be aware of a runway, I should say.

[Speaker 3]
You distracted me. All right, so the White Ark is a ship, so we can assume the Black Ark is also a ship.

[Speaker 2]
It's the White Ark of the ship that had the- well, has the hidden treasure. We took that across the lake, didn't we? It's actually from the world below.

Is it that one?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, right now it's not in the world below, no.

[Speaker 2]
But it's from the world below.

[Speaker 1]
It's from the world below, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm thinking of the right ship.

[Speaker 1]
You are.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so that's a former sister ship, even if it's, like, opposite. So they want- whoever's blackmailing them wants the ship.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, could you say that again?

[Speaker 3]
Whoever's blackmailing them wants the ship, is that correct?

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Well, do we find this ship and burn it down? Or do we just find this ship and claim it?

[Speaker 1]
Sebastian's feeding them fake information about a dead god so that they go and find the ship for him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Which Professor Rustal right now is like, oh, how's he doing, Sebastian?

[Speaker 3]
So he's not going to get fed a tadpole?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, of course not. No, I think that's pretty clever. If Turquois had been a little bit more clever himself, he might have avoided something like this.

[Speaker 6]
Perhaps.

[Speaker 1]
So, if you guys want, during your downtime actions, if you want anything put on a conspiracy board, we could probably do that. Oh, I feel like my link got deleted.

[Speaker 3]
What the fuck? Did it?

[Speaker 1]
There it is, apps.diagrams.net.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, Penelope!

[Speaker 3]
She, like, slid off my lap, so you know the claws came out.

[Speaker 2]
Verona will tell the professors how that the girl lieutenant gave her the vase because she didn't like the influence it had over the necromancer.

[Speaker 3]
That is true. And she was worried about it having the influence it would have over us. And she gave us the advice about the circle of blood.

[Speaker 1]
If she did that, then... All right. It's not unsurprising.

This necromancer may be old and may be powerful, but by whatever he's attempting to do, he's likely not to succeed. Yeah, especially if he's doing it in this part of the world. There's too many of the variables.

There's too many of the things he'll... He would not... It would not do him well to trust the felt powers of his play, so he's...

That's good news for us. He's either desperate or under the influence.

[Speaker 5]
Likely desperate.

[Speaker 1]
I'm hoping he's just under the influence, but...

[Speaker 4]
Under the influence of what, exactly?

[Speaker 1]
Well, of extraplanar creatures encouraging him. And if this has anything to do with the Hells, they're just as likely to sweep in and... Uh...

Siphon a bunch of souls away into their realm. More soldiers. Quite a few of them.

All of whom have been practicing, or most of whom have been practicing, magics inaccessible to the living. It's not often that dead people get to practice magic. And strange magics, exactly.

At that point, there was a tier and a more, but... Something of an advantage in that regard.

[Speaker 4]
Was Rana there when we, um... Because he had that guy in the cage. That guy who turned out to be a starspawn.

Was Rana there for the starspawn reveal?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 4]
That's horrifying. Casually. Dude was a starspawn, that's awful!

[Speaker 7]
We brought him into our home! Just now he's hiding out!

[Speaker 4]
The funniest part for me is that I was totally gonna banish him for safety, and he would have just fucking been gone.

[Speaker 2]
I think I'm getting sent back to whatever astral sea.

[Speaker 1]
Awful. The Far Realms. The Nightmares, it's called.

[Speaker 4]
All right, well that line of information is not here right now, so... Alas.

[Speaker 1]
Anyone want to roll for anything, uh, while we are still here? Do you guys want to end it? I can't think of anything.

That's okay. Generating a share link?

[Speaker 3]
The only thing I can think of is, uh, is what's happening to the body with the lightning.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it appears as though anyone with the link. Editor permissions. Tapping this in.

[Speaker 4]
Frogether, are you tapping? Hmm? There's a tapping coming from your side.

It could be...

[Speaker 5]
You could hear my hamster running in the background.

[Speaker 3]
That's delightful.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[Speaker 3]
I love it. I love hearing background animals, as long as they're not, like, loud and annoying.

[Speaker 5]
It's probably annoying him. He's probably very annoyed by the running noise that his wheel is making at the moment.

[Speaker 3]
So it doesn't usually do that. I remember I had a rat, and she had a metal wheel, and so it did that high-pitched squeak. So we got a plastic one, which then did the stupid wibble wobble loud clunky noise instead.

[Speaker 5]
This one's usually pretty silent. It's just hitting the sides right now of his cage, so it's making a bonking noise. Yeah, I'm talking about you.

[Speaker 2]
James, is it just Sebastian that was being blackmailed out of the staff, or was it... Was there a second professor?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, just Sebastian. I'll put that there. And I'm also, you know what, I'm gonna make a thread for this that we can also...

Please tell me I can pin more than one thread. I don't think I can.

[Speaker 2]
So Sebastian was being blackmailed by Scratch and the Eyeless Cult?

[Speaker 1]
No, just by the Eyeless Cult. Because you guys didn't ask by Scratch, you just asked being blackmailed. So try not to answer the only person that he knew of, which was Sebastian.

All right, I made a thread for the Conspiracy Board.

[Speaker 4]
James wants to hear our theories.

[Speaker 5]
Conspiracy theories. My brain's too mushy to come up with any right now, but...

[Speaker 1]
And I will occasionally put stuff, just like in a bubble, when you guys acquire information, that I'll dump into the Conspiracy Board.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, who was being blackmailed by the Necromancer then? That was in the Central Block. Sorry?

[Speaker 1]
The Houndmaster.

[Speaker 2]
The Houndmaster was, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the guy who hired us.

[Speaker 1]
Why can I only pin one post? That's so dumb.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, ah!

[Speaker 6]
Anyways.

[Speaker 1]
One other thing. The girl is holding a... Let's see here.

Is holding a small bell. Oh. Looks like a three-headed serpent.

[Speaker 2]
People in the Conspiracy Board, none of my full name.

[Speaker 5]
Can I see what this is? This seems like a... Like a...

Ashen Coil thing, right?

[Speaker 3]
I can promise you I won't remember it.

[Speaker 2]
My name's so generic, even if you Googled it, you wouldn't find me, so... Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

[Speaker 3]
I have a second Google account that I use for this stuff.

[Speaker 4]
My name... Yep. Also, I think it just shows...

It would just show us as, like, anonymous. At least, that's what it usually does. Nope.

[Speaker 3]
You have to... Signed in.

[Speaker 1]
Are you guys able to open... Oh, yeah. Ooh, can we do this real time?

No fucking way. I'm definitely using this for the rest of my campaigns. What is it?

Damn it.

[Speaker 7]
Wow, it's on the Conspiracy Board.

[Speaker 2]
It must be true. Exactly. Let's just use this for battle maps and stuff.

This is actually pretty fucking sweet. Oh, I like it. This is fun.

[Speaker 5]
I'll open it up later with my other accounts.

[Speaker 1]
I can drag elements there. This is... This is...

This is some gourmet shit.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wow.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder... Oh, you could do multiple pages. Okay, that's probably...

[Speaker 4]
Mine shows up as Starfruit Honey. I forgot that's what my name was on here.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
I have so many different names that I've just collected over the years.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, because this is the same account I use at YouTube.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I almost said something under here, Streams, but it has my full name and I went, No. Mine is not generic enough.

[Speaker 2]
The last part of the session recap that Millie wrote, is it the Linwood Isle that the black arc is below?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
And is Linwood just L-I-N-wood?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I've been spelling it L... I've been doing it L-Y-N in a few different places, so I stopped doing that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. I'm going to do it now, just to fuck with people.

[Speaker 4]
Apparently, if I look up my name, you get nothing.

[Speaker 2]
I really like seeing Necromancer in a pink cloud.

[Speaker 3]
Is it pink? It was pink for a second.

[Speaker 2]
We need to make it pretty.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's apparently Otters. How do you... Okay, hang on.

I'll make it pink.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. Pink and add some, like, stars and love hearts.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, I can do a gradient.

[Speaker 1]
I wasn't expecting somebody to fucking distract me for the 80th fucking time that day.

[Speaker 4]
Like that one. Yeah, I guess I apparently don't care if you guys know my name, because if you look up my name, you get jack fucking shit.

[Speaker 5]
See, I'm not really important enough to care. You guys can know my name. You guys can know any of the names that I've ever made.

[Speaker 4]
My last name is Seashore, so all you get is a fucking beach.

[Speaker 6]
That's awesome. Holy shit.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just glad I didn't decide to log in with my work email.

[Speaker 4]
I still have access, apparently. I apparently still have access to my old work boss's email. Oh, for some reason he made the Orenko stuff his actual fucking email.

So I just have my boss's name, like, randomly on mine, and it just won't leave. Me thought he Lieutenant, girl.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, do we earn some XP? Do we get XP for banishing the Nightwalker, or is that two cheats?

[Speaker 1]
You're gonna get, you're gonna get a lot of XP from him.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yes.

[Speaker 4]
Isn't that supposed to be you get the XP even if it, like, we don't fight the thing?

[Speaker 1]
We don't, but I have, you have to get some XP for doing it. I don't know if you get all the XP, and I'm basically treating it like the, fuck, I wish it was just XP for gold, fuck. But it is, it's still going to be factored in if you...

[Speaker 3]
I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
But at the same time, you can't, like, kill a billion sheep to level up to level 20, if that makes sense.

[Speaker 5]
You can't make a... Yeah? Yeah, what is it?

It's a fucking thing. My brain's not working.

[Speaker 1]
Because if you choose something, you're gonna get a little less XP out of it. No difference being if you do something really well.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, like, by polymorphing it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I was like, how, why would you go around killing sheep? That's rude.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no, that was a joke about sheep being 10 XP. You kill a billion sheep and you level up to level 20.

[Speaker 2]
Somewhere out there, there's a level 20 farmer.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, there's a level 20 farmer just doing his thing on his farm.

[Speaker 2]
The most efficient sheep farmer.

[Speaker 5]
He's the butcher, he's a, yeah, he's pretty cool.

[Speaker 2]
I wish there were more classes in 5e like that sort of stuff, like armor.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, there's probably backgrounds.

[Speaker 4]
There is not a single fucking farmer background in D&D 5e. And I remember this specifically because I had a character whose background was that he was a farm boy, and I could not find a single background for him.

[Speaker 6]
Damn.

[Speaker 2]
What would you want? Athletics and, um, maybe, like, nature as skills? No, athletics and animal handling.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, of course. That's what I have. I grew up on a horse farm.

Nothing except lift hay bales, and, uh, you have to set that completely again. I lifted a lot of fucking hay bales, let me tell you. And I rode a lot of, spent a lot of time on horseback.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, I grew up right across from a horse place, and I loved it.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so for the, for the things, um, my recommendation, basically, just, uh, drop a thing of information down and then draw a line to something when the threads connect. Or keep like, all right, the necromancer thread is going to be pink. So anytime a, an information from a different thread, like, oh, here's Thressia over here, here's Zathane over here, here's Ahmed, you can be like, oh, pink line goes over here about this information.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you know what? Um, this works fine. But I also found out there's a foundry module that doesn't.

This probably works a little bit better just because it's a little bit separated. And I, this obviously you've used before.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, I found this two seconds ago. Otherwise I would have had this at the beginning of the campaign. It's stuff like this that makes me want to like, oh, but maybe if I ever did run 5e again, I could do like one more campaign of this, just one more campaign of this to see how it would go if I was like, if I had something.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, a fun thing would be to try converting it into Pathfinder would be fun.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, holy fuck, that would be awesome. Pathfinder would be so much better for something like this.

[Speaker 4]
Your second, your secondary classes would stack so well into Pathfinder. I think so, yeah. I mean, it could be, they could be archetype.

Or like things like that. And then you could do.

[Speaker 2]
In the Adventure Path Strength of the Thousands, you get all of your regular stuff and you also get to pick a branch of the school that you're part of. And you get to study and level up in the school and you get like, it's also like a free archetype. So like a secondary class, for example, like the Tempest Sun mages are all based around like intimidation and like being like heroes and stuff like that.

Whereas like there's other parts where it's like based around knowledge and research. And like, there's also like rain scourge, there's nature and healing and it's really cool. I really think it would really work well doing something like this game in Pathfinder 2.

[Speaker 4]
It's fucking exciting, holy shit. Yeah, I'd do this again if it was in Pathfinder 2.

[Speaker 5]
I've never played Pathfinder, but as I've stated before, I'm down to learn.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'd totally be down to try instead of run.

[Speaker 1]
Right? Most of the games on the server are probably going to convert to Pathfinder 2 edition next, aside from a few other fun games that are coming out. And then, what should we call it?

Yeah, like one other. I think I'm going to finish the playtest version of Folding Tides, which is the last and very final, very final iteration of the original Lords of Braccus that I came up with ages ago. Just finally, it's like, all right, this is it.

This is all my lessons from Chill Miss Valley that I can just kind of dump into the game. Actually, we're just going to start with the war game tier, and then move downwards as the game goes on. It's like forcing people to move upwards.

That's my last question before I go to bed. How did you guys like how the hirelings were handled in the past two sessions?

[Speaker 5]
I like that. I don't really have a reference to how they were before, but I like what they are.

[Speaker 4]
I'm mixed, mostly because I wasn't really interacting with it that much. So I don't really think I have much of an opinion, but I also kind of like the way it is. It makes me feel powerful.

It is nice that they just, like, add the damage on, but I also feel like we forgot it a lot.

[Speaker 3]
You do forget a lot. And that can just be, like, we get used to it. Yeah, I liked it.

It kept them there without being annoying. Like, we didn't have to control them completely. And they also got DJ out of being paralyzed.

So, you know. Definitely want to get...

[Speaker 5]
I want Karis to have... I want her to get some hirelings.

[Speaker 3]
And I can just carry her around on a nice pillow.

[Speaker 5]
Well, no. She wants to set up a, like, a little thieving crime ring.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's right!

[Speaker 5]
If I can hire some hirelings, I can start, like, a little thieves guild.

[Speaker 6]
Unless there's already one.

[Speaker 3]
Mimosa can help you with that, since she is a rogue. And tactically, one of her sons is a criminal. All right, all right.

So, in the criminal world, I should say.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that'll be fun. I got all the thieving and assassination tables next to our thieving, kidnapping, and re-education.

[Speaker 5]
Re-education? What is this?

[Speaker 1]
Well, every time I talk about patron characters or... Okay, so there's big bad evil guys, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And they don't just, like, go around murder-stomping second-level characters, or even fifth-level, or even eighth-level characters. They're not attacking you directly right now. It's presumably they have a bunch of other shit that they have to deal with on the map.

Um, but still, people will say, like, I'll say that, like, so, so, I mean, big bad evil guys don't herb-stomp people in a normal campaign. Like, yeah, because it wouldn't be fun. Like, no, because it doesn't, it doesn't make sense.

They're supposed to be dealing with other stuff, and the PCs are small fry until it's too late. That's how the structure of the campaign normally goes. And that guy has to deal with them.

And we were arguing about how, uh, if you gave a big bad evil guy to somebody outside the table, they would just hire a bunch of assassins and start murdering the player characters that way. I said, well, no, that's dumb, because they have all this other shit to deal with. It's like, well, across the conversation, I decided to think of, like, all right, what does that other shit look like?

And the assassination tables, I was like, okay, this is going to be the least common thing that they do. Here's all the reasons why. Here's why it generally sucks.

Guess what? There's, there's, there were four of you. There are four player characters tonight, but there were six people in the party.

For one thing, the assassin might think that, uh, Devitt was the target, or Caper was the target, and kill that guy. And now the party, sure, the party is down a companion character, but they didn't lose a player character. And now that patron just lost a bunch of gold on him.

So long story short, uh, thieving, kidnapping, and re-education, like the three ones that people were going to meet more often, and especially about, against you guys soon. Because the thought was, Why would you kill somebody? If you could kidnap them for ransom?

If you could, if you could maybe sacrifice them? If you could steal an item from them? A lot of you guys are using artifacts.

Maybe somebody tries to come take it, and then you get a quest to go get it back. Or maybe a little bit of mind control. Not something that takes your character agency away.

Just for like, you're gonna go, you're gonna adventure, not at this place. Or if you do adventure in this place, you're gonna do this one little thing that's gonna break the enchantment. That's gonna be really helpful for the bad guy.

[Speaker 2]
And all half the, all of the people went to the dragon cave to sleep the agents, the green god.

[Speaker 7]
Oh yeah!

[Speaker 6]
No! That's wild!

[Speaker 1]
This whole campaign is actually an allegory for MKUltra.

[Speaker 2]
Maya's not worried. She's glad she just has a sweet cloak of invisibility. People aren't gonna follow her back home and kill her.

It'll be fine.

[Speaker 5]
Speaking of crime and whatnot, when is Karis available to downtime action? Is that like, anytime?

[Speaker 1]
When did Karis...

[Speaker 5]
I don't know when she got back into town, or if at all, yet.

[Speaker 1]
Karis gets back into town in about six days.

[Speaker 5]
Six days? Goddamn, why is she out so long?

[Speaker 3]
Did we just teleport? She fights the dragon?

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I don't want her to be.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. When does the fucking thing get back? All right, today's the 4th.

When does Dragonheart Pump Party return to the Sierras? If the boat wants to recover some lost people as like a downtime action, maybe for... Maybe that could be Jesse's downtime action, or like a hireling at the keep, because there's fucking plenty of them.

If you want to swing those guys by to pick up Karis early, and some of the other party members, so that they can be active again.

[Speaker 5]
I'm sure they would appreciate it as well. There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Jesse will do that. He'll organize getting people out and back. People, lots of people owe Jesse favors.

[Speaker 7]
I have an establishment, yes!

[Speaker 2]
I can make rumors.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I feel like if we did this conspiracy board inside Foundry, it would just be, like it would just be...

[Speaker 4]
It would be a mess.

[Speaker 1]
It would just be a map, I feel. But also that, also definitely. Yeah, pretty much anytime that you guys do a downtime action for like research or information or shit like that, I'll just put a note on here, and you guys can collect that information together.

And hopefully that'll help people progress in some quest threads, in a way that they're down with.

[Speaker 7]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
I looked up Teresia in the discord, and it's just like going all the way back to like Orville and stuff. I'm like, ah, that's helpful. Thank you, Orville.

[Speaker 3]
I think Mimosa was talking with her too.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think it's Buddy, I saw.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, and what is she? She's a Fae. She's like the Fae of death or something, right?

[Speaker 1]
She's the Fae of northern... She's the Marquee of Light.

[Speaker 3]
How many pages do I have in my book?

[Speaker 1]
47.

[Speaker 3]
That's enough for all the gods, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's enough for all the Fae.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, well, yeah. That would be fun.

[Speaker 2]
What do you have, a death knight?

[Speaker 1]
There's a reason there's like three or four Fae in every single campaign book. I refer to all five campaign books, I refer to them as... If this person is still alive...

[Speaker 3]
I have a book that lets me scoop up Fae. Oh. Where is it?

[Speaker 5]
This! Ooh, who has that much character? I have it right there.

Mimosa! Mimosa? Yeah.

Charis might need to get in contact with you then.

[Speaker 2]
You probably need to have a big player character meeting at Sierra's Keep, which will be the creation of the conspiracy plot.

[Speaker 3]
Mimosa will make a talking stick.

[Speaker 1]
Does anyone want to do like a voice chat session about that for just like hanging out? And it could be just like a day thing.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, that would be good. I'm down. I'd probably be down to show up at some point if it's on a day where I can show up.

[Speaker 1]
You wouldn't have to be there the whole day, it would just be like a like on a weekend thing. Hey, anybody wants to hang out?

[Speaker 5]
Right. Yeah, I'm down.

[Speaker 2]
I'm happy to do that when I'm free. I want to be about next weekend, but afterwards.

[Speaker 3]
I won't be around.

[Speaker 4]
That's okay, I don't think a lot of people will be around next weekend.

[Speaker 3]
It's Thanksgiving.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's Thanksgiving. I'm seeing Paramore.

[Speaker 3]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 5]
Significantly better.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Okay, I'm gonna set it for two weeks from now. And I'll set it for like midday start.

Yeah, we were starting old scratch. That was just supposed to start automatically.

[Speaker 6]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
And now it's over.

[Speaker 6]
Hehe.

[Speaker 2]
Brenna's gonna level up. She needs 200 XP. It's gonna be real sad if we don't get that from this.

Alright, 600 XP.

[Speaker 1]
No, you'll be fine. And also, Edith. Feel free to take any of the magic items that are not getting used right now.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know what magic items aren't being used. A lot of them.

[Speaker 1]
Anything that's probably- Oh, right.

[Speaker 3]
I never did that.

[Speaker 1]
Do we have a folder to move?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think that's what Otter was just saying. We talked about that last night.

[Speaker 2]
Is there? I don't see a folder for it. If there is one.

[Speaker 1]
A folder for what?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it hasn't been made yet? A claimed loot folder?

[Speaker 3]
Correct. Awesome. Teakwood leveled up.

[Speaker 1]
I think the idea is you make an individual folder for your characters.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have permission to do that. That it would just be a folder because a lot of people don't have permission. Actually, I don't know if people would be able to move things.

[Speaker 2]
I don't have permission for folders.

[Speaker 4]
I can create a folder because I'm special. Nope, never mind. I don't have permission to view this sheet for this folder.

[Speaker 2]
Humbled by folders.

[Speaker 4]
That's okay, I'm leveling up Teakwood anyway. Oh, Monk didn't level up.

[Speaker 5]
I think whenever Kibi does another game, she'll definitely be leveling up.

[Speaker 3]
Is Kibi with Mimosa?

[Speaker 5]
I think?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she is.

[Speaker 5]
Was it Kibi that was with us on that one? On the Care Union? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, when we went to the Undead Place. Yeah, because it wasn't your Fae, so it would have to have been Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
Because you had to make your Monk for the Linwood.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I made the Monk before then, and was very excited to be able to play this.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi was a fucking boss on that one.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, she was.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so if I just do... If I just make a new folder called Claimed...

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I guess I could test it, because I have the Orb of the Veil, correct?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I was able to move it into a thing, so we can move it into other folders, we just can't create the folder.

[Speaker 1]
If I just create Discovered...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's not giving permission to us, though.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to create a folder here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, because it's empty! Right? Like, they don't show up when there's nothing in it.

[Speaker 6]
Right. I feel like you've said something like that. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Claimed Items. Item. I have moved my bridle in.

Excellent. Excellent. Let's go.

[Speaker 4]
Orb of the Veil. Oh, I just dragged something over, I don't know what that was.

[Speaker 1]
Occasionally, I will drag items that are not in use over to the Chief.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see, did I have anything else?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think that's all I had.

[Speaker 4]
Someone had the Eversmoking Bottle, I thought. Maybe I'm wrong. Not me.

[Speaker 1]
It was somebody who's probably gone.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you could like, pilfer through all the carcasses of players that are gone.

[Speaker 4]
Steal people's shit. Yeah! Love stealing people's shit.

[Speaker 5]
Especially if they don't deserve it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think that's everything that I've taken. So I don't get a new spell. That's fine.

Can't get rid of.

[Speaker 2]
I have also claimed my things. With that, I am going to head off. Thank you for running today, James.

It was a lot of fun.

[Speaker 1]
I will catch y'all next time.

[Speaker 6]
Alrighty. Bye. Bye.

Cheers.

[Speaker 5]
Value of Field entity type must be what? I guess I'll go to. I haven't slept in a long time.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, you can nap in.

[Speaker 4]
It was nice seeing you.

[Speaker 5]
It was, it was.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, thanks for playing, everybody.

[Speaker 5]
Let me know when the next game is, and I'll try to join.

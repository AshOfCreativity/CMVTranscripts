[Speaker 5]
Your actor sheet up into the party folder, just so we get an idea of who's coming tonight.

[Speaker 4]
So you can see Daxter has dragged up Kahali, and I have dragged my penguin up there, Cece, as well.

[Speaker 5]
If it will let me, it won't let me scroll. There we go. It's scrolling.

There we go. Very good. How are you doing, James?

[Speaker 2]
I'm a little sleepy. I got like three hours sleep and then I got a quick nap last night for like two hours that maybe had to work.

[Speaker 5]
Yeesh. That's rough, man.

[Speaker 10]
I had a good sleep, thankfully.

[Speaker 11]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 4]
We can spend the session fucking around at the piano on the first floor of the bluff to keep it easy. I'll just swap over to my Raph account and I can run it from there.

[Speaker 5]
No, I gotta be, so I gotta be a little bit quiet because it's in the morning here. I apologize in advance if I don't get to mute myself before I either sneeze or cough, I am a bit sick. I have been coughing a lot today, so apologies, Sam.

God bless you in advance. There's something wrong with the bug in Sound Up. I can't get the camera to move.

Oh, beautiful. Now I'm going to double check for the people that we stole.

[Speaker 10]
That was like 10 people that RSVP'd, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's down to eight now and one of them is me, obviously, and then two of them, I am 90% sure are not going to be coming because they're, uh, let's see here, Skoda. American. Yeah, Skoda works over in Ireland, I do, but I don't think that he's going to be in.

[Speaker 5]
They are not interested in the event the Frograther and Skoda did. Oh, okay, and there's Harp, he's going to be late, and there's Andromeda and Velok. Does Velok have a character?

They do. No? They might have a character.

Do they have a Foundry login? Yes. Yeah, they got one.

They might be the, oh no, they have a character just named Velok. Yeah, there it is. That's not scary.

[Speaker 10]
I love it when GMs roll random dice.

[Speaker 5]
James is old school, he loves rolling dice for generating stuff.

[Speaker 10]
I do, I do. Too much almost. It puts me on edge.

[Speaker 5]
While we're waiting to get started, I'll be back.

[Speaker 1]
Especially because I play a lot of, like, rogues and stuff, or like people that have automatic, like, perception checks for various things.

[Speaker 10]
So I'm conditioned to hear DM rolling random dice and be like, oh god, there's a trap here. I'm usually the GM rolling the random dice, so I'm not scared. Yeah, because you know what they're for, I don't, GM.

[Speaker 5]
And I haven't played in, like, two years. It's hard to remember. Hi.

Hello.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I got sucked into Hero Forge. And apparently, apparently for two and a half hours, I did not realize.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, no, it happens. I've been there.

[Speaker 5]
Well, not on Hero Forge, I don't do that, but the ADHD hyperfixation makes time pass in a blink. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

So do you make real art instead?

[Speaker 10]
Uh, me? No. My partner's an artist.

I'm not.

[Speaker 5]
I am woefully talentless when it comes to stuff like that.

[Speaker 8]
My character's a Vindicator, and I decided to change her deity the last minute, basically.

[Speaker 3]
And then I was like, well, I have to update all of her color, her entire color palette now.

[Speaker 10]
What deity did you end up going with?

[Speaker 8]
I went with, I don't know if they're going to come up ever, because I don't know what type of setting this is, but I went with Shirizu from the Taimen. She's the goddess of the sun, order, ancestors and growth. She's the she's the samurai goddess and is a big golden dragon.

[Speaker 3]
And my character is not on purpose.

[Speaker 8]
My character is very, is very, very similar to Samurai Jack. I think I haven't actually watched the show all the way through, but there's some distinct similarities that I think are there.

[Speaker 3]
And originally, I was Iore, which is like monks and stuff. And I was like, well, she's like really, really obsessed with like, justice and all that, all that paladin. Did you consider me loli?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't. I don't know. I have a look at Milani.

Highly recommend. Let me type the, there you go. I already, I already.

[Speaker 8]
I do like, I do like the change domain a lot.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like this character is, this is, this is cool. I feel like it's got a late for this session. And this character is like relatively lawful, like, like a, like 70, 30.

Chaos order spectrum.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to turn this music down. There you go.

[Speaker 3]
She's okay with, she's like, um, like party members stealing first reaction, make sure they're okay. And like their finances are good. They don't owe anyone money.

Then they'd ask them nicely to stop. Ask if they won't stop, ask them to please feel only for people who can't afford to be stolen from. And if they don't do that, I feel like, well, I've sworn an oath to protect the weak from the strong and those who have power over them, but you steal from somebody and you kind of using your power.

[Speaker 8]
And, uh, I don't like it when nobles do that. I also don't like that, but these do that.

[Speaker 5]
So it's, uh, can't, you know, just at your own risk. I try to argue I'm the weak stealing from the strong. Depends on who you are.

I would assume.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it does.

[Speaker 1]
Which is why it's like, Hey, don't steal from random people on the street. Then probably not.

[Speaker 3]
But if you're like stealing, I don't. Yeah. She's like feeling is bad in general, but you have to do it.

[Speaker 8]
I won't actively stop you from stealing. Or like a fucking, but I, um, uh, she also is like, I, she feels that power and all that has should be earned and birthright isn't earning it. Uh, I might, I might switch, switch up.

I think after this session, I might, if that's allowed, I might, uh, look into this more, but I feel like I, we're going to be starting soon.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna just kind of go with what I have right now.

[Speaker 8]
Uh, but, uh, is, is, uh, Milani more like prevalent in this campaign setting?

[Speaker 10]
I don't know. I'm, uh, if you read the, uh, like, uh, synopsis on what Milani, like believes in what the followers, um, do then it's, it's very good for like the justice seeking kind of paladin style characters.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it does seem good. Uh, but also this character is, is like, uh, uh, it might not work for your character.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just, I've made a lot of characters also like got a lot of monk vibes and, uh, okay.

[Speaker 8]
God is about chaos. Kind of doesn't quite fit that. Yeah.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Milani is more about chaotic, violent revolution than like, which this, this character is like, I align this character, align, uh, uh, palette palette. I forgot. Palatine.

I forgot if it was a T or a D align palatine. I would say is, uh, uh, chaos with a order is anarchy, uh, order with a chaos is tyranny.

[Speaker 5]
Both are untenable. It's done silent, I guess. Uh, did you guys hear what I said?

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Um, I'm lying. This character would say is, uh, uh, chaos with a order is anarchy.

Uh, order with a chaos is tyranny. Both are untenable. Uh, where is that quote from?

[Speaker 1]
That is from somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
I, I have no idea if it's from somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
It just lives in my brain and I do not recall it. I know it's from somewhere. It's probably is.

It just lives in my lives in my head. Uh, uh, there's, there's several quotes I have that are from somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
Um, some of them are from songs, like, uh, another I've written down a couple of like, um, or they're in my brain. I'm going to write down a couple of like, uh, quick, like one-liners to throw out, um, like in-character one-liners or catchphrases.

[Speaker 1]
I, I will not have anything like that. My character has minus one charisma.

[Speaker 10]
They're mostly going to be very quiet, meditative almost.

[Speaker 8]
This character is like, unless we're fighting or it's related to like my, my deity, I am so socially awkward.

[Speaker 10]
Like less my, my, okay. My character is less socially awkward and more just not social. Um, no, I can't assist with the stonebound dedication.

Um, they're very like one track, one track kind of thing.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm. Well, Lonnie does, uh, appeal to me as a, as a, as just a, just a human person. Uh, I, and, uh, in, in, in just normal life, I feel like, uh, yeah, quite resonant with me.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

It's, it's bad. You're America, right? Yes.

Yeah. I am. Yeah.

[Speaker 10]
Morning.

[Speaker 1]
Morning.

[Speaker 10]
It's not much better over here. It's, it's better, but it's not much better. I'm the UK.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. Everything's getting worse.

[Speaker 5]
We...

[Speaker 10]
Well, you know what they say, it's got to get worse before it gets better.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yeah. I'll probably, uh, next character, I'll probably, uh, probably go for Milani.

You can see that definitely. Hey you. Hey, how's it going?

Good and how's everyone going? Are you firing yet? We have not started yet.

[Speaker 2]
I've been waiting for Landy to get back and I've been tempted to grab a little bit of coffee. I did take some. So it's like, yeah, I could get away with it.

I did just get back.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah. Oh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
If that's the case, what I'd like everybody to do is just briefly introduce, uh, your character, what they look like, what their class is, you know, ancestry, and then you could like, add like, more true sentences about their demeanor if you want. But that's, I don't pressure people to like, come up with an artistic description right off the bat.

[Speaker 5]
We'll see. And I'm going to elect somebody in the next 10 seconds, unless somebody wants to volunteer.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, do we want to go top to bottom in the Discord?

[Speaker 4]
I can go first.

[Speaker 5]
My character CC is a very sad penguin. He's an oracle. He's can do healing spells.

He's fully black. Very good. Very.

Amazing. Who do you have? I don't know.

What's everyone's level? I have a ranger. I have a ranger.

[Speaker 9]
He's a, uh, a gunner. And he likes to go pew pew pew.

[Speaker 6]
You. Young, excited, I thought we'd have a third ranger.

[Speaker 5]
They are the skeleton. Not that's. Kuji.

Oh, Kuji's right.

[Speaker 10]
So everybody else who's able to. Yes. Oh, he's go ahead.

I was going to say, I've got Josh there, a rock dwarf.

[Speaker 1]
Kineticist with the stone lab dedication, very.

[Speaker 10]
Mountain kind of vibes, very quiet character. Yeah, I'm not going to coming up with descriptions off the fly.

[Speaker 5]
It's totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
They don't really exist till your first few sessions anyways. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Baxter. OK, I have Holly, who is a. Polo outwit ranger resembling a striped hyena.

You can Google that if you. Feel like it. Very book smart, not very street smart.

It's monsters.

[Speaker 8]
That's the sort of thing, and those are dope as hell.

[Speaker 5]
Cool. What's there? What's your class again?

Ranger. Oh, we're perfect. And then Andromeda.

[Speaker 3]
I, I can post the Euroforge in, I guess I'll just do that in the voiceover flow. Sure. But who's there?

It's good. We do that. Who's there?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, racing class.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm just asking where to because I'm going to do that alongside the rest of what I do, so they are a.

[Speaker 5]
You do racing class. Just. My brain wasn't ready for, for, for this, I.

[Speaker 8]
So. Palestine is a Nara vindicator.

[Speaker 5]
With the Nelson heritage. She. So I mean, Nephilim.

Nephilim Nephilim.

[Speaker 8]
I've never had to say the word out loud. I'm trying not to, and I'm trying not to say tiefling.

[Speaker 11]
She is.

[Speaker 3]
She's pretty weak. She's about five feet tall, can't be more than 100 pounds, has a sword that's kind of too big for her and is dressed like a monk, except for the sword and sort of red and gold armor.

[Speaker 5]
Very good. Very good. Yeah.

I've already described her. Her personality in the conversation, because, yeah, it was good enough to me.

[Speaker 2]
So what we do for these tutorial sessions is we have folks.

[Speaker 5]
That's a really neat thing for Gargoyle. OK, that's way too distracting, my goodness. He's.

That's my bad. That totally threw off my mind of thought.

[Speaker 2]
Can you stop looking at pictures for tokens while I'm doing this? What we do for these tutorial sessions is we come out and we bring you to a tutorial dungeon. So this is one of the few places where I'm happy to interject or people can ask me questions about tips like, you know, gee, what should I do next?

Referee, what do I what's the best idea to go forward here? What are we missing? What not?

And sometimes I'll interject on my own accord while I'm in here. And I try not to do that outside of these dungeons. Main goal here is just to see, hey, if you guys want to collect some loot, let's see how you guys navigate foundry.

Let's see how you work as a team. We have a no antisocial players policy here and. Just to see how good of a fit you are and kind of let you discover whatever gameplay dynamics you seem more interested in and what you want to pursue in the future.

So that's the gist of it. Does anybody need to make any further? Oh, you guys have your characters set up.

Usually, folks will take you by ferry to the hidden bluff, which is an island less than a day's travel away from the coast of Broadlock. I'm going to dump you guys.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, before I do that, it's to put themselves in the party and the party.

[Speaker 2]
I was just about to mention that.

[Speaker 4]
James, I'm not sure if you're aware, the new players don't have access to the file browser, so they can't upload pictures. Interesting. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Andromeda, are you still there? Yeah. Go ahead and drag your character over to that.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with foundry. Go ahead and drag your character just straight up. Until you get to the party.

Should be at the very top. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Go to the hidden bluff.

First and second floors. Beautiful. Now, the hidden bluff is a dwarf hold or an old dwarven hold.

It was rediscovered by dwarves recently. There's a few secrets that have been hidden inside. Some of the players are more familiar with it than others.

I don't think any of the ones from the previous campaign are. We'll explore this dungeon here. Go.

Clear that. Perfect. I'm going to drag you guys out onto the area here.

Most of the spark notes are that there's a residential district which the dwarves have been tunneling into and recently opened, and a bunch of various rat creatures have been spilling out of it. Besides that, Nixie's control and some other water they control or attempt to control that. Like floors four, five and six.

And then floor seven is a cove of mermaids and the Nixie's do not like each other. Besides that, there's random assorted creatures that will spill in from other dungeons, other areas. And that's the gist of it.

So where do I drop you guys? Here we go. Set this to the more no, no, no, no.

This is the correct. My goodness. If I'm going to start advancing game time, normally every 10 minutes or so, I'll check for between every 10 to 30 minutes.

I'll check for things like random encounters and whatnot. But besides that, welcome to the dungeon. This first floor here, immediately inside the entrance, there's no enemies inside here.

There are a few dwarves who have set up shop here. They're kind of licking their wounds. They've been trying to keep the rats back and they were successful until the Nixie's took the opportunity to mess with them at the same time.

There is a split staircase, so there's a top level or top floor to the dungeon that goes all the way up. And you could take up just on this map or you could go down to the second level. And at which point I'll drag you guys over to that second level.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what do you guys want to do? Um, actually, quick rules question. Um, you know how you can repeat a spell?

Can I repeat an impulse?

[Speaker 2]
Are you referring to the repeat a spell exploration activity, right? Yes. Right.

My immediate understanding is no, but I'm happy to check the rules as written.

[Speaker 1]
Rule rules as written.

[Speaker 4]
No, but what's the impulse that you'd like to do?

[Speaker 1]
Armor enough just so that I enter combat, any combats with armor.

[Speaker 4]
Can you ping the ability, please?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
That's a good SOP. If you ever have a rules question, just click on that little chat bubble that drops it into the chat.

[Speaker 4]
Lost for 10 minutes. I don't see why you couldn't be doing this once every 10 minutes. Do you agree with that, James?

[Speaker 2]
Is there any kind of resource calls for it? Nope. No.

On that case, then, yeah, you could just do it once every 10 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing is I don't know how to give myself that effect in Foundry.

[Speaker 4]
You have? So on your character sheet, there's a tab for actions. Is that where you pinged it from?

[Speaker 1]
That's where I pinged it from.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Two Palutenes on the leaderboard.

[Speaker 1]
Kineticist has some weirdly bad automation. Like some of it works, but some of it is.

[Speaker 9]
I'll just put armor in earth and put down whatever the equivalent of it is. It's an armor is reskin it. That'd be for the easiest way.

[Speaker 3]
I thought there was a person named Healthy. I didn't see my name in white, so I didn't think I was there yet.

[Speaker 1]
Are we also able to get the art in for parking, considering they can't upload it themselves?

[Speaker 2]
We're not going to do that right this second, but we can do that after the conclusion of the session. I can figure out why that's not working properly.

[Speaker 4]
James, there is a macro for armor in earth that you need to drag out for.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, is there?

[Speaker 4]
It's in the compendium. I don't know if we have access to it. It is.

[Speaker 1]
If you search. Effect armor in earth. There we go.

Drag that onto myself. There we go.

[Speaker 4]
OK, yeah, that one's just not tied to the feed for some reason, but that should be good now.

[Speaker 1]
It is not giving me the. It's no, I have an effect named Armor of Earth, but it's not it's not doing anything.

[Speaker 9]
Does it give you a worn armor?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. I don't have anything in my inventory other than the original quilted armor that I started with. No, it says it does actually give you worn armor.

[Speaker 2]
It treats it as worn armor. If you mouse over the effect, you'll see armor in earth.

[Speaker 10]
It's not, it says that, but it's not. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just going to go find out.

[Speaker 3]
Can you make a custom armor that has the same effect and like if the armor in earth effect is altered to update that?

[Speaker 9]
I mean, I could. That's my initial suggestion for an easy item.

[Speaker 1]
What's the bulk on this? Bulk one. So it is one bulk.

Medium armor, group plate. Looking for an item called armor in earth. Yeah, I looked for that item, I couldn't find it.

It has check penalties.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I think that's a relic from the kineticist companion module.

[Speaker 2]
Do we not still have that one active?

[Speaker 4]
It doesn't look like you do.

[Speaker 9]
It looks like it's got a broken link.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and companion, companion, what's the other one?

[Speaker 4]
The kineticist companion is the module that handles that, that made those macros. It is not on the game anymore. Weird.

Oh, look, there's a piano.

[Speaker 2]
So we're going to go to my screen, and I'm going to show you Give me just a moment, I'm going to log out. I'm going to return to set up briefly, so it's going to disconnect you guys for a sec.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to install that kineticist companion.

[Speaker 10]
Apologies to cause problems.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's not your fault.

[Speaker 10]
It's technically my fault.

[Speaker 2]
I don't even know why I'm saying technically, it just is. Kineticist companion, there we go.

[Speaker 4]
It's going to be incredibly funny if this crashes the server, James. I don't know if we ever installed this. I mean, we've had kineticists.

Well, the macros are there.

[Speaker 5]
I doubt Otter made them. Otter might have made them, but I doubt it. I don't know, James, maybe you should reconsider installing the module.

[Speaker 4]
It has hardwood armor included. You can no longer snipe people's builds with wooden armor.

[Speaker 2]
So you guys know, if anybody misbehaves, your exit will be integrated with the canon, not just of the server, but also the game itself.

[Speaker 5]
How does that work? You'll never know. It's the funniest.

I guess, no, it's true. It's not true that you'll never know. You just have to outlast another player.

You guys should be able to log back in. It says administer access required. Let's give it a refresh.

There we go.

[Speaker 4]
James, it's so funny that Red Rain's giving you bad reviews. That was easily one of the worst players we've had. No, no.

[Speaker 2]
So that was back in March, right?

[Speaker 4]
When did they join?

[Speaker 2]
Was that before they joined? That was before he actually joined. So credit to him for actually joining and trying out.

But obviously he's gone. It wasn't great. And this guy, Forgotten Sun, has commented, I think, on or done a drive-by, like Emoji React, on every single post I've made in that Foundry server, and I didn't realize it.

[Speaker 8]
That's because this person from my fucking...

[Speaker 2]
They first joined back in 2023, which we didn't start Pathfinder First Edition until 2025. They joined in, I think, from maybe the D&D server or something, or a D&D game.

[Speaker 5]
And they did not even make it to their first session. So if I... I also have to enable the module.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not really sure, but we're going to double-check.

[Speaker 3]
I have been in the process of switching to my desktop, which is not...

[Speaker 8]
Or my girlfriend's desktop, which isn't fully set up with my stuff on it. So when I had it update all my stuff, it updated it to the default browser, which was Edge for some reason. Oh, hold on.

[Speaker 3]
What's up? So I couldn't log into Discord to fix a thing.

[Speaker 8]
My mouse broke, so I had to switch to...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's fine.

[Speaker 8]
Just take your time.

[Speaker 5]
Let me know when you're complete. Yeah. I just...

[Speaker 8]
I had to log in to Microsoft Edge.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I don't want to hear you complain. I want to start getting to the game here. I went to Discord.

It was really light screen. All righty.

[Speaker 4]
There we go. This should be an on-Earth item now. I can see it.

Boundaries loading.

[Speaker 1]
Uh...

[Speaker 3]
I think. There it is.

[Speaker 2]
So bring the macro back in.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's there.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Wonderful. Thank God it worked.

[Speaker 1]
I will get it from the companion. The armor in Earth is that I will redo the macro. Armor in...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, refresh that. And hopefully it's good. Yeah, I can't see why you wouldn't be able to do that once every ten minutes.

That's less demanding than a sustaining spell.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's not a resource. Okay, that doesn't seem to...

[Speaker 4]
Do you have the armor item in your inventory as well as having the macro on?

[Speaker 11]
Let me have a look.

[Speaker 4]
So there's effect armor of Earth listed as an item as well. You'll need that in your inventory so it links to the item.

[Speaker 1]
It's in my inventory. It's not... Automatically equipping.

I've dragged it into my inventory. Oh, it removed it from my inventory when I removed the effect. It is not giving it to me when I gain the effect.

That's okay as long as you're able to apply it. I mean, I can do it all manually, but...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's going to be the solution for the moment. You're free to experiment within the meantime, though. Where does the party want to go first?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... I guess there's no exact order. I was going to say, I am good to follow the rest of the party.

By the way, note for GM, I do have Imprecise Trenison at the minute. At ten foot range.

[Speaker 9]
Handy.

[Speaker 1]
It's quite good, yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Let's go to wherever Dragon is.

[Speaker 10]
I don't know about that one.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, it's the seventh level of the dungeon, I'm pretty sure. There's a dragon. There's a dragon in my heart, always.

Seventh level of the dungeon? No, sixth level of the dungeon, I think.

[Speaker 9]
Aww. Let's get level two.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, two questions.

[Speaker 3]
Gjalli's art is very cute, I like it. Thank you, I tried. You succeeded.

[Speaker 6]
So this place is obviously in disarray. This pool looks like it was formed here by nature, or by human hands?

[Speaker 2]
This one is... I mean, this one has a touch of fate to it, pretty obviously.

[Speaker 6]
Does a cursory glance reveal anything particularly noteworthy in it?

[Speaker 2]
Just a pond. Okay, cool.

[Speaker 3]
Just a pond.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I mean... I'm gonna... I go up.

I will lead the way.

[Speaker 11]
Material knowledge.

[Speaker 2]
Material knowledge with... Why do any of those work? Uh, crafting board.

Any kind of fate pool that has... Any kind of fate pool that has some kind of magical energy to it. You can sometimes...

Either this will happen naturally, in accordance with time, like one of the moons becoming full, or waxing and waning and such. Or... If you toss a coin, or like an offering, sometimes just referred to as tokens, into the pool itself, then you can sometimes get a...

What's the term? What's a game term for something that you can eat, I assume? To empower a spell for a new effect.

What is that? A component?

[Speaker 1]
Atlas, thank you. Yeah. No, spell hearts...

You don't eat it. Like, they're permanent.

[Speaker 8]
Well. So, we're going up the stairs.

[Speaker 3]
We're going up the stairs, and everyone follows. And no one dilly-dallies, and we proceed with the tutorial dungeon. What did you toss into the pool?

One silver piece.

[Speaker 2]
Silver piece?

[Speaker 3]
Nothing happens.

[Speaker 6]
Fair enough. Off we go.

[Speaker 3]
I forgot that there was a thing happening.

[Speaker 2]
So, I'm going to activate an encounter. Go ahead and add yourselves to the encounter, just briefly. Double-check.

[Speaker 1]
How did you do that?

[Speaker 2]
If you right-click your token... I think it's James. Oh yeah, go ahead and right-click your token.

You'll see a sword and shield icon.

[Speaker 11]
Ah, there we are.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, a ranger needs to rec... A ranger needs to recover some hit points.

[Speaker 11]
I don't know how.

[Speaker 3]
I just click on this. Right? Enrolling initiative, you said?

[Speaker 11]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
If you look up the top right now, near where the chat... There's a tab called Encounters. If you click on that one, it'll show the order next to your name.

This should be a prompt to roll. It's a little icon with swords crossed in the top right bar for Encounter. Yeah?

[Speaker 3]
It didn't show up in the chat, so I didn't...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's a different tab to the chat.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I haven't rolled yet. Oh my god, that's what the dice... Foundry.

You should have rolled a 2. I tried that. I think it just didn't get added to the thing.

Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
You can't make it. Fucking ghost-encumbered?

[Speaker 3]
Come on.

[Speaker 5]
Absolutely ridiculous.

[Speaker 3]
Well, if it was encumbered when it died, is it still encumbered? Oh man, getting some...

[Speaker 2]
That's the creation engine mechanics now. So, there are three dwarves here. They are not immediately attacking.

They look kind of... you know, they're neutral. Where's your presence?

They're all looking at you expectantly. And they're standing at attention and guarding the door behind them.

[Speaker 6]
That's the policy we have in the party.

[Speaker 2]
You can actually see shared skills and the party skills, who's best and what languages are available based on the party sheet.

[Speaker 1]
It looks like... No, as he said.

[Speaker 3]
If we're in a city devoted with a temple to my god, I think, I could use religion for diplomacy stuff. Which is... Plus 8?

I don't know if that applies. Is this dungeon in a city? Not quite.

It's on an island that's outside.

[Speaker 2]
If there's people here from the city, like characters from the city or from a place, it's close enough by where if there's people from the city or whatever, that would definitely apply as well.

[Speaker 4]
CC will step forward and say, Hello, mighty ancestors of the dwarven kin. We mean you no harm. We are here to aid you in your plight.

[Speaker 2]
I'm checking to see what their languages are.

[Speaker 1]
I speak common. I do speak dwarven. I could translate if I need to.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm going to have CC roll diplomacy. And then I'm going to have...

Sorry, no, no. Who has dwarven? Who volunteered?

[Speaker 1]
I have dwarven. I'm not trained in diplomacy.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So you roll a diplomacy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And then CC, you roll a diplomacy.

[Speaker 6]
It was nice.

[Speaker 10]
It was nice knowing you guys.

[Speaker 6]
I don't supposedly speak Zagroth.

[Speaker 4]
I roll diplomacy to aid.

[Speaker 1]
That's plus two from aid, right?

[Speaker 4]
It's plus one unless that was a critical success. That was a critical success. Oh, it was?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Aid is based DC 15 unless it's modified. Ah.

[Speaker 10]
Nice.

[Speaker 4]
Now we get killed by dwarven guys.

[Speaker 2]
They say, we have no wish for help at this time. Keep to the other rooms.

[Speaker 10]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 2]
We guard our friends to the rear. Still neutral.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. You guys can choose to exercise. No, no, no.

Sorry to trouble you. Well then. Sorry to trouble you.

I guess we're going down.

[Speaker 2]
There's still the other rooms to the side if you wanted to. They're just indicating.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we could do the rooms to the side first and then come back. Up to you guys. Like these rooms here.

[Speaker 2]
The range of encounters goes up as you guys go down. And so too does the loot. The loot goes up.

Loot goes up regardless of the level range.

[Speaker 1]
Let's pick a door then. I believe you have already picked a door. Let us just.

Is the door locked?

[Speaker 2]
It is. So if you click on the door and it opens, then it is not locked.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I can click on doors. Oh my God.

[Speaker 2]
And you'll see a lock symbol. If I close it and right click it, you'll see that little lock symbol.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We're locked in. It's fine.

[Speaker 4]
We don't get to see the lock symbol. We get to hear it rattle if we try and open it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. If you click it a bunch of times, which is hilarious. This does just look like a dead end.

Go ahead and make me.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we look for a way out.

[Speaker 9]
That's just what they wanted you to believe.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, didn't even notice that.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead and make me a reflex saviour.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's not me. I'm fine. Jesus Christ.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Seven alone at 12. I clicked reflex save.

[Speaker 1]
It should pop out the prompt to roll for it. When you click reflex save.

[Speaker 2]
Click on your own token and then click on DC 22. Don't click on the chat bubble though.

[Speaker 3]
Click on DC 22.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to roll for you in a couple seconds. Which is no pressure. You're fine to keep trying it out there.

[Speaker 3]
And clicking the button, the reflex save button.

[Speaker 1]
Which should pop out a window that prompts you to roll.

[Speaker 2]
It might be because there's an encounter active. So I'm going to delete that.

[Speaker 1]
You succeeded.

[Speaker 11]
There it is.

[Speaker 1]
That was Ranger. That was Ranger. You did succeed.

That's only half. Oh boy. Ouchy.

I didn't believe that.

[Speaker 3]
Instantly died. That would have been fun.

[Speaker 9]
That's true. GG.

[Speaker 2]
Come back as a ghost. Inside these rooms, there's not much going on. There's a few wisps in the air that kind of resemble the ancestral echoes that you guys were looking at a moment ago.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see. Well, on to the other side. I was going to say, can I inspect the door for a trap?

[Speaker 2]
Of course. There's also an exploration activity. I believe it's called seek.

[Speaker 3]
I will be seeking from now on. Exploration activity. That seems fair.

You can add that activity inside the...

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. Exploration.

[Speaker 1]
It's search, not seek, right?

[Speaker 4]
Search is the exploration action that lets you seek.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Seek is the action.

[Speaker 10]
The exploration is search. And then you have scat, which gives you a plus.

[Speaker 3]
How do I...

[Speaker 1]
Where is that? If you go to your actions, you go to exploration. And then if you hit browse, you can search for the search activity in there.

I need to add the activity.

[Speaker 10]
I assume that's my...

[Speaker 2]
This person has made a check so far, right?

[Speaker 10]
I don't think it...

[Speaker 3]
I don't understand. I am clicking browse, which is not doing anything.

[Speaker 1]
It should pop up a separate tab.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it's because my character sheet was popped out. That's why. Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
That would also be why you were struggling to roll. I didn't know.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that solves that. Don't pop that character sheet. I have learned.

Search. So I will be...

[Speaker 1]
Is that a roll that you just did by perception? Or would you like to roll it separately, James?

[Speaker 4]
I didn't know you were in secret perception. Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
There doesn't appear to be any kind of locks, and there doesn't appear to be any traps. But with your tremor sense, your imprecise tremor sense, there is a little bit of movement inside the room.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay, well, with that knowledge, we should make sure that anybody that doesn't want to front line is not front lining.

[Speaker 3]
I... Macy is very good, but I probably shouldn't, because I'm hurt.

[Speaker 4]
Macy just dramatically says, I'll remain at the front. Everybody dies eventually.

[Speaker 1]
I'll open the door. Go ahead and add yourselves to my shibu.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 10]
Not a bad roll.

[Speaker 6]
I was using the scout activity, so we should get a bonus to this. Oh, I keep popping myself that bonus.

[Speaker 4]
Should automatically apply if the effect was active. Was not active, nevermind.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it was just search. Scout wasn't on there. What you want to do is you want to make sure that's attached to the little party exploration tab.

I'm just going to take a quick screenshot of it and put it in voiceover flow.

[Speaker 11]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
After this combat, we'll briefly go over the basic action macros, which do have some exploration activities as well. During a party. We have the Hyacinth of Lamprey.

What initiative did I get? It hides it.

[Speaker 4]
Not active. Does it look like?

[Speaker 1]
I would have, if we were scouting, I would have 24, but that still doesn't make me go higher. Because of how monster rules work. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Anybody that would change Richard's initiative.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
The Hyacinth of Lamprey looks like a large.

[Speaker 11]
No, it's not large at all.

[Speaker 1]
It's tiny. Okay, that's not large.

[Speaker 3]
A large, tiny beast.

[Speaker 2]
It's very thin, willowy. And of course, looks like a flower. It just has some serrated edges in the middle.

It's a speed of five feet. So it's going to slowly move over, and it's tiny, so it has to get in CC space in order to actually do this. Preserve its stuff at the front, so two moves.

Now we're going to try to hit CC and miss. Did they hold a wisp? These things are on time.

Oh, so tiny. Reverse.

[Speaker 3]
Did I have to state earlier that I have my katana out, or do I need to draw it now?

[Speaker 2]
Best thing to do is to mark yourself as holding the weapon. Yeah, I did. Then you should be good to go.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Misses. Again with critical miss.

[Speaker 4]
That attack does have rage, just in case you missed that, James.

[Speaker 2]
I did miss that. The minus four is not going to be hitting anything, though.

[Speaker 1]
We come to Josh. Well, I'm going to step in. So that I'm flanking on there.

It does work flanking tiny creatures, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I always forget the rules on tiny creatures. They're so weird.

[Speaker 4]
The game should automatically apply it, fortunately.

[Speaker 1]
And then I will do a two-action melee elemental. I'll get my impulse junction. I will do a little damage.

Long roll, by the way.

[Speaker 4]
Blimey.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's a full-strength kineticist for you. It is two actions, mind you. So that's my turn.

[Speaker 6]
Go hungry. Okay, I'm going to hunt this little wood wisp. And I do have monster hunter, so I get a recall knowledge check against it.

Oh, nice. And for that, I can use wild imitator. I have a question about that, actually.

So this says I can use it to recall knowledge on creatures to learn their abilities. Does that mean I can only ask about what the wisp's capabilities are, or can I just ask something else? Well, roll first.

[Speaker 2]
So that's going to be something that's key for stuff like any kind of rules questions. Especially mid-combat. In the tutorial dungeon, if you need to take something back because it turns out that something was screwed up, no worries.

In general, it's good to roll first as well, unless it's something that would make you not do it at all. But for something like, for instance, where you get this for free, you want to roll, and then double-check.

[Speaker 1]
This one we don't have to worry about. Strictly speaking, you should have given incorrect information.

[Speaker 4]
It doesn't always give incorrect. No, no, no!

[Speaker 2]
You can use it to recall knowledge about creatures, only to recall knowledge about their abilities. So if you're using the wild mimic lore, I would say that would be the case.

[Speaker 9]
It just loves fire. It loves fire so much.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I'm just going to take a crack at it then. Halberd.

[Speaker 9]
Very good. Halberd. Nice.

[Speaker 6]
Good.

[Speaker 9]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Very nice. Okay, we're hunting the lamp right now. Because why not?

[Speaker 1]
Might as well, you get the recall knowledge.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 9]
And here's that. So it still uses inaction to recall the knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
No, it doesn't. It's reaction. It's Monster Hunter.

Monster Hunter, Hunter Prey, you can free action, recall knowledge on it. Yeah, that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not the mimic lore giving the reaction, it's the Monster Hunter giving the free action. Yeah. Okay.

All right, golly, what else you got? I'm sorry, what were you rolling against?

[Speaker 6]
The lamp prey. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
You're asking a question about its abilities.

[Speaker 6]
Can it do anything other than creep up and bite people? I didn't hear that. Does it have anything special besides creeping up and biting people?

[Speaker 2]
Once it's attached to somebody, it can start draining water from them. Oh, delightful.

[Speaker 6]
I'll let everyone know.

[Speaker 4]
These seals spend an action stepping forward. And he will cast needle darts with two actions. While needle darts does have manipulate.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, why step forward if you're going to needle darts? You don't get the blanket.

[Speaker 4]
I don't, but everyone else does. Thank you. But I'm going to needle darts the vine lusher.

[Speaker 3]
These guys are really squishy.

[Speaker 4]
Forever punished for forgetting to buy cold iron. Ha ha ha. I miss.

All right, that's it.

[Speaker 11]
I'm here to be sad, I'm a bird.

[Speaker 4]
End of my turn. Put my poor penguin out of his misery.

[Speaker 11]
Roll it.

[Speaker 2]
Little bit of damage. Little miss. Delight, caress.

Oh, that was close, though. And thus ends its turn.

[Speaker 9]
Ranger. I'm going to spend one action to activate my ammo. And then I'm going to take a shot.

You shouldn't have. Nobody. That one, the one that's targeted.

All right, critical roll. Fail. I'm going to hear it one time.

Nice. Boom boy.

[Speaker 1]
Done. Holy, I'm just playing a damage. Oh, you have a striking rune.

Oh, okay. Well. It had six hit points.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah. Is there anything still left?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 9]
I'm going to do a thoughtful reload. And I'm going to upload another elemental ammunition fire. That's my turn.

[Speaker 2]
That's good. Are you asking specific questions about the vine lasher?

[Speaker 9]
Weakness.

[Speaker 2]
Weakness to? Weaknesses. No strengths, resistances or immunities either.

[Speaker 10]
I would have thought it would have been weakness to fire, but it's not.

[Speaker 3]
Can I, can I go through someone's space?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. It has to be a willing ally. Yeah, willing ally.

[Speaker 3]
I asked the penguin permission to walk past and then I very politely walk past. And I, that was. I believe I have enough movement to get, would here be flanking?

It would have to be. It's not really a space.

[Speaker 4]
It needs to be there.

[Speaker 3]
And do I have enough space to fit there? No.

[Speaker 4]
Cool.

[Speaker 3]
I guess I'll move. No, I don't want to have enough. Nevermind.

I will. Currently no flanking position available. Are you looking to attack?

Yeah, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm just going to attack. I'm going to figure out how rolling to hit works in this system. Double click on your, hey, that hits.

Okay, great. And then I hit click on damage. And yeah.

14.

[Speaker 1]
Nice, that's a max roll.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Is it still good? One action left.

Can I try this? I don't, I don't have any particular beef with plant creatures. I don't think I can, like, to where oath is one action to fuck with this guy for something.

Because it's just like a guy. But it's not my, I don't think attacking this person would be within my personal. From my domain initiate.

I'm thinking, I, if the action is in line with my personal edicts, or the edicts presented by my religion, I can cast it as a single action. I want to, like, cast it to ready action to, like, hit it when someone else hits it, if I can do that. I don't think that this fits at all, or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
But you would have a single action left for any other single action.

[Speaker 3]
I'll just mark prey. And nothing happens when I mark prey, I just do it. All righty.

[Speaker 1]
It's a hard effort to hide from you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and if I have a chance to cast the Vindicator's Mark, I can do that, but I don't think it's going to be required.

[Speaker 4]
Dice. Very nice.

[Speaker 1]
Average Kineticist turns.

[Speaker 10]
Early levels.

[Speaker 2]
What's going on here?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, well, I am still searching as my exploration activity. Can I check behind this door now? Or check this door, and then does my Tremorsense sense anything?

[Speaker 3]
Can I, like, aid that? Because I'm also seeking, or how's that? If you'd like to hold the aid, that's certainly fine.

I think I'll aid because you have Tremorsense, and I want to help the Tremorsense at them, but I can't see anything.

[Speaker 1]
Tremorsense, you wouldn't need to help, that's just automatic. You would be helping my Perception on the door, to see if it's trapped.

[Speaker 3]
Listen, I don't know how... Palutene doesn't know how your Tremorsense works, she is helping.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, well... How do I aid?

[Speaker 3]
How do I... How do I aid?

[Speaker 1]
You wouldn't be able to aid my Tremorsense, because it's not a skill.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm aiding the Perception check.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay, you just make a Perception check, and then it gives me a plus one.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. And I see Perception for initiative, where... No trap on this door.

[Speaker 9]
Just above it would be Perception. Yeah, it's above it.

[Speaker 1]
You've got the dice and then the eye next to it. Like the crystal eye. There it is.

Hey, you get a plus one! Woohoo! Every little help.

I'm rolling very terribly. I mean, you roll a five. It could be worse.

[Speaker 2]
You can sense the presence of other vines, other vine slashers and such, on the other side of the door. There is one thing that's larger that you wouldn't recognize. The vines appear to be trying to hold the door shut.

[Speaker 10]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
Am I able to attempt to force open, or would anybody like to also do that?

[Speaker 3]
I think this would be Athletics, right? Yeah, it's Athletics.

[Speaker 2]
If you guys hear Athletics, go ahead and look down at your... Everybody can see that macro bar, the hot bar at the bottom, right?

[Speaker 11]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Beautiful. The one that has numbers going through.

[Speaker 2]
There's a little folder icon to the left of it that says collapse macro hot bar and also browse macro directory. I want you to click on that button that says browse macro directory. Then you should see basic action macros quite close to the top.

Once you do that, you just drag it, literally click and drag over to your hot bar. That brings up a bunch of things like, for instance, provided your token is selected, a bunch of basic actions like force open.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Does anybody have a crowbar?

[Speaker 1]
I do not have a crowbar. That's a two. Yeah, I do not have a crowbar.

Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
This is the type of thing where it gets harder if you try and fail multiple times.

[Speaker 1]
Give me a sec. I could... I can't do that.

I need extended kinesis to be able to do something like that. Can I just give it another go? Am I able to...

One more time? Am I able to give force open a go?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, there's nothing stopping you guys. It just makes noise and takes longer as time goes on.

[Speaker 3]
To be fair, I am a very tiny human being, this is a very large door.

[Speaker 1]
That's a five.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. James Dawes are once again proving our greatest enemy.

[Speaker 3]
And now, assuming that fails, I'll try. We'll just tag team.

[Speaker 9]
I'd like to shoot the door to break it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, 13 worked.

[Speaker 8]
Yay.

[Speaker 11]
Oops.

[Speaker 9]
I meant to try to target the door. But I opened it. Wait, does that mean it's just unlocked?

[Speaker 2]
Nobody else has made a roll.

[Speaker 8]
I'll try force opening again.

[Speaker 1]
We are not rolling high.

[Speaker 3]
Athletics is like my best skill, this is great.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, same. Just pull the handle.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah, I will try the handle.

[Speaker 2]
As mentioned earlier, the vine's on the other side, just kind of holding it closed.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I thought so. I'm just going to keep going. What do we have to lose?

The same roll. I'm just... Okay.

[Speaker 9]
I'd like to recall knowledge check on the door to see how strong they are.

[Speaker 3]
I rolled a 20. I saw that. Sorry, just a moment.

Sorry, if that was too hasty.

[Speaker 2]
One moment, please. Sorry, Ranger, what were you saying? I should have...

[Speaker 9]
I'd like to recall knowledge on the strength of the door.

[Speaker 2]
Knowledge on the strength of the door. Well, you could always shoot the hinges off. Just got to shoot twice and hope nothing nasty occurred.

[Speaker 3]
I did try again after the 13. I saw that. And it didn't work?

Fixing something with somebody else.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Okay, so 20. You stay back and I'll peel the door shut open.

[Speaker 2]
How hard are you going to be open? After the 20. I've got to do one other thing first.

Go ahead, everybody go ahead and manage yourselves to be...

[Speaker 8]
Enter here.

[Speaker 1]
God, my rolls have been... They sure are something.

[Speaker 3]
I finally rolled well. Hey, I finally rolled well! Nice, I can be the first one in and I'm super, super beat up, so that's going to be great.

It'll be a great plan to rush in first. Oh no, I'm not first, Ranger is first. Ah.

[Speaker 9]
Do we see what's on the other side of the door once we roll initiative?

[Speaker 2]
Actually, what's the rule for stealthy? Well, it's not going to matter because it's... I'm first.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Hello, Heart. Hey, Heart.

[Speaker 7]
I've been going.

[Speaker 4]
Just saw your message. You're about to get eaten by spiders and vine lashes. Spider singular.

[Speaker 2]
You guys can hear the sound of crumbling rocks and streaks.

[Speaker 10]
What? There was a heart left. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
And now they're back. And muted. No worries.

[Speaker 2]
That's just heart. That's just heart. You guys can hear some rock noises and animalistic streaks.

Kind of sound like grinding teeth. Coming from the... These are windows on the north side of the room.

And there is a hole on the other side, on the other end of them. A hole? We can find out what those are.

Well, I'll look at their movement speed in a moment. Oh, you can find out what those are at the start of the next round.

[Speaker 9]
Would that one have cover on me?

[Speaker 1]
What do you... Oh, that's my bad.

[Speaker 2]
You can't see him, can you?

[Speaker 9]
I can't see him.

[Speaker 2]
No, you can see him. But you can also see his initiative.

[Speaker 8]
Which is higher than you. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'll flip a coin.

[Speaker 10]
Ooh, critical miss. Natural one.

[Speaker 1]
Which means it has a plus nine to hit. That's a lot. That's only, like, a level above us.

It could have a plus six. Ooh, nine rolled a three.

[Speaker 3]
I'm used to 5P numbers with plus nine.

[Speaker 1]
It's a critical miss by minus nine, which means it has to be a natural one. Oh, wait a second. Which means it has to be a plus nine to hit.

[Speaker 2]
Four rolls, let me see. Hunting spider. How does it work?

When you rolled stealth or initiative, this is the first time I've done this in literal months. What benefits does that give you?

[Speaker 1]
That stealth roll... Yeah, that initiative roll is used for the stealth check. Okay.

[Speaker 9]
Is how it works.

[Speaker 1]
And that's it?

[Speaker 9]
As Canada's concealed from any creature underneath it? Yeah. So to say if Palutene rolled stealth, any creature underneath him would be concealed, but the people in front of him would notice him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Also, it's a benefit for rogues as well.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Oh, sweet.

[Speaker 9]
Ranger. Well, I guess he's in range now. I'm going to use one action to activate my elemental attack.

And I'm going to go pew-pew.

[Speaker 1]
I probably would be granting you cover here.

[Speaker 9]
Seven. Item. Five.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, is that it? It's a hit. There it is.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, jeez.

[Speaker 3]
Very nice. I'm going to get rid of that. Oops.

Oops. Oops.

[Speaker 9]
And that'd be one splash damage. How could you?

[Speaker 1]
Can you roll the splash so that I can take it?

[Speaker 9]
It should be on there. It's not. I think the creature itself only takes a splash damage?

[Speaker 1]
No. It deals one persistent damage and also one splash damage to all creatures. Because it specifies to the target on the persistent, which means the splash damage is being treated normally.

Yeah, but it doesn't have a range for the splash. Well, splash by default is just all creatures around it in five foot.

[Speaker 4]
It's in the trait.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're thinking of... Is it burst, the other one? No, it's not burst.

[Speaker 4]
Animation?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's scatter. That's what I'm thinking of. You're thinking of scatter.

So...

[Speaker 9]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. So we all take that. What?

Me and Palutene, and then also the other. And the last one.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And then what's the persistent untyped?

[Speaker 9]
Fire. So everyone takes one fire damage, and that one takes one persistent fire.

[Speaker 1]
SMH, why couldn't it have been slashing damage?

[Speaker 9]
And they need to do a thoughtful reload, but I don't think there's much to know about this creature. That's my turn. And I'm going to load up an acid shot.

[Speaker 2]
The fire is just to the...

[Speaker 1]
I thought the fire was just to the... What do you call it? It's one persistent fire damage to the main one, and then one splash fire damage to everything.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
No, I rolled it as persistent type. Come on, man. Wait, no.

No. No, don't you... Okay.

Okay. That's going to be it for the moment.

[Speaker 1]
Palutene, you don't take that persistent. You should remove it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there was no damage taken. What? No.

No, I see the effect. Just give me a sec, folks. There was splash damage, I thought, right?

You did take the splash damage. That's been... Hey, hey, you did take the splash damage.

That's been resolved. Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Great. Okay. Does this thing in the middle, it's called a ghost light, does it have eyes?

It's just a loot object.

[Speaker 2]
That's what the chest thing is for.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, it's a loot object. Okay. I think I will...

The cone effect, if I have a cone effect, it won't, a visual cone effect, how...

[Speaker 2]
Like I said, just ping the feature that you're trying to do here.

[Speaker 3]
That's going to make the output answering a lot faster. Is this one, would this one be completely covered by it? Please ping the feature.

It's a...

[Speaker 2]
The way you do that is you, on your sheet, whatever feature you're trying to ping, you hover over it, there should be... Okay, so I'm going to ask one more time, please ping the feature. Is that all you got to do?

[Speaker 8]
I did.

[Speaker 2]
Please. Okay, maybe it's just not loading.

[Speaker 1]
Hang on.

[Speaker 2]
I hit the targeting button.

[Speaker 3]
Is that what I'm supposed to hit?

[Speaker 1]
I posted it in voice of how to ping it. You've got to hover over the thing and then click it.

[Speaker 3]
I thought you were telling me to target the creature. So would this creature be... I thought you were telling me to target it, not ping it.

[Speaker 2]
I need you to find the feature.

[Speaker 1]
I need you to hover over it and click that little chat bubble, please. Post it to chat, basically. So that we can read it.

[Speaker 3]
It's a... It's a fishing cone. Where's the...

I don't...

[Speaker 2]
Not saying the name of the feature makes this take a lot longer because at this point I could...

[Speaker 3]
A dazzling, dazzling... I said dazzling flash. Dazzling flash.

[Speaker 11]
Here we go.

[Speaker 3]
I just wanted to ask if this creature has cover from like a 15-foot cone. From where you're standing.

[Speaker 2]
The visual, so... I think that you could... So this is another one of these areas where if you pop it and then roll it, first, I can always add it to the target later and stuff like that.

It just goes way, way faster. So I would say, yeah, you could probably hit that within 15.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm going to just do those two and do dazzling flash. And it says I don't have any focus points.

[Speaker 1]
You should always start with one.

[Speaker 3]
Do I only have one? I should have three because I have a lot of domain spells. But it's not like...

[Speaker 1]
If you have three pits at the top, then you should have started with all three of those filled.

[Speaker 3]
I think I may have accidentally, while I was trying to figure out what the character sheet does, I may have accidentally marked those as spent. And now it's making me do the focusing activity to get them again.

[Speaker 2]
I can just press on the little thing there. And I've already applied the saves and stuff like that to these guys.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
So dazzling flash.

[Speaker 2]
Just briefly, is there anything else you'd like to do with your turn?

[Speaker 3]
I just hit the guy in front of me. And if he's blinded, then that'll dazzle them. I don't see an immunity to visual.

They still have tremor sense.

[Speaker 4]
If they don't have a standard vision, they are immune to visual.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, we're learning now. Their tokens have eyes, so I kind of made an assumption.

[Speaker 8]
Anyway, it's still ahead, I think.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, the spider.

[Speaker 2]
That's a spider, right? That's correct. So go ahead and click the damage.

Any time that you hit, you want to click that as quickly as possible so I can apply it.

[Speaker 1]
So strictly speaking, if they're not immune to visual effects, if they have other senses, they're immune to visual debuffs that apply from only being able to see.

[Speaker 2]
Were you aiming for the vine lasher or were you aiming for the hunting spider?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I was aiming for... Sorry, I didn't mean to have that. I was aiming for the spider.

The spider's the one in front of me. I still haven't targeted from making that mistake. How do I untarget something?

There it is.

[Speaker 2]
You just mouse over it.

[Speaker 3]
Spider's dead. Reactions.

[Speaker 2]
Move on to the vine lasher. I'm going to move the spider corpse off for a second. I do not.

I feel like I've got to move over anyways. It's a miss. That's a miss.

And that's its turn.

[Speaker 6]
I could get into flanking, but I don't like the idea of being there, so...

[Speaker 1]
If you wanted to get over to here, I could get into flanking here with you.

[Speaker 6]
And that puts you in the firing line for all the plants. I think it's smart if we create these things.

[Speaker 1]
So I actually don't mind being in the firing line for these plants. I have decent AC, I have resistance to slashing.

[Speaker 6]
If you insist. I mean, better to kill them fast, you know. So there's no cover from this position if I were to strike with my halberd, correct?

[Speaker 11]
Where are you at?

[Speaker 6]
Not here. Not from that thing, though. Okay, I'll stride there and then strike twice.

[Speaker 10]
It's a good map strike. Hey! And that's me.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! You hit twice, there we go. I just scrolled for a second.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, it's just dead, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, that's me.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's another blindlasher. Okay. Damn, the deal was last time.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Restrike. Oh, we hit this time.

[Speaker 1]
Ouchie. That's not slashing damage. That's not me, it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's not.

[Speaker 1]
You're gonna die in the tutorial section. I have medicine, I could stabilize you.

[Speaker 4]
My first action, I'll stand up. And then with my last two actions, I'll cast heal. On Palutene.

[Speaker 11]
Yay.

[Speaker 4]
Second rank spell.

[Speaker 1]
That is a juicy heal.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, that's back to full for me.

[Speaker 2]
Since it's targeted on you, you can put the... there we go.

[Speaker 1]
That's six more than you needed.

[Speaker 3]
What's your health? My health is 28. I don't know how to use these fancy tools.

I just updated my points manually. Because I'm a simple lady.

[Speaker 4]
That's the end of my turn. Did you use one action or a three action? Two actions.

CC was sitting down in the corner, so he stood up with his first action. With his two actions, he cast heal. The single target, with a range of 30 feet.

[Speaker 11]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I respect that.

[Speaker 4]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 6]
That's good roleplay.

[Speaker 4]
If you play with me more, you'll find out that I will commit to things to our detriment greatly. So, good luck.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I... That one's healthy. Is it?

Oh, shoot.

[Speaker 2]
I thought it was dead for some reason.

[Speaker 4]
Got scared when the penguin stood up.

[Speaker 11]
Real.

[Speaker 3]
My characters always get really stupid when I'm tired. And I'll just do things.

[Speaker 1]
See, that's why I don't play high intelligence characters. Because I'm not a high intelligence person. Oh, shoot.

I will...

[Speaker 3]
I can double click to minimize a window. Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see. I think I'm going to... attempt to trip this one.

So, let me... where is it? TTT, there it is.

There you go.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then I will weapon infuse... Agile. And do a two-action blast.

Wait, is that... That is... yeah, that is applying correctly.

There you go. Roll damage. Minimum damage.

God, I love it. Get myself that. Okay.

That is my turn. Beautiful, beautiful.

[Speaker 11]
Outside...

[Speaker 2]
Let's find out when they appear.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, lovely. Oh, yeah. Time to go pew-pew.

So... Last action loaded a... acid round.

So I'm going to go a little pew-pew at this guy.

[Speaker 11]
Damage.

[Speaker 9]
And did that roll it like it should?

[Speaker 11]
Oh, my god.

[Speaker 9]
Don't worry about it.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, it...

[Speaker 9]
Everyone takes one acid damage.

[Speaker 1]
The plus one should be... The plus one untyped bonus acid should be splash. I will just manually...

Yeah, just do a manual minus one.

[Speaker 9]
It is.

[Speaker 1]
Who keeps closing the door?

[Speaker 9]
Me! I'm trying to target people.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we already... we already...

[Speaker 9]
I'm going to reload up a fire shot. Call it.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, we've got a gorgoyle. He's going to fly in. I'm going to slightly off...

Just to mark him as...

[Speaker 1]
A little bit off the ground. Ah, they're flying above the creature, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Not actually ten feet. That's just for... Just mark it as five, but it'll keep them above.

Without too many shenanigans. I definitely said shift. I'm going to have to do it this way.

Who has the better... I'm going to do that one first.

[Speaker 1]
Hey! You really like hitting palatine, huh? I hit...

I miss palatine with both of the hunting spider attacks.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, targeting palatine.

[Speaker 1]
Targeting palatine is a better word.

[Speaker 11]
No, no, you were right.

[Speaker 1]
He likes hitting.

[Speaker 6]
He missed twice, so we had to get to hit them.

[Speaker 2]
I like targeting palatine. I like hitting Josh. If my revealed...

If we can take the rolls... And which ones actually succeed to be part of my revealed references.

[Speaker 1]
You mean the two that you just succeeded against palatine, those ones? Yeah, that's the first time. Ah, that's not the first time, because they needed to be healed up.

Well, the first time was a trap, and that was my fault.

[Speaker 3]
That was learning how Pathfinder works. You need to be seeking, or you'll run into a trap.

[Speaker 1]
What did I hit with last time, though? Is that the one I should... Unless you're a rogue, at which point you can take Trapfinder and automatically seek it.

Without needing to do it.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm going to trust that I will be healed. Well, I actually... I'm going to mark Prey on this guy, because he looks very, very strong.

[Speaker 6]
Can I propose that we move back and force Divine Lashers to pursue us?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was going to do that next time, don't worry.

[Speaker 3]
If we want to run, I could just mark Prey and start taking off instead.

[Speaker 1]
You could mark Prey, strike, and then just run, maybe? Let's not do a turn-by-committee, though. What's the first action on the dock?

[Speaker 3]
Mark Prey. And then... attack?

[Speaker 11]
Strike. Roll damage.

[Speaker 3]
That hits. Damage. Six damage.

Okay, and then I'm going to start moving. And hope I don't get killed by an opportunity attack.

[Speaker 1]
That's the great thing about Pathfinder. Most creatures don't have them. Most players don't have them.

[Speaker 10]
Until you get to high level.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I will just get out of there. And that's my turn. Royal 2.

Hello.

[Speaker 2]
This definitely works for me.

[Speaker 3]
Bring it. My original plan was to step, because I'm used to everyone having opportunity attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Hey! Who better? Oh, you're going to hit Kali.

Dude, you just don't want to hit me. What is this?

[Speaker 2]
You're the only one that I managed to hit for a couple of...

[Speaker 1]
No, I've not taken a single hit. Really? I've taken two damage, and it's from Splash.

You haven't targeted me with a single attack so far.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just go after the... The... The glass cannon type.

That makes... I mean, it's a smart tactic.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I have 36 max hit points at level 2, so you know.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I got it.

[Speaker 2]
My flying lasher. Pretend we target you, instead of... Instead of Palutene, instead of me.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you were targeting Palutene. You were targeting me.

[Speaker 3]
I'm still far away. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, let's... I'm going to take a crack at this guy, see what happens.

[Speaker 4]
Well done.

[Speaker 8]
Does he have anything?

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah. Oh, I'm thinking of constructs.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Very good.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, those things look strong.

[Speaker 6]
You're killing me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I should have... I wish I thought of that. Ah.

[Speaker 6]
What else have we got for actions? Okay, well... We established there's no opportunity attack, which sounds good to me, so...

I'm going to fall back. There. Yeah.

Come on.

[Speaker 2]
Make sure that you're not on the... Hey, there we go.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, fall back there. Hunt the one I just attacked, and get my recall knowledge with Wild Nimic Lore. Which is in here somewhere.

Nothing. Very well. That's it.

Oh yeah, this poor guy.

[Speaker 2]
Now there's no getting away. I was going to say, am I finally going to get hit with an attack?

[Speaker 11]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Holy Hyrule. But...

[Speaker 3]
This happens to be several times where, like, there's me, and then there's a tank, and everyone attacks me instead of the tank.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but you do be running high against me. You took it personally.

[Speaker 2]
Counts towards... Ooh, I could have made my second action grapple. So I'm going to do that.

Normally gives me the option to... to grab after... That's rough.

[Speaker 1]
Imagine trying to grab a creature with a fucking maxed out fort. Alright, CC.

[Speaker 4]
My first action I'll stride to hit. My second I'll cast Fire Array at the... at the lower.

Needs a hero point on that. GG. My curse goes to...

What?

[Speaker 1]
You are targeting me.

[Speaker 4]
Is a 17 hit that guy? I am targeting Palutene. No, it's not hitting.

No, why? Changes nothing. Palutene misses my wrath.

[Speaker 11]
Why? Why only if it comes to you?

[Speaker 4]
I end my turn after missing my spell. Easy.

[Speaker 1]
Average caster.

[Speaker 4]
Grail?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not even... This is why I don't play casters.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it's a penalty. No, I am going to stand up. Oh, fine.

[Speaker 1]
I don't have a reactive strike, so...

[Speaker 2]
Trying to figure out... I'm not used to prone inflicting penalties on your attacks. So I was like, eh, maybe I just attack three times.

[Speaker 1]
There's absolutely no point in this creature. I mean, there's no point in attacking three times for those creatures anyway. Map just makes you so useless.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to move the devil on out of the way.

[Speaker 1]
An evil 20 on every dice, it's true.

[Speaker 11]
Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
Miss. That's a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Was that me? There we go. Move here.

And then use a tremor. And I'm going to place it... Here.

This will give me this, this will deactivate this.

[Speaker 10]
I will roll the damage.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, if you hold shift and then T, what you can do is...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, right, yeah, sorry. Let me do that, and then I will... I already got devil.

I'm going to do...

[Speaker 2]
They got their ski binds? I already got that one. Don't worry.

Yeah, I... Just have to make them do their fort saves.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I'm begging the flying to critically fail. It would hit the flying ones.

There's no specification that they need to be touching the ground. Okay. Ground.

Touch. Then... There are traits and stuff that require you to be touching the ground for it to affect you.

It doesn't have any of those. Reset terrain for these two, and then these two. So hopefully it hits the...

They crit fail and full prone. And then they're no longer flying. No.

Also no.

[Speaker 4]
You have the full spectrum of saves.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Fucking full rainbow. Oh, man.

Wow, that's awesome. I killed that one. This is difficult terrain now.

So I'm gonna leave that there. They're chasing after you one square at a time. Indeed.

[Speaker 9]
Then they fly? Wouldn't they just ignore it?

[Speaker 1]
The flying ones don't care about it. There are more around, so... Yeah, that is my turn.

Beautiful. Let's move and then a two-action impulse. Hey, Ranger.

[Speaker 9]
I feel scared. I'm gonna... Whoops, I just targeted everyone.

I'm gonna waste my elemental shot and just do a normal shot. And that'll be the last of my energy shots through my initiative.

[Speaker 11]
Hmm. Hmm.

[Speaker 6]
You can join us back here.

[Speaker 11]
No, we're gonna kill the gargoyles.

[Speaker 3]
It's gonna be fine. I was hoping to kill the gargoyle, but it doesn't look like I'm gonna do it.

[Speaker 9]
I'm gonna load up an acid shot and run through the door.

[Speaker 3]
They're scraped and banged up.

[Speaker 9]
We got this. I didn't do much damage to it.

[Speaker 1]
They are a little scary. It looks like they might have resistance to precision. Okay.

Anything else on your turn? No, not precision.

[Speaker 9]
Nope, that's my turn.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, we're ready.

[Speaker 2]
What do we got here? Yeah, I think it's appropriate. He's gonna move out.

Go get some buddies.

[Speaker 3]
Help team. Okay, well, that guy left. I guess I'll...

mark prey again on the next guy. This one. And go ahead and do my...

my Vindicator's Mark. Oh, critical miss! Everybody starts with a hero point, so if you wanted to, you could right-click.

Oh, yes! I will... hero point.

Wait, no, I gave myself a hero point. Oops.

[Speaker 2]
You can just right-click. Just right-click on the... Sorry, on the chat message for your attack roll.

[Speaker 3]
Right-click on the chat. Reroll to keep the new result?

[Speaker 1]
It's reroll with hero point.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, reroll with hero point. I just manually deleted the hero point and did it.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead and click roll damage, and then we're good to go.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the damage button didn't show up. It's right above the...

[Speaker 11]
Oh, there it is.

[Speaker 3]
It didn't show up on the re... I was looking at the reroll attack. All right, five...

Five the spirit damage. And now, if I hit it again, it'd do more.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 8]
Yay. That's it.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, I'm going to return... It's going to flee as well. I'm going to end the combat encounter.

[Speaker 1]
Let me delete my... There we go. At the end of the encounter, I'm going to re-up my elemental thing.

My geological attunement. That was good. Defeated.

Do we want to spend some time healing up with medicine kits?

[Speaker 4]
You can cast a heal spell.

[Speaker 11]
I would like that.

[Speaker 1]
If we want to do it quickly, you could cast a heal spell. But do we want to save those?

[Speaker 4]
We're pretty good still. I'll cast a heal so we can see how we're doing after.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. I'll hit everybody with a three-action heal. A five.

I'm searching for a GM. That chest icon, was that obvious loot we could go and grab real quick?

[Speaker 2]
Or do we have to search? So if you double-click on loot icons, you can actually...

[Speaker 1]
We're both doing the thing. Ah, it's 70 silver. That's seven gold.

[Speaker 2]
What you could do at any time is send this to the party stash for later splitting it up.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, that's hard to split between five people.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we should wait for someone to die.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Are we able to pick up and grab that? Yeah.

I mean, you say we should wait for somebody.

[Speaker 2]
Do you guys have the button on the side that says send to party stash?

[Speaker 1]
No. Okay. You can open the party stash and then just drag it over.

Anybody can, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I have a button that says send to party stash. I think that just yanks everything in there. That does, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So I'm going to quickly make off with that before they bring friends or whatever.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Well, what do we want to do now?

[Speaker 3]
I kind of want to refocus.

[Speaker 1]
We could spend some time healing up so that they can refocus.

[Speaker 3]
I'm also still at half health, so it'd be good to get some medicine for me.

[Speaker 1]
You get the heal that's in chat as well. Yeah, I added that. I'm still at 12 out of 28.

Okay. There is a heal button on the healing and that would mean that it would just do it automatically so you wouldn't have to do the math next time. Oh, okay.

It just makes it easier for you. So do we want to spend some time doing some trait wounds checks while Palutene refocuses? Does that sound good with everybody?

[Speaker 4]
I'd like to refocus as well, so that sounds good.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Actually, I might need to go within half an hour. Is it alright if I drop out now?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's totally fine. I was going to have a hard drop in at the end of this, so that works out well.

[Speaker 9]
Alright, perfect. Thank you. I wish you all the best of luck.

[Speaker 1]
Am I good to roll a trait wounds check on myself? If you haven't already, then... Okay, refocus.

It's just a ten minute activity. Ten minutes, gain a focus point back.

[Speaker 4]
Just sent it to chat, James. Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I have to add that to my actions, that's...

[Speaker 2]
Can usually refocus while pretending to be... Now, where are you?

[Speaker 1]
Each class or subclass will have different specifications on what they do when refocusing, but most, if not all, is like, oh, you meditate on the purpose of something, something.

[Speaker 3]
Meditate on my goddess.

[Speaker 11]
So it's usually...

[Speaker 1]
And then treat wounds is... Also a ten minute activity.

[Speaker 2]
So that's a separate activity.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. So if I am to treat wounds on myself, then they can spend the ten minutes that I'm treating on refocusing instead, as a separate activity for themselves. Paladin needs to refocus, CC needs to refocus.

So if I spend ten minutes treating wounds, then they can... Oh, I'm treating wounds on myself.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So... Oh, I need to select my tokens.

[Speaker 2]
I heard somebody asking if they could treat wounds and refocus at the same time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh... I don't think anybody did. Yeah, I think that was just...

I'm crazy. Voices mixing together, creating auditory distortion. Probably.

You're not crazy. It's a thing that every human will do if there's multiple inputs of audio.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just goated. Did anyone get a...

[Speaker 3]
I think I'm proficient in this, and I could try treating wounds on myself if we have another ten minutes.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not... Oh, I'm not. Yeah, if we want to spend 20 minutes, then you can probably treat wounds on yourself if you want.

[Speaker 3]
I am not trained in medicine. I am, but... I figured someone would be the most injured person, and didn't think I'd need to...

Heh heh heh.

[Speaker 1]
As a general rule, I find that most of the characters that I make nowadays are at least trained in medicine with a healer's toolkit. Yeah. It's just so nice to have in emergency.

[Speaker 11]
Mm-hmm. Like...

[Speaker 1]
Um... There's no one gonna... Okay, so we spent ten minutes.

CC refocused, you refocused, I did a treat wounds. What do we want to do for the next ten minutes? Does a ranger treat anybody's wounds?

I don't want to sound selfish, just... I was gonna say, I think rangers should.

[Speaker 4]
He's also a gunslinger, so I don't even know if he has medicine trained. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Um... I'm gonna just ask... I'm just gonna ask Josh nicely if you could check my injuries.

Uh...

[Speaker 4]
I don't think we should wait in the dungeon for an hour, I'm just gonna cast heal.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Great. How many more have you got?

[Speaker 4]
I've got two rank twos, and three first ranks if I used all of my spell slots on heal. But I could do that, because I have my focus points for fiery.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well that's fully healed up. Where is...

Okay, Kali is over here.

[Speaker 6]
I am morbidly interested in wherever those things came from. Honestly, same.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like now that we have knowledge that they exist, it would be easier to fight them. Like, they're only flying above the ground. So, like, I could try and trip them.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Because I can reach that, and they would fall, and not be flying.

[Speaker 4]
If Heart joins us, we can regroup and then maybe follow them?

[Speaker 3]
I'm also good at tripping. I haven't tried doing that yet. Do you have a two-handed weapon?

I do. But I'm a monkey, so it doesn't matter.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, do you have...

[Speaker 3]
I have climbing tail, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, does that let you trip with a tail as well?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Nice. I can trip, and I think I can climb with no hands at all.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, because you gain combat climber, and you can also climb with a hero.

[Speaker 3]
And then I reduce the number of hands I need by one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you reduce it from one to zero.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, which is why she's barefoot in the character sheet, because you gotta be. Not character sheet, character art. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Furry question. Do you guys need the bonus healer?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, probably not. Okay. I just get...

[Speaker 3]
I should start playing tanks, because it happens very regularly. So did you just decide... Simply play Guardian.

I was considering Guardian for this character. That might be a good thing. Different game, maybe.

[Speaker 1]
It's a very fun class, I've played it. It's exactly what you want out of being a tank.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I just never... I didn't think of Palutene as a tank, but maybe I should be playing tanks, because people keep targeting me, and I like being in melee.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I've had that issue in my Taric Kingmaker campaign. Taric is still progressing.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Hey, let's go check out this highly dangerous hole in the wall.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, do we want to regroup with Taric's character first? Yeah. We're kind of waiting on hearts, I think.

Since we did get left by the ranger, who is not playing a ranger.

[Speaker 7]
Since we might need more firepower, but don't need healers. Here we go.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, hell yes, love Nina.

[Speaker 7]
That feels good to hear.

[Speaker 2]
Make sure Nina rests.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god, yes, you're correct. Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
I'm assuming they were pretty hurt last time you...

[Speaker 4]
You don't know the start of it.

[Speaker 3]
That's fun. I like Nina.

[Speaker 1]
They're pretty cool. Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
Alrighty, I'll just... Dragon Breath them to you guys. Oh!

[Speaker 1]
I'm fucking with that first line of the backstory.

[Speaker 11]
I'm inside. Oh, I forgot I wrote that, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
So good. It's very fun. Oh me, for real.

Okay, so we saw them come through here. I assume we can... Also, holy shit, it's so bright.

Oh my god.

[Speaker 7]
There's only supposed to be one, and I can't see any on my screen.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, it glows in the dark. It was so bright because there was two of them, and they were overlapping the light. So it was just white on my screen.

[Speaker 7]
If you don't mind, please delete one of them. I'll wait until she loads them for you.

[Speaker 1]
They did. Thanks. Yeah, I assume we can see through here.

That way.

[Speaker 2]
There's a hole beneath here, and then there's a set of windows.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Are we able to get through this floor?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, what was your question? Are we able to get through this wall? It's a window.

Okay, so we can climb through it. Yeah, you can climb through it.

[Speaker 3]
And there's enough space for us to stand on the rock parts?

[Speaker 1]
I assume this is just shallow water.

[Speaker 4]
No, it's a hole. It is deep. It is a hole.

Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, how far is there enough space to... I am not trained in acrobatics.

[Speaker 3]
I have steady balance, but if I go in alone, that's not going to work out very well.

[Speaker 4]
Can I just climb through and get in the water?

[Speaker 1]
It's not water. I mean, I can swim. Wait, is it a hole or is it water?

[Speaker 4]
No, you guys are trolling me.

[Speaker 2]
It's all right.

[Speaker 1]
Wait. It looks like water.

[Speaker 2]
That's okay. It remains not water. It's not.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. I repeat, how deep does the pit look?

[Speaker 2]
If you have darkvision, then it's...

[Speaker 1]
I actually don't know how to describe this.

[Speaker 2]
I have darkvision. Oh wait, I can put it in the party sheet.

[Speaker 1]
I have darkvision.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to know, I want to be able to go look and see how far out it goes and stuff like that. Low light vision, darkvision. Oh, it doesn't show me the range.

[Speaker 4]
They don't have a range.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so everything... So you can just see. Yep.

[Speaker 11]
Looks about...

[Speaker 2]
Whatever the height of this level is going down into water about 60 feet down.

[Speaker 3]
So... 80? Ah, lovely.

Well, that's fine. If I were to... My acrobatics is low, but I have steady balance and a climb speed.

Not a climb speed. I'm good at climbing. Good...

If I were to get across here and get a rope and tie it from one side to the other side, would that help people jimmy across?

[Speaker 2]
It's good for catching the edge if somebody falls or something like that.

[Speaker 3]
Cool. Is there anywhere to affix... Can I affix a rope to this window?

Is there a point where I can do that? Yeah, I mean, there's a space between the two windows.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, I could use base kinesis to create a stake of stone that they could affix it to.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So... I think we have the window gap. That's good.

Save that for later. I'm going to tie the rope to that. And I think...

But I have to roll at acrobatics to balance and avoid falling in this area. To get across. That would be fine.

Can I climb? Can I climb instead? Why did you ask?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Do you have a climb speed? What have we got?

[Speaker 3]
I have a climbing... I have a plus two bonus to athletics. Check the climb.

My athletics is better. Okay. You could do that instead.

Yeah, if you have to roll either way, then you can do so. I'll go ahead and roll and do my climbing.

[Speaker 1]
Climb is in the basic action macro, for the record. Oh, it is? Yes.

Yay.

[Speaker 3]
I have been... For 12 years, I have been rolling physical dice and doing math. So all these tables and everything are super new.

Here's climb. Roll, plus 10.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good roll.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. You make it over?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I make it over. I have the rope. Is there another gap?

Actually, before I get all the way over, could I look and see at the room and see if I'm going to be climbing through the window into a room full of enemies?

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
It could be just sick. Just peek. Just peek.

I'm very... I'm behind cover. There is another ghost light in the middle of the room.

Okay. I'm going to go ahead and just get through there and affix... I can't get...

It's not letting me go to that spot. I want to tie the rope to the gap in the windows again. And then...

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And after I climb through, I'm going to just...

[Speaker 1]
I'm anxiously watching to see if they make it across.

[Speaker 6]
Is that right? Yeah. Is there an air outranger?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't have opposable thumbs, so... Rough.

[Speaker 3]
That is rough, yeah. Someone might need to... I might need to come back and carry the penguin.

[Speaker 7]
I'll be looking through the other doors to make sure nothing sneaks up on us.

[Speaker 10]
Question.

[Speaker 1]
Would I be able to do a jump from here to here? At this point, do you guys have the rope up so you could just...

[Speaker 2]
I mean, under normal circumstances... Would I have been able to?

[Speaker 1]
Probably. If I came up with that idea before now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. It'd be risky in some aspect.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know exactly how, but... I can... Yeah, I can, like, be ready to catch you on the other side if you need to.

Well, we have the rope now, so it doesn't matter, because I'll just use the rope to stable myself to get across. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to come back and I'm going to ask the penguin if I may carry them across if they would like me to.

[Speaker 11]
I'll be fine to climb over when we all go.

[Speaker 1]
Are we able to cross without a check with the rope? Or do we still need to check?

[Speaker 2]
I'm fine with you guys if you're going one at a time.

[Speaker 3]
Cool. I didn't know if the penguin would need help. So, let's see here.

Who was the first one in the door?

[Speaker 1]
Or in the window?

[Speaker 2]
Probably me?

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, assuming it's not Palutene, it would be me. Alright, so you would have been... Because I would have to stay...

I would help everyone else across the rope, so I'd probably actually be last.

[Speaker 3]
So I'm helping people get inside and making sure no one falls.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it would be me.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it'll be you. First one.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody add yourselves to initiative.

[Speaker 11]
Ah! Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Here I thought we'd be walking past lava repeatedly until nothing happened. Nina's here though, so it's all good.

[Speaker 7]
I appreciate the knife on me.

[Speaker 11]
Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not as much of a fan as Nessie's child is, but I'm still a big fan of Nina.

[Speaker 3]
I finally rolled a roll that makes sense for how high my initiative is. Yay!

[Speaker 1]
That's cool. Oh! What was that?

[Speaker 2]
It's a toony bear. That's good.

[Speaker 1]
That'll make me a couple reflexes. Is this versus a prune effect?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And I get a bonus to that from being a rock dwarf.

[Speaker 11]
Rock dwarf.

[Speaker 4]
Wolves are so based.

[Speaker 11]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Palantine is short, strong, and Scottish, so she's basically just a dwarf who's in a different den.

[Speaker 2]
You look at the card, and there's that little button there. See where Josh has that 19 for their results, blue? Right above that, you could click that button as a reflex save and throw just for future ones.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Does that automatically tell you? Which side of the door would y'all like to be in? Or the window, in this case.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, here. Sorry. It'd be inside.

[Speaker 2]
What about you, Palantine?

[Speaker 8]
Well... I think I...

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna stay where I am. You're inside the door right now. Okay, I'm here.

You're either in or out. You'd be out.

[Speaker 2]
That's totally fine. That was a benefit of succeeding the save. You could be on...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can choose to be in or out. You were in the middle of the door, say. Well, that's because...

Listen, we're not pixel-bitching. This isn't like a... Oh, okay.

Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
You said make a quick decision, and I did. Apologies. No worries, no worries.

Some groups are different about that, so I don't begrudge you that at all.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I've... I've had many a DM be like that. Why isn't it on the right side?

[Speaker 3]
I used to be...

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
I used to be like that, but I got better. When I was... When I was like...

15... Like, 15 to 19, I was a toxic-as-fuck person and player. Honestly, Sam.

So many people should have kicked me from their groups and didn't.

[Speaker 1]
Should we go? Is this door locked right now? The...

This window is locked, yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Locked behind us.

[Speaker 1]
What is it made out of?

[Speaker 2]
Glass and bars.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
An ancestral echo. Good thing they're not my ancestors, or I wouldn't be allowed to kill them.

[Speaker 1]
I was gonna say, they might be my ancestors.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you have a swearing-in-the-most to respect here. Oh, you're not under oath.

[Speaker 2]
That's true. Give me just a second. It's not...

It's not letting me get rid of Encumbered or Ponzi or anything.

[Speaker 1]
So, I have to... You could manually adjust the Encumber limit.

[Speaker 2]
That's not cooperating. Ah, fuck. That's alright.

I'm just gonna move it over.

[Speaker 11]
Hey, there we go. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I was about to take that, but thank you.

[Speaker 11]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
What did we get for the last one?

[Speaker 11]
You know what?

[Speaker 2]
I am going to... We are going to put this on here.

[Speaker 8]
I would...

[Speaker 3]
I think Josh has beautified this site, because he is a very beautiful man.

[Speaker 11]
No!

[Speaker 3]
Well... I go up. And I...

Actually... Yeah, I'm just gonna... Keep simple and fast.

I just run up. Murkbray, attack. Keep us up.

Oh, it's in the exploration. It's going this way. I can't find my katana.

I forgot to target them. So that's... Oh!

They take four damage... Oh, boy. Yeah, there was a stack of...

Encumber... Chains. Welp.

Uh, no. Okay. Go ahead and...

Find my Murkbray effect.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. That's it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we're all gonna die.

[Speaker 2]
This one's pretty easy. By the way, some flanking.

[Speaker 3]
And it's me, again!

[Speaker 1]
That's rough. That's pretty rough. Oh, that's one hit point for me.

[Speaker 2]
Minus ten? No, no, no. It's not minus ten.

[Speaker 1]
Are you gonna roll damage on this thing? Give me just a moment. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I thought 27 was the damage.

[Speaker 1]
No, 27 was the to hit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
What's... Oh, jeez. I can't just, uh, add...

That's how I have to do it. Alright, sorry about that. We're stuck with the fact that they are...

They're ghostly.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. This is not too bad for a crit. Could be worse.

Or maybe I'm too used to playing high level.

[Speaker 2]
That... Give me just a sec.

[Speaker 11]
Damage... Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, that was it. Alright. Like I said, I'm probably just too used to playing at high level.

[Speaker 2]
Where you get, like, 50 damage shots. Oh, critical miss. And then we'll reload.

His turn. Now to one of the gargoyles. Oh, no.

Appear from below and say hello.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the gargoyles go that way.

[Speaker 11]
Shit.

[Speaker 3]
We wanted to fight. I can only attack those three people. I didn't realize there was stuff over there.

Oh, god.

[Speaker 2]
With the moves, that's it. We come now to Mina.

[Speaker 10]
Who is muted.

[Speaker 7]
Actually, hold on. Can I just... I can't reach over there.

Sick. Wait. No, that's 15 feet.

Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Target. That way back.

[Speaker 7]
To entrance. And then we'll just strike it regularly.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! It hits.

[Speaker 7]
And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Who's gargoyle? This one. Move him up here.

Through the window? Through the second window. There are two windows.

[Speaker 1]
Where are they flying in from? Wait, didn't they lock behind us? The one locked behind you.

Oh. That was not very clear. That's my bad.

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't matter which one he gets shut in on, because he's yelling. Or whether he succeeds or not, because... He'll just get pushed in anyways.

Pretty simple. Three roll for jaws.

[Speaker 10]
Ow! Okay. Three roll for claws.

[Speaker 1]
Another hit. And I'm down. Okay.

Hit. Nice.

[Speaker 4]
Nine damage. Resistant to slashing. One HP.

[Speaker 10]
Holy moly. I am up.

[Speaker 4]
I am up. Because of the fucking... James, give them a hero point.

I give you a point for that. That's the fucking movie. Holy.

I got the fucking armor special. Slashing. That's so good.

[Speaker 10]
What the fuck? Holy.

[Speaker 6]
Oh wait, there's more.

[Speaker 2]
Mr. President.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's a side ancestral echo. And I'm probably completely burned.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, we can just apologize. Don't let us go. Not a bad idea.

[Speaker 7]
Are we dropping?

[Speaker 4]
They told us not to go up, and then off. Oh, wait a second.

[Speaker 2]
Let me select wild by disrespect. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
I thought that we were hunting down dangerous gargoyles who had infested their lair. That was my plan. Should have picked a dwarf deity.

That might have helped.

[Speaker 11]
My bad.

[Speaker 3]
There's so many of them.

[Speaker 7]
Would reactive strike work here?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a ranged weapon?

[Speaker 11]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Then yeah. There we go.

[Speaker 11]
Weapon time.

[Speaker 2]
Pity. That reminds me. Why did you move within 5 feet of this guy?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, because it's 15 feet away from where I was when I was over here.

[Speaker 1]
I couldn't reach.

[Speaker 7]
Because my reach is 10, not 5.

[Speaker 4]
Not 15. Let's go find Pythagoras and kill him. True.

I'm going to agree. Next time you'll be hit by... Next time.

It's quite below it. I don't think so. In a chase, it's quite below it.

Oh, they're up 5 feet. Yep, my bad. They should just actually rotate near 90 degrees, so...

Everything in front of us now.

[Speaker 2]
I think it makes... First of all, this makes total sense. That is it's turn.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I'm no expert, but I have a sub 50% chance of hitting these things. So that seems pretty bad for me.

[Speaker 1]
What do you all want to do? I mean, I would like to run, but I don't think I can.

[Speaker 2]
Two of them are still beat up from the encounter earlier.

[Speaker 6]
They are, but that doesn't matter if I can't hit.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have anything to make it more likely to hit them?

[Speaker 3]
You could... What if we tricked one of them? I was going to say, if you trick one, they just fall into a pit.

[Speaker 6]
They fall...

[Speaker 2]
80 feet into some water.

[Speaker 6]
I'm getting tangled up in meta stuff in my head, because if they're AC, is that item chamber also pretty high? Probably. But...

So... That goggles.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to get meta, that reflector... So tripping still probably isn't a bad idea.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not so sure, but...

[Speaker 1]
If you do trip, they fall 85 feet, so...

[Speaker 6]
There's a reaction. I will let them take pretty much.

[Speaker 2]
Let's... No more peanut gallery. What do you want to do?

[Speaker 6]
Trying to figure that out. I might actually go with the Apologize strategy, try calling out to the Anti-Astrologos. Uh...

Last time we used... Dwarvish. I'm going to take a pot shot and see if they understand Sackroth.

[Speaker 11]
Go ahead and drop a...

[Speaker 2]
A Diplomacy Jug.

[Speaker 6]
That looks fine. It'll be worth.

[Speaker 2]
And a Cigar. They got two actors, bud.

[Speaker 6]
They do. We have one more go.

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm sorry. It's not gonna... I'll let you take that action back.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I think the smart thing to do is fall back here.

[Speaker 2]
One of the things, they don't understand that language.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Understood that. For the sake of pretending like I'm trying to help.

So, first action, attempt Diplomacy. Free action, take a hand off my Halberd, so I have a hand for you to do a trip attempt. On this Gargoyle Raiden.

Can I see which one's more damaged?

[Speaker 2]
Injured, I think it's more damaged. I'm gonna go for the tougher one.

[Speaker 6]
Somewhere in here. Yeah. Again.

Sorry, guys.

[Speaker 4]
No, don't apologize.

[Speaker 1]
I was gonna say, I feel like I'm pretty dead, and I have one strategy.

[Speaker 2]
Did you want to hero point that? If you haven't used yours yet.

[Speaker 6]
I'm saving that. Okay. That was 20.

[Speaker 2]
PC. If you need to move any further, I can help you as well.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, pathways.

[Speaker 4]
How the windows work, I don't have a line of effect to Josh, right? It's just a straight, unbroken line that my spell could travel to him. You do, you do.

It's just the... If I can see Josh, then I'll cast a spell. I'll cast a two-action heal.

[Speaker 2]
The windows work weird in KF2. Not in, um, in Foundry, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Let's heal this dwarf. Spend two actions on a second rank heal.

[Speaker 1]
Please roll high.

[Speaker 4]
That's pretty high. That's pretty good. I healed one of them.

I did not heal the gargoyle. That was an accident. No!

Extrapolating further. Do I have line of sight to the gargoyle next to Josh? Oh, line of effect, sorry.

[Speaker 11]
Alright, I'll cast a fiery at them.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, that's like plus one AC. You would have plus one AC from Josh being there. Sure, I mean from the, uh, from the window.

Uh, might be standard cover then, which is like plus two. I think.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Surely I wouldn't roll terribly twice in a row for this. Sorry, three times, including my hero point. Holy moly, we've done it.

14 damage. Standard cover is just plus two to AC, reflect, stealth.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, very nice.

[Speaker 4]
Immune to fire? No, not immune to fire. Okay.

Try and get its attention and get it to leave Josh alone. Despite all of them hating Josh so much.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so. I don't think, can you see him?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, the ghost. Yeah, I, I have nothing for the ghost. The goggles before were picking on Josh.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
All right, that's my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, here we go.

[Speaker 11]
Do I reload?

[Speaker 2]
How's Josh looking? Maybe I reloaded. You know what?

Demoralize.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Do I need to roll anything for Demoralize?

[Speaker 1]
No, they, they roll a check against your will DC.

[Speaker 3]
My will DC.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's your will save plus ten. It's a success.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Good. Okay, that's it.

That's me, that's me unconscious.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they're unconscious while you're rolling to attack. You're not double tapping them, are you? He's double tapping.

Oh, God. Okay, well.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wow, I'm so excited to try Pathfinder for like the third time in a row. This is going to be so fun. DM immediately kills my character.

Great. Good show.

[Speaker 1]
It happens, it happens.

[Speaker 2]
It does. It's not the first time somebody's died on their first game.

[Speaker 3]
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

[Speaker 1]
I spent time writing lore for this character, so. You could always bring them back in some way. Give them the Revenant background.

Or the ghost art type dedication if you want to retrain them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there you go. It's not a joke, we did that. There's plenty of ghosts here.

[Speaker 1]
There are ways to bring characters back.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, speaking of which, there is a major priest in... There's an archpriestess in Brannoth. She does do resurrections.

I think it's like 75 gold for a first level character, and then...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, well who's gonna pay for that for a random stranger?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hold on a second. I have... I'm gonna roll first.

Alright, he is going to... He's gonna stab at you first.

[Speaker 1]
Come on, man. Fucking chill, bro. Holy.

You have no chill.

[Speaker 2]
There's no reason for that.

[Speaker 1]
Roll the damage. Ow.

[Speaker 2]
What are you doing, bro?

[Speaker 1]
Do you fucking mind? Do you mind?

[Speaker 11]
Yeah, it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Also, you fucking made me take the damage twice again.

[Speaker 2]
Or did you already... No, you clicked the damage button after I clicked the damage button. Well, why are you damaging my character?

Because I shot you. Or sorry, I stabbed you, and that's why.

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, I mean, why are you clicking the damage button? I just do that for people normally. Ow.

[Speaker 2]
That versus you. Gargoyle is also intruding on his territory.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, thank god.

[Speaker 2]
His turn, we have another Gargoyle.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, no, man.

[Speaker 2]
He's gonna bite you. Oh! Oh!

Oh! I'm sending the second one to TC.

[Speaker 4]
How dare you damage me? Because the first one was... I rolled two ones.

Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 11]
Sorry, Nuna.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, it's alright. We're going to see if we can frighten these things. Sign's pointed, hopefully.

Let's just reroll. Why not?

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, with the two on the dice, I think that's a no.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, there we go. If it can take Frightened, it should be at least Frightened 1. Big strike.

[Speaker 1]
They can be Frightened. Splendid. You could attempt an Agile...

You don't have Agile. But you could attempt Trip. You'll know that it's Frightened.

[Speaker 7]
They're kind of in the sky, so...

[Speaker 1]
You have a Reach weapon with Trip.

[Speaker 4]
It'd make them fall to the ground if you Tripped them.

[Speaker 7]
That's true, that's true.

[Speaker 4]
Also, they're only five feet in the ground.

[Speaker 7]
You could stab it.

[Speaker 1]
You could stab it.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, Nina.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, Nina. No, no.

[Speaker 1]
Also, for future reference, anything only... Do you have a Hero Point?

[Speaker 7]
I spent the one I did to stab it the first time.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. For future reference, anything that's only five feet above the ground can actually... Because you have a Reach of five feet.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Well, thank you. I did reckon I could kill it rather than Trip it, but...

[Speaker 1]
Alas. Alas. Okay, I have an idea.

Take off right now. There you go. I am still Frightened.

Wait, am I? Just take it off. Oh, it was the first round.

[Speaker 10]
Just take it off.

[Speaker 1]
Relax. Okay. I have an idea.

It's a little unorthodox. I am going to use Base Kinesis to tidy up this area a bit and then ask them for forgiveness. Would you allow that?

[Speaker 2]
Make a... Diplomacy check with advantage. Okay.

I know that's a 5th edition term, but there is a way to actually go and do the hindsight.

[Speaker 1]
So, keep higher... There we go. 18.

[Speaker 4]
Minus one. I have a minus one. I love that.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it's totally also forgive the people that came in with them, right?

[Speaker 1]
He's not immediately going to attack you. Yay. Okay, well that's my turn.

Because that's two actions for Kinesis and that's one action to ask for forgiveness. So, that is my turn. He's no longer menacing you.

Hell yeah. And this guy. Yeah, that guy is menacing me.

But he's not allied with this guy. This guy has plenty of minutes to go around.

[Speaker 2]
I should have smacked you with clawed feet when you stood up. I didn't stand up.

[Speaker 1]
I also didn't stand up. You didn't stand up? Oh, are you prone right now?

No. What the hell? No, I'm not prone.

I never got prone. I thought I knocked you unconscious. No, I didn't.

Because you were... It's Palatine. Because I was at one.

You were at one, yeah. Yeah, Palatine is prone. Well, I can see that.

[Speaker 3]
Shame on me for not expecting Tutorial and Deadly to exist in the same time. Brutally. Uh, that's...

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's still technically a hit. It's just not... He's not flanking right now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. We can just manually adjust. Yeah, well, we don't have to.

[Speaker 2]
Unless it's like a crit that would have been affected by it.

[Speaker 6]
Take the claw.

[Speaker 11]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
We're on the list of slashing coming in again.

[Speaker 2]
Let's disable... Uh, no, that one says afterwards. Okay.

Tempted to use Force Open. I'm still tempted to use Force Open.

[Speaker 1]
Force Open what? Does Force Open use your multiattack? Uh, yeah, it's an attack, actually.

What would you be forcing open? I will give you two guesses. My armor?

[Speaker 2]
That's one incorrect.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Well, now they're not rolling crits. I mean, I did get one crit against the Gargoyle. That felt good.

[Speaker 1]
They did roll a crit against it before. Okay. That's nice.

Intriguing.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna do Demoralize. Wait, no, that's not it.

[Speaker 1]
That's 1d20.

[Speaker 12]
We have another Gargoyle.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna fly down this way. Go, Nina! Reactive Strike!

What'd she do?

[Speaker 11]
Exhaust!

[Speaker 7]
Please hit. Please hit.

[Speaker 11]
Let's go!

[Speaker 1]
That is a hit.

[Speaker 11]
Nice!

[Speaker 1]
High rolling the damage. It's dead. Let's go.

[Speaker 6]
Huzzah! I have to follow that up. What the heck?

[Speaker 4]
This one's attacking CC, right?

[Speaker 11]
That's the one that attacks CC, yeah. Yup.

[Speaker 6]
I still have a hand off my Halberd, so I'll put that back on and step there. Take a reluctant crack at it. That hits.

[Speaker 4]
Hey. Pythagoras is blocking you with that one that's 15 feet. It's two diagonals.

[Speaker 6]
Each weapon counts. It's diagonals anyway. It does.

[Speaker 2]
It didn't apply a penalty to it.

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 1]
When you look at the math, it shouldn't work.

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm just asking if it applied a penalty. Just making sure that it didn't change the roll. No, it didn't.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, then we are good. Yup, move, two hand, strike, that's it.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have to use Interact to put one hand back on it?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay. Oh, wait.

I didn't mean to do that earlier.

[Speaker 4]
Oops. PC. I'll set another fire ray at this guy next to me.

Oh, yeah, I will do that. Miss. Dear God, I'm rolling awfully.

Fix that.

[Speaker 3]
There we go.

[Speaker 7]
It happens to the best of us.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
So you missed that attack. Any other actions or?

[Speaker 4]
I'll use my last focus point to make it roll a will save. If I roll the damage, it pings the... No.

I've targeted both of them. Fuck, sorry. It is the bottom one of the two pinged that needs to roll.

It says the target takes half damage and no persistent.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Is that the end of your turn? That's my turn. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
And the top of the round is what? Recovery check?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. It's recovery check. It should be above your AC in your character sheet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, there it is. I thought that the top of the round would come back again. Okay.

And I thought that I had been supposed to do something but didn't.

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Okay. An Ancestral Echo.

[Speaker 2]
Do a move, reload, and fire. Sure, why not? I've never rolled this many natural 20s in a session in my life.

Ever.

[Speaker 1]
The dice give us and the dice take us away.

[Speaker 2]
With that threat gone, the other guys are looking at you to get the fuck out. The doors, or the windows, sorry, do unlock.

[Speaker 1]
Am I able to get out through this way, though? Through which way? Through this way, this way.

No.

[Speaker 2]
You can, there is a door there. They are just not happy about you moving through that.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, well.

[Speaker 11]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Ditto for this one. He's gonna step back.

[Speaker 12]
Gargoyle time.

[Speaker 2]
Does he want to flee?

[Speaker 11]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
That's the case.

[Speaker 4]
What does he want to attack?

[Speaker 2]
I think Otter has this, uh, has this, uh, what's it called?

[Speaker 4]
Macro the picks, yeah, it's like fate or god or something, let fate decide.

[Speaker 1]
Let fate decide. Yeah, it's a good macro, I've seen it before.

[Speaker 4]
Just attack the penguin, he's already doing it. Kill the big chicken. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see, I have to select the macro, or I have to select the tokens.

[Speaker 11]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Karma.

[Speaker 2]
We've got jaws, and we've got claws, and we've got missiles on the roof. Bringing us to Luna.

[Speaker 11]
Hello! Uh.

[Speaker 7]
Now we have a very important decision to make. I'll probably go safe, can't leave, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I can, yeah, I can stabilize Palutene. Which is my plan for next round. Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. I'll, uh, I'll go stab the one gargoyle that's menacing us, then. It's a bit far, how close can I get to this thing?

[Speaker 6]
You'll be wary of the reaction. State of reactions, I think?

[Speaker 7]
It's fine, I can do double charge so I can get there and strike without having to use two strides.

[Speaker 6]
I mean the clawed feet that will trigger when you step next to it.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that one, yes, well, what can you do?

[Speaker 1]
I'm attacking, I'm attacking, oh my god. Uh, you have a reach weapon, so you could just move here and not step next to it.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay, all is well then.

[Speaker 1]
Reach, turns out.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I wouldn't even have to use double charge, it would only be one attack.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it'd be one movement and then you can use intimidating blow or something. Reach, turns out, pretty good keyword. Mhm.

[Speaker 11]
And then, one attack.

[Speaker 7]
Oh joy. Nice. How hurt is the thing?

And it's a bit frightened now.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, we got some damage. Oh, not dead yet. Phew, that's pretty much right.

[Speaker 7]
Hm, well, that is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 11]
Yosh.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm going to step here and I'm going to do a, uh, splice. So let me... Oh, hang on, there we go, hopefully that works.

There we go. You are no longer dying, and that's my turn. Okay.

So you are still unconscious, but you are no longer dying. How big are you?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I am, uh, like five feet tall. And I'm at like 90 pounds.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
What is your... I'm medium size.

[Speaker 4]
GM, what is the bulk of a medium creature?

[Speaker 11]
Six.

[Speaker 4]
Plus whatever they carry.

[Speaker 1]
I can carry that while not being encumbered. Well, I'm still, I'm encumbered. I'm not max bulk.

Okay. So... I know where my next turn is.

[Speaker 2]
No, the Ancestral Echoes are not happy that you have not left yet.

[Speaker 1]
Do they see that I'm trying to take this person that is also here away from here? That they just stabbed a whole bunch? Absolutely.

This one's gonna reload.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I'm obviously no longer a threat, so...

[Speaker 1]
What would that have to do with anything?

[Speaker 3]
It has everything to do with anything.

[Speaker 1]
It's the reason they were attacking me. Well, it's not because you're a threat, it's because you're disrespectful. It's got nothing to do with you threatening.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
This is good, like, try to scare... Nope, that's... I don't even know what I just put there.

[Speaker 1]
There you are. Yeah, my will is, like, non-existent.

[Speaker 6]
Will save of plus five. Plus three now. Go away.

Maybe I can deal one more damage if I'm lucky. First thing, hunt the big guy. That's the gargoyle.

Which triggers Recall Knowledge. If applicable, I'd like to use Crafting instead of Wild Mimic Lore. For the expanded options.

[Speaker 2]
Crafting instead of... You have Crafting. Or you're supposed to have Crafting.

I'm gonna have to add that manually.

[Speaker 6]
Give me just a second, let me look at what the bonus is.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you're treating Crafting.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know what I showed you, so...

[Speaker 2]
It didn't, um, it sort of gave me Arcana, Nature, a bunch of other stuff. Nope. Team base.

Yeah, no, this is absolutely... Okay, so, it's a success.

[Speaker 6]
Would you like to know? Can I ask how much HP it has left? What, nine?

Uh, nine. Okay. With that in mind...

I will attempt a Feint on it. Which will get my Outwit bonus.

[Speaker 11]
Nice.

[Speaker 4]
It's been an action to stride. And between my friends, I will cast an Irradiance Torrent with two actions. I'm fairly certain there's a line that fits between them.

Beautiful. That's hitting Nina, but, um...

[Speaker 1]
Success!

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm just bad at... It's all good, I'm gonna roll damage. So they take half of eleven.

Ooh. Oh my goodness.

[Speaker 1]
So they're at four.

[Speaker 4]
I have nothing. So I'll shield with my last action.

[Speaker 1]
Now I just need to survive. Uh, you're no longer dying, so we'll leave you at dying. Stay alive.

Uh, yeah, you would be wounded once.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Does anything else happen on their turn? Nope, they're just unconscious. Okay.

They're not gonna die, but they are unconscious. This one's gonna reload.

[Speaker 11]
Go back here.

[Speaker 2]
Metalon reloads, if he hasn't already. Is it going?

[Speaker 1]
Nina. It's the goggle, isn't it? Oh, it's going for Nina.

Sorry. It's going for Nina.

[Speaker 2]
Heart. Are you gonna be okay?

[Speaker 4]
What do you need them for?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, is Heart, uh, is Heart missing his, um... Sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, Heart would have Reactive Strike. If it steps, it doesn't trigger. You can't step while flying.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's flying. Step is a purely ground-based activity.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that is fantastic news.

[Speaker 1]
You are welcome for my rules lawyer.

[Speaker 4]
God, it's like having a better version of me here, James.

[Speaker 11]
I just, like... Yeah, missed.

[Speaker 1]
So, that also comes with the caveat that you can't, uh, fly while hasted. Because haste is stride only, and stride is only on the ground.

[Speaker 4]
Fly is a weird action. It is.

[Speaker 7]
It's a miss. Nothing happens.

[Speaker 4]
Nothing ever happens.

[Speaker 2]
Nothing ever happens.

[Speaker 7]
Something did happen.

[Speaker 2]
They moved. If he moves, then he will not move.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, cool. So now I can try stabbing it properly this time. That one works.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 7]
It... Okay. Is it dead?

It's dead! Cool. And now I can go rescue my friends.

Are we punching these ghosts?

[Speaker 1]
No. I am getting out of here. I am leaving.

Just let me leave.

[Speaker 3]
I went from completely fine to actually dying in one round. So, don't.

[Speaker 7]
Nina, you have moves left? I do. I have two.

I can hit this ghost. That's what I was asking.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I would say... I would say, I would say just chill or prepare for worst case scenario. You know, just position yourself and hold an action.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's true. Because if you go in there, they're gonna be like, oh, people are still fighting us, so we're gonna, um... Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that's true. We're gonna... So, I will simply make sure you don't die, and I will stand right here.

Ready to stab anyone. How many feet is that?

[Speaker 11]
Huh?

[Speaker 7]
Not too many.

[Speaker 4]
And readying an action is two.

[Speaker 7]
Background thing.

[Speaker 4]
It costs two actions.

[Speaker 1]
Readying an action is two, but it doesn't matter, because they're a fucking fighter with a reach weapon. So they'll just reactive strike anyway. Sure.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, I shall move here and make sure you do not die. I guess then I lose... I lose an action.

That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Hit the pose.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, my turn. I would like... I would like to pick up Palutene on my back, and then leave.

[Speaker 2]
So... How much bulk of equipment... Any actions that you would like to do before this?

[Speaker 1]
No. Okay. I would like to pick them up and leave.

Uh, so... Picking them up will make me incumbent, which will reduce my movement speed to ten feet, which would allow me to get to here with two actions. So, I will pick them up, and move over here.

Okay. So... If I can bring them with me.

Uh... Palutene, if you're able to move your token on top of mine, that would be appreciated. Andromeda.

You need to come through this way, because of the value. You need to... Yeah, because you can't go through walls.

[Speaker 3]
It says it's not my turn, so I can't move.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Where do you want to drop them?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they're on top of me right now. They're on my back. I'm carrying them.

Thank you. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Dwarf is back on the menu, boys.

[Speaker 1]
No! I'm just trying to save my new friend! Why are you doing this?

[Speaker 7]
Guess what?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they do not trigger Reactive Strike effect.

[Speaker 3]
We're trying to leave!

[Speaker 1]
Why are they doing this? They're making us stay and fight them! We're trying to leave!

Because you have still pissed them off. Therefore, they're angry that I'm helping them.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I should have hit it. Ah.

[Speaker 4]
That doesn't trigger Reactive Strike. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It would need to move again. It doesn't trigger from moving into your movement, but moving through it. It has moved in, but it hasn't moved through yet.

I've got good news on that front. Oh, no crit. Should have hit that guy so I had the chance.

I still might go down. Oh, I'm not down! Okay.

Oh, wait. Oh, it's him again.

[Speaker 2]
And he uses Reload.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Does Reloading, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Reloading is a Manipulate action, yes.

[Speaker 4]
Because he doesn't know that you have Reactive Strike.

[Speaker 1]
No, he doesn't! If only you crit, that would have been crazy good. Uh-oh.

That's his turn.

[Speaker 6]
Golly. I... I'm in delay until after the penguin, so I have more time to think.

That's fair.

[Speaker 4]
Very valid.

[Speaker 2]
I had those guys hold actions. That would have been funny. You can delay, by the way, by clicking a little hourglass symbol on...

On the Initiative Tracker, or Counter Tracker. I see. CC.

[Speaker 4]
Now I can heal the ghost.

[Speaker 7]
Hey, now!

[Speaker 4]
No, it's legit, because he's a ghost. You had to learn it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that hurts.

[Speaker 4]
But it doesn't deal damage. It doesn't deal the extra damage for the two actions, though.

[Speaker 1]
If you do a general healing, you know, the three-action one... I need to move to...

[Speaker 4]
Unfortunately, the wall blocks the AoE from where I was.

[Speaker 1]
Now, you could heal me, so that I don't drop our friend into the fucking chasm.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I like that. You're on the other side of the window at this point, as well. Whoops.

Wrong person targeted.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but if I go down, would they go into an adjacent square? Because if they do, and it's randomly chosen...

[Speaker 2]
I'm having you fall forward. Okay. Because I assume that you would, like...

If you had the movement, you would go the extra...

[Speaker 1]
You would be across the window.

[Speaker 4]
All of my good heals have failed.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. That is healing. You're losing.

That is double my health, so...

[Speaker 4]
That's my turn, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
Go forward. Okay, let's move in so I can see this ghost. I'm stuck under the gargoyle.

There we go. I'm going to move him to the dead body pile. Okay.

Pop the ghost. Get my monster hunter. I think I'm above.

I'm going to try using a cultism. Okay. Final action, attempt to demoralize.

I should get my outwit from this. Well, I've done all I can do.

[Speaker 1]
Well, here come the next two. Here they fucking come.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, lucky dorks. Got the unconscious.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, that's pretty good. Let's go. Happy about that.

[Speaker 2]
And then for the one on your back.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 11]
Getting close.

[Speaker 1]
Getting very lucky.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that missed it by one. Lucky for the first time in the session.

[Speaker 1]
Right. We just kind of got completely screwed by being cut off from the rest of the party.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You just have the misfortune of being surrounded by them before me. And also having a less high HP total.

[Speaker 3]
I thought that it'd be fine because I made my armor class as high as it can go. Then everyone hit me with no trouble.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's not what we said. Okay. Well, by disrespect.

Now we're talking. That hits.

[Speaker 4]
So close to a crit. My heal gone.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god. Okay, so it doesn't matter how much damage this deals. You're just going to dined.

[Speaker 3]
Me? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You're wounded one, but you automatically go to dine.

[Speaker 3]
The person who is not doing anything to them and is completely out of commission.

[Speaker 7]
Okie dokie, gang. Ghost dabber. Can ghosts be frightened?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, a lot of them. A lot of them can be. If they're not mindless, they can be frightened.

[Speaker 4]
Yes! Let's go, Nina!

[Speaker 7]
What the fuck? What did you roll? I think the ghost is just dead.

Uh, probably.

[Speaker 4]
Helping him move on.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, next one. Hmm, I guess that's deserved. Only so much luck.

Alright, that is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Give me a hero point if you want to reroll. That was really good.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yes! Actually, I would. I would like to reroll that.

Thank you. One second. I'll use a hero point.

Still a miss.

[Speaker 2]
I take away your hero point.

[Speaker 7]
Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I would like to... Uh, I would like to step here, deposit my dying friend here, and then make an impulse attack roll. One action, melee, impulse.

That is a hit. My damage button is being weird, because I got DM'd at the same time. That is not a lot of damage, because I keep low-rolling.

Uh, if you want to move your character, uh, power team.

[Speaker 4]
James will have to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he says I can't.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, because...

[Speaker 1]
I keep forgetting that, my bad.

[Speaker 2]
If you have any questions between rounds, you can always put those in the public chat. We'll usually see them.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so they should be here, James.

[Speaker 12]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, and then that's my turn, and my friend will go down. Oh, yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Easy. I think it is time for a three-action heal.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it feels that way. That's why I put them down, then.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, so the two ghosts will need to do fort saves. I will ping those first.

[Speaker 2]
Um... You do world damage healing, and that will, uh...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, if I... What? No way!

I'm just gonna delete the character and leave the session.

[Speaker 11]
So, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Funnily enough, it does still, uh, get the... get, uh, friend up. So...

That is true.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, thanks. I am not...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so... Is that gonna work? There we go.

Uh, so if you right-click it, you can, uh, click Apply Healing, and you will no longer be unconscious or dying. There it is.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. So you should not be unconscious or dying anymore. Okay.

No, that's... I did not mean to type that in somebody else's chat. Golly, you're just giving up.

Oh, my golly.

[Speaker 3]
You two care.

[Speaker 1]
Um...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, okay. Um... Switch on Prey Target to this bottom one here.

I will attempt Recall Knowledge using Occultism once more.

[Speaker 11]
Uh...

[Speaker 2]
Definitely... Dwarves are... Dwarves are, uh...

usually better against poison. So a Dwarf Ghost is, uh... going to be weak to poison.

I don't think that's how that works.

[Speaker 6]
All right, guys. Get your poisons. Ha ha ha!

[Speaker 3]
I... I could have had poison. I didn't...

I didn't do that.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, that was one action. Second, I will attempt to Moralize on this guy now. Uh...

And since it's in my melee reach, can I attempt to aid Nina's next strike against it? Ideally using Deception by doing my own painting effect. What's the question?

I would like to prepare to aid Nina's next strike, if possible. Um... It's in your reach.

[Speaker 11]
Sure.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I would like to prepare to do that then. And that's my turn. Oh, my hindrance.

That'll do.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I can... I can do things again.

You will need to stand up.

[Speaker 1]
That takes an action. Standing up is an action.

[Speaker 4]
I guess I would have dropped your weapon in the other room.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, your weapon will be in the other room, unfortunately.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well that's...

[Speaker 1]
You have fists.

[Speaker 3]
That's sad. Yeah. I do.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody has fists.

[Speaker 3]
But these are ghosts, and my weapon did two points of damage to them.

[Speaker 1]
My fists are, like, It appears that they have resistance 5 to physical damage. Yeah. if your fists are 1d4 plus 4 for strength, then anything above a 1 on the dice will deal damage.

[Speaker 8]
Not a lot, but it will.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Friendly AoEs are, like, they target... Like, if I do this, it's gonna hit my friends.

[Speaker 1]
So that's not good. It'll hit me. Yeah.

Also, this one is dead. This one's alive. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I want... I have one hit point, so I want to run away, but I also want to, like, do something to help us get away. But...

Yeah, I think... I'm just gonna... I have one hit point.

What am I gonna do? I'm gonna run... I'm gonna run here and stop so I'm still in line of sight for for that guy.

And I can come back into the fight if I'm healed. But I'm not gonna, like, You could do a recall. Sure.

I guess recall knowledge, religion, I guess. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What do I know about ghosts? So, recall knowledge, you target them. And then you're gonna go to your basic action macro and click on that little thing that says recall knowledge towards the end there.

[Speaker 8]
There it is.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Nothing... Wait, where were we?

Oh, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
So, religion.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what skill it's defaulting to. So, when you do recall knowledge, it shows me a bunch of skills that are applicable. So, basically, it shows me all of them and a bunch of different stuff.

But, yeah. Ghosts. What would you like to know?

[Speaker 1]
Um...

[Speaker 3]
Do they have... Are they... resistant or immune to spirit damage?

I guess? Can I ask that? Yeah, they're neither resistant nor immune.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. Spirit force... I'm sorry, no.

They are resistant to all damage by temper force, ghost touch, or vitality. It's double resistance versus non-magical.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Speaker 3]
So, the only thing I could do is that cone thing. And that's it. The one thing I can do is a cone as the dazzling flash, which blinds them.

Yeah, that's it. Okay. That could be really useful.

Yeah. I just didn't want to... They want to kill me.

No, I don't. I would have had to... The only way I could have done that is if I had gone right here, done it, and done nothing else.

And if it failed, they would just immediately bring me down again.

[Speaker 1]
You also wouldn't have been able to do that anyway because you needed to stand. So it's stand, move, one action left. That's not an action.

Right, yeah. Yeah. I think one action.

[Speaker 2]
This is the first time I've used this. I step.

[Speaker 3]
Holy shit. Right. Not the people actively fighting them, the person running away.

That makes perfect sense.

[Speaker 1]
Well, they're stepping out of reach of the fighter. They have ranged weapons, so...

[Speaker 4]
What do we care about more? Are they ghost?

[Speaker 2]
Are they more spiteful or do they want to lick their wounds more?

[Speaker 3]
And they've literally attacked them. I'm actively running away. Sorry, I don't want to sound too salty.

It's just like...

[Speaker 1]
It's frustrating. No, I get it.

[Speaker 3]
And I'm also just questioning their tactics. I mean, they don't have tactics.

[Speaker 1]
They're like reanimated...

[Speaker 2]
...spirits. And then they go, shoot through walls. No, I don't think... Well, maybe they can, but they can't see you as well.

Right, so they're just kind of blind firing.

[Speaker 1]
If their weapon is incorporeal, then it should be able to pierce walls. But again, they can't see you. Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 2]
It's blind fire. And I think mine, they gotta reload every time.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah. Oh, hold on a second.

[Speaker 2]
Before I step... Fuck you. I just go over here and I reload.

[Speaker 11]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I guess if everyone comes after me, I don't have to move to do my dazzling flash. That's true.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I see you.

[Speaker 3]
So if that works, then I'll probably... Then I'll probably be safe, I guess.

[Speaker 2]
He's healthy. He's a healthy ghost. So I'm gonna risk it.

Do you need me to move him back to here?

[Speaker 7]
Go ahead and target him. Thanks, man.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm guilty of disorder.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, boo. Well, better than nothing.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, three is more than zero.

[Speaker 7]
Exactly. You're so right.

[Speaker 2]
Payin' it. That is a hit.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Knock you down. And I reload.

[Speaker 1]
You're so mean. Yeah, you go to dying three because you only did two.

[Speaker 3]
This is why I house rule that you could... There's... I give people limited actions when they're unconscious because it really sucks just, like, not be able to do literally anything for most of the fight.

[Speaker 1]
No, I've seen that house rule. Yeah. Feel really bad.

Even if it's just being able to, like, crawl around. Yeah, like, being stoned, they're kind of like... Like, oh, yeah, you have one action, you can crawl and make an attack at, like, a heavy penalty, that kind of thing.

Yeah. I like those house rules.

[Speaker 3]
I also house rule if people can, like, make medicine checks at disadvantage to stabilize themselves.

[Speaker 1]
If that makes sense. But, yeah. I wish there were feats like that.

Are there feats like that? No, there's not. There should be.

It would be a very fun... I feel like a game like Pathfinder would have, like, they have feats for everything. That's what house rules are for.

The dying rules are fairly specific. So... It's very rare that stuff like that interests dying other than to decrease the save or increase the dying value to die.

[Speaker 2]
I'll tell you what, though. A fucking living vessel has saved my ass on many occasions. Oh, true.

That thing is good. I like it so. Ayy, he's dead.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, splendid.

[Speaker 2]
Boasting my fucking reload.

[Speaker 7]
That is the end of my turn. Okay. Well, it's good that one is dead.

That is... And thankfully, that is the end of my turn, though.

[Speaker 1]
So... Good luck! Okay.

Well, I'm gonna trust that my team has got this guy. How far can I... So, can I go...

Here.

[Speaker 3]
So, Cher, they are focusing on me and that is letting you guys move pretty freely. So, it's accidental and effective meat dealing.

[Speaker 1]
How do I move here so that I'm not giving a fuck? And then I'm gonna do another Stabilize check. I have Hero Punch.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Stabilize is DC 10, right? I think it's DC 13, but that's... Wait, no.

It's DC of... DC of 10 plus Diamond, I think.

[Speaker 2]
So, it's DC 13 right now.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So...

[Speaker 2]
I definitely knew that. I wasn't...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I... Stabilize is a weird one that barely ever comes up.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like... When I played the... When I played the...

What was it? The beta Dragon Con 2019? I think it was just the...

I think it was just like a flat like DC 13.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's DC 10 plus Dying value if I recall correctly. So, at this... Because they're dying three, it is DC...

It is DC 13. So, that does... Yeah, that is a success.

On the dock, it's just a success. But it is a success. Nobody used Bless you.

Yay. So, you are wounded three, not dying anymore. Nobody get them up because they will just die.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, they don't care if I'm conscious or not. True.

[Speaker 1]
But that is my...

[Speaker 3]
I just want death.

[Speaker 2]
It's your turn already. CC.

[Speaker 4]
I'll target the Lost Ghost with Needle Darts. Two actions.

[Speaker 1]
Do you not have... No, I suppose you do not have any Force damage. Nope.

[Speaker 4]
Holy moly, I hit a spell.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It's a fucking miracle.

[Speaker 4]
Like three damage. Four damage. Holy moly.

You're fucking killing them. We established that this isn't a valid spot, didn't we, this square here?

[Speaker 2]
I think so.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, I think... I found you. No, where was...

[Speaker 2]
When I did it, when I tried to use that spell... CC, watch yourself.

[Speaker 4]
I'm small. Just a little guy.

[Speaker 2]
It's easy to just fight with these guys because they are in a big corporeal. I just have them, you know, in the... I have their ass out one end of the wall and...

[Speaker 4]
I'll try to... Lina can flank from here then.

[Speaker 11]
True. Or Kahali can.

[Speaker 6]
I have lost track of which guys I demoralized already.

[Speaker 1]
It's this one that you demoralized already. This guy... I haven't tried on this guy yet.

You have not tried on that guy yet.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, well... Move up, why not? Change my target to him.

[Speaker 2]
You could be here for flanking.

[Speaker 1]
I would leave that to Nina if I... I think it's better to keep the flighter. Nina goes after the Ancestral Echo does.

You're not gonna kill the Ancestral Echo anymore. Not with that HP. Not without striking runes.

[Speaker 6]
At the very least. I'm not gonna strike it, period. I can't do enough damage.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So, stride there. Hunt Rey. Get this.

Cultism. I don't know if I can add my plus two to that.

[Speaker 1]
You should do it. I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 2]
You get something special if you succeed the opponent, or...

[Speaker 1]
No, it's... Yeah, it's if they crit succeed, they get a bonus to hit.

[Speaker 2]
You get a bonus to hit if you're here.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it stacks. But they're not trying to hit it, they're trying to demoralize it, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, so...

[Speaker 2]
If you're sure that's where you have it, I don't think that's practically...

[Speaker 6]
Well, they can't do enough damage.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not going to strike it, because my attacks don't do enough. You keep saying there's no way that they're going to do it, but here's the thing, that's...

[Speaker 1]
Mathematically, it's highly, highly unlikely. Okay. With the actions that they have remaining.

[Speaker 2]
A lot of highly unlikely things have happened just in this evening, though.

[Speaker 1]
You can't play for highly unlikely, though.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you are trading a mathematical possibility of success for a mathematical certainty of how a team dies. You could do with... I don't know what the...

I'm not familiar with everybody's action rotations and stuff like that. I've still only played an investigator, so...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it wouldn't... It's up to you.

[Speaker 2]
You keep saying it wouldn't, it wouldn't, there's a possibility. I'm looking at the numbers.

[Speaker 3]
Which is why I'm okay with the money cases.

[Speaker 2]
Even in a circumstance where you guys weren't going to know the numbers, necessarily.

[Speaker 3]
At this point, I'm just gonna come in with Valentine and it'll be fine.

[Speaker 1]
They're not... They're unconscious, they can't act.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, I'm gonna rename my... I'm gonna bring in Palatine's twin sister, Valentine, and then...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I see, I see. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And just have the same... Maybe a slightly adjusted build, because I think...

I might want to not do things the way I did. I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Any other... Any other actions?

[Speaker 6]
I'm thinking, hang on. So you're wounded three, but dying zero, is that correct?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but if they get one more dying value, they instantly go to dying four, which just kills them.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, right.

[Speaker 6]
And you just might have a hero point already.

[Speaker 2]
Hero point, you can use to stabilize, but it's the... Once they...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 11]
Once they're dying three.

[Speaker 2]
It goes to dying four, then...

[Speaker 11]
Yeah. I guess.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's a... Okay, so... Depending on what your role was, 21 was a success.

Or, sorry, Occultism was a success, and such.

[Speaker 6]
What is its HP? Eight.

[Speaker 2]
Eight. And AC, 16.

[Speaker 6]
So the only way I can stop this is if I Nat 20 it.

[Speaker 11]
No.

[Speaker 2]
That's for Appfinder 2nd Edition. No, I'm going to speak now. Appfinder 2nd Edition has this lovely little rule where if you get ten above something's target number, it's counted as a critical success.

So, for instance, if you have a flanking bonus, AC becomes 14, and your chance of success...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I know that. I'm bad at math.

[Speaker 2]
...is 16, 17, 18, 19, which one? Again, I don't mind telling you this tutorial dungeon if you want to go back and take... over here and take two attacks.

[Speaker 3]
Totally can. If I have asked to be on the other side of the door because it's a tutorial.

[Speaker 1]
I think we're a bit late for that.

[Speaker 3]
Like, in the moment when it happened, when it was clear that there was enemies there.

[Speaker 4]
James did ask you if you wanted to be on the other side of the door. You wanted to be inside. It was before I knew there was anyone in there.

I didn't know there'd be anyone in there.

[Speaker 2]
And I didn't know there'd be people I can't attack. You still have a second action, then you still have your hero point.

[Speaker 11]
Aye.

[Speaker 6]
I'll hero point for you.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. I have accepted.

[Speaker 6]
There's still the second attack. Because I would not have made this attack without the Recall Knowledge information, though, I am going to pretend I used that action to open Recall Knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
And also Hunt Prey. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't really get what Hunt Prey is there before you have it.

[Speaker 1]
You're Hunter's Edge only. I get to borrow a bunch of skills. That's what I get.

It only works against the Hunter's Edge.

[Speaker 3]
I just now noticed the unturned button. That's much better.

[Speaker 8]
That's good.

[Speaker 2]
First things first. Yes. Okay.

That...

[Speaker 3]
is no damage. If you say so. You have resistances?

No. No.

[Speaker 4]
I don't.

[Speaker 1]
They take no damage because they're at 0 and they can't take hit point damage.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, you'd have to get them with massive damage.

[Speaker 1]
It's a... No, no. It's a replacement effect where instead of taking damage, if they would take damage, instead it's replaced by increasing wounded or dying.

[Speaker 3]
Which is just going to be at 4 now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and then they die.

[Speaker 2]
100% on that?

[Speaker 1]
I get it. I was looking through the stream just to check. I am 100% on that.

Yeah. It's... You can't take damage when at 0.

You replace damage with increasing your dying condition no matter how much damage you take. Oh. Oh, wait.

There's an easy way to...

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Let's add...

[Speaker 1]
No, you're right.

[Speaker 11]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. I'm autistic about this game. I know the rules pretty back to front.

[Speaker 4]
Hell yeah. You're great.

[Speaker 1]
I love having you here. I have some gaps in my knowledge, but most of the time I'm pretty on it.

[Speaker 2]
The only bad one you had today was the Ancestral Echo's health and the chances of killing it.

[Speaker 3]
Which is...

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it didn't have... You're like 9-in-1, so that's totally fine.

[Speaker 3]
I wish I was autistic about this game. I'm just autistic about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. I'll fix it eventually.

Oh. Oh, man.

[Speaker 2]
That's a turn there. Nina. It was mad.

[Speaker 7]
Hello. What's happening?

[Speaker 11]
Is it...

[Speaker 1]
That would kill it, given we know how much health it has. I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah. Victimize.

[Speaker 1]
We're doomed.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, you're staying.

[Speaker 2]
And what level is... I think it's just level 3. I'm gonna give...

Josh a little bit of bonus for successfully briefly persuading them to lay off.

[Speaker 1]
Long enough to get Paladin out of there, even if they eventually die anyway.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, and there is treasure up there, so I'm gonna add that here.

[Speaker 7]
Blended.

[Speaker 3]
And because I died, I, like... I don't get anything, like... You don't, like, get to, like...

make a character with, like... You just start at level 1 with a new character no matter what, right?

[Speaker 2]
Well, level 2.

[Speaker 3]
Level 2.

[Speaker 2]
If you want to swap out your dedication, it would be possible to... Give me just a moment.

[Speaker 3]
To, like, be a ghost or something? You've done it before. Ah, I mean, I didn't wanna, like...

I didn't set out to, like, play a ghost. But I guess...

[Speaker 2]
Play a different character. That's totally fine. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I guess I'll look into it. Was my build bad? Or is it just, like...

[Speaker 1]
No, no. Your build was fine. It's...

purely just circumstance. What level... What level plus were those enemies, James?

Out of curiosity? Uh, the... Plus 1?

The ghosts. And the Argos, actually.

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying to come up with puns involving JFK. JFK's assassination.

[Speaker 1]
Bro.

[Speaker 4]
I'm pretty sure the Echoes are, like, reach a level 1.

[Speaker 11]
Really?

[Speaker 4]
The Echoes, they're level 1, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
They seem different because I rolled... I mean, somebody go back and check. How many...

[Speaker 10]
You rolled, like, a lot of nat 20s.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled a statistically fucked number of nat 20s.

[Speaker 8]
Hey!

[Speaker 2]
I like that question.

[Speaker 10]
Uh, which question, sir?

[Speaker 2]
Somebody... Somebody threw something... I get excited when people ask how many characters they can make.

[Speaker 1]
Hahaha! Oh, I just saw it, yeah. I will say, halfway through a level in one, uh...

in one session isn't too bad. I will have to probably head off pretty soon because it's been four and a half hours now. Yeah.

No worries. No, it's... It's a long...

[Speaker 2]
long session. My brain now is thinking that it's... Where the fuck...

Where's the fucking silver? Please. Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
So, I can either make a new character or change my dedication, which is currently every single thing this character has.

[Speaker 1]
Um, could they... Could they... James, could they potentially change their, uh...

background to, like, Revenant instead of the dedication? I'm not as familiar with, um... Uh, let me get you a screenshot of the Revenant background.

[Speaker 3]
Because currently all my stuff is... I have Vindicator and then I have Domain Initiate twice. And that's...

That's the entire thing. Uh... And I can't get Domain Initiate...

[Speaker 11]
Uh, shit. Let me...

[Speaker 1]
Every single aspect of the path right now. Let me put it in VoiceOverFlow.

[Speaker 11]
Let me...

[Speaker 8]
Uh...

[Speaker 4]
I can look at Ghost and see if it's cool. Description for that background's incredible.

[Speaker 1]
It's... It's pretty good. It's one of my favorites.

I'm gonna be playing somebody with the Saved by Clockwork background soon. And I'm very excited for it. I don't know if you've read that one.

[Speaker 3]
I have not. All right, Ghost and Decation is... is rare.

That's still...

[Speaker 8]
still good.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Let me look at it. Revenant background.

[Speaker 1]
I posted it in the VoiceOverFlow chat. Oh, thank you. There's a second one that could also technically, like, apply, kind of, if you wanted to.

[Speaker 3]
And it's okay to... to take something that's, uh... that's rare.

I'm assuming all those are rare.

[Speaker 1]
I'm... I assume it's just up to James.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna...

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna go after... I'll go over that with you, uh, soon. I just need to take care of this other stuff first.

Now, first things first, there's 48 gold in the treasure. Holy...

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So it's 48 gold and... 70 silver.

So... So each of us gets... 14...

Uh, 13 gold.

[Speaker 10]
And then somebody gets 14. If we split it four ways.

[Speaker 5]
You're right.

[Speaker 1]
So, who wants to get the extra gold?

[Speaker 4]
I don't... I don't need a share of the money.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that's split by three ways. Let me... math again.

If that...

[Speaker 4]
fucks your math, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Divided by three. Uh, that is... That is 18...

That is 18 gold. Uh, and then... somebody gets 19.

If it's divided by three. Uh, you're probably not, uh, counting the 17 silver that we got earlier.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I was not counting the silver.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So that's an extra seven. So it's 55 gold, uh, total.

Um... So that's 18 each, plus one extra.

[Speaker 10]
So...

[Speaker 1]
I guess I'll add 18 to my sheet?

[Speaker 7]
Uh, if you want to take the extra, that is fine.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, if everybody's okay with that.

[Speaker 4]
Please do. You did so much this session. Thank you.

I should be giving you more money, honestly.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, just pay me in real money. Fine.

[Speaker 7]
18. All right. How much gold did you say it was?

18?

[Speaker 1]
18, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Kali, don't forget to take your other pieces of gold. And, uh...

Now we have many guns that we can either use or money.

[Speaker 6]
True. I'm nabbing one of those.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Into the party stash and we can nab them from there.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, fucker! I was standing there.

[Speaker 2]
You're fine.

[Speaker 7]
I am so sorry. I will put them right back.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. It's your... You're fine, you're fine.

Where's the... Where's the... They sell for half gold.

That was the last one that I didn't see.

[Speaker 7]
Which is 14. They should be in the party stash. I can put them back if I...

[Speaker 2]
Hey, there we go. Nobody took the split head bow from, uh...

[Speaker 7]
I didn't get to discuss that with them because they said they left it... You said they left it there to discuss who gets... Who gets it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, you put that into that character's... into your character's inventory from back there.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I'll do that.

[Speaker 2]
The trip-line arrows and stuff like that. Put all that shit in there.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. One second.

[Speaker 2]
All three of them are just low-grade silver. They have a potency rune and...

[Speaker 1]
All right, there we go. They have a potency rune? And...

[Speaker 2]
They have a ghost touch property.

[Speaker 11]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I think they're...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they're also made of cold iron, apparently. They're made of cold iron.

[Speaker 2]
One of them has... Or maybe two of them have cold iron.

[Speaker 1]
I'm looking at mossy hill right now. And that one is...

[Speaker 2]
I think, uh... Grassy knoll has silver.

[Speaker 7]
Well, that's fun.

[Speaker 2]
And jungle mountain also has silver. Does it have... Does it have silver?

Give me one sec. It's so... What they do with the runes in this is so...

It's so fucked. What do you mean? It's very frustrating.

What do you mean by that? They don't have rune in any of the names. So if you want to collect all the runes into something, you have to individually search up every fucking rune.

The name of every fucking rune. Oh, yeah. People on the Foundry Discord are like, no, we're not going down.

[Speaker 1]
It's a lot easier if you just look at the rune on a weapon in Path Builder.

[Speaker 2]
Which is a problem because the VTT is supposed to make the job easier for you. Yes.

[Speaker 10]
It is one of the downsides of Foundry.

[Speaker 2]
They chose not to... And they're like, no, we're not adding the name rune to it so it could be easily searchable. There's only one fucking rune.

[Speaker 1]
You know what they should do? They should add the trait rune to it. They should make a rune trait.

[Speaker 2]
Everyone's going to fuck up how they designed the entire thing because it's built in this very specific fragile fashion.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know anything about Foundry programming. So... I love them otherwise.

Oh, it's a fucking phenomenal VTT. So the weapons are just like fire... That's weird.

[Speaker 2]
That's weird for something that's so...

[Speaker 1]
Whatever.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so there's the gold, there's the items.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we've already distributed the gold. Wanna... not...

put the gold in the stash.

[Speaker 2]
And then on your heart just grab all the iron boots, the red cap, and I think you got the other stuff as well. I don't know how to attach the bayonets to these.

[Speaker 1]
Strictly speaking there's no mechanic to do it. I think you just have them both in your inventory. Now, to do with after this would...

Are these weapons able to have the runes removed from them? In a specific fashion? Okay.

Fair enough.

[Speaker 7]
Just got to find someone who will, you know, able to use them.

[Speaker 1]
Want them. Yeah. Well, I guess since there's four of us and there's only three weapons what do we do?

Rock, paper, scissors, eh?

[Speaker 7]
Well, there are two aquabuses.

[Speaker 1]
We could all... Aqaba? Or something?

I don't know. We could roll a d20 and whoever the lowest doesn't get one of the special ones.

[Speaker 7]
Sure, why not? Gambling. That has always gone well for me.

Let's go. Nina! Nina!

Oh my god! Oh my god! A win!

I still... I haven't recovered from the one time.

[Speaker 4]
No, I don't... I don't need any of this. He's too good.

Oh, well then it doesn't fucking matter because we all get one because if you don't want it then that's free.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just a penguin.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have opposable thumbs.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I guess we'll do it like you get first pick because you don't have a lot of cards.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Makes sense.

[Speaker 7]
By the way, Landy, I still haven't recovered from rolling that two. Sorry, that one. When you rolled a two.

[Speaker 4]
The last time me and Hart rolled for who got a magic item I rolled a three and I was like, oh, you can have it. There's no way you roll lower than that. And then Hart was like, no, and rolled and they rolled a one.

It was fated to give me the magic rock that Cece still has.

[Speaker 2]
Never underestimate our knowledge of other numbers under five.

[Speaker 11]
They do exist.

[Speaker 7]
Mm hmm. I'll take Mossy Hill with the iron. Does silver also hurt ferns?

No. Silver is lackluster.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like passes defenses. Yeah.

[Speaker 11]
Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
I'll take Mossy Hill then and the bayonet attached to it.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 6]
I will take the one out of them.

[Speaker 1]
I guess that leaves grassy knoll for me.

[Speaker 7]
Don't forget to take the bayonet attached to it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
All right. So now we have two arquebuses. I cannot pronounce that.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea. Who wants a gun? Who wants the bird?

I mean, I'll take a second gun. I'm not going to sell it if I take it. I mean, I was going to say I can sell it.

If I sell it, I get enough for a plus one.

[Speaker 7]
You two can take the guns then. You two can take the guns. It's fine.

I'll take the extra halberd. All right.

[Speaker 10]
So... Good job, everyone. James.

[Speaker 1]
Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 1]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what an appropriate gold amount is for that kind of weapon. I know because I marked it as a specific magic item. So it's...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. You're not selling the special one? No, I'm selling the normal one.

Oh. That's my bad. Yeah.

Also, they have the same price as a regular arquebus. So you should probably adjust that.

[Speaker 2]
I just explained that. Like, literally not two seconds ago.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. No, right.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Of course.

[Speaker 11]
Sorry. Sorry.

[Speaker 4]
James, so it's just a pool of water below the window, right?

[Speaker 1]
Look, okay. I have a legitimate excuse.

[Speaker 4]
Go find out. Go, CC, go. No, I said that because I'm stupid and last time we came here it was a puddle.

It was a pool of water down to the next floor. Now it's a... Those fuckers.

James, the time I bring a character that can breathe underwater? Hold on a second. You cock me of swimming, you fucker.

Okay, there we go. So I heard CC, go. And, like, you...

My earbuds fucked up. I said the time I bring a character that can breathe underwater and swim? You cock me of my swimming, you motherfucker.

[Speaker 2]
If you go down that hole you can... And Heart knows what's down that hole.

[Speaker 10]
What's the max level of item buying?

[Speaker 1]
For the city?

[Speaker 2]
Level of the city is 7 so that's what we've capped it at right now.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So I can, in fact, spend 35 gold on a plus 1 potency.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, no, I can't buy potency. I'm not using potency.

[Speaker 1]
Nevermind, ignore me. I forgot how fucking kineticists work. Don't worry about me.

I'll type in the chat later for you to standardize it. I, in fact, need a 30... 60 gold item.

Oops. Because that's how kineticists work. Because you need to buy a gate attenuator that increases your saves as well as your attack rolls.

I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 4]
How much money do you need?

[Speaker 1]
It's 60 gold. I've got 38 and a heart.

[Speaker 4]
I'll give you 30.

[Speaker 1]
Don't have to.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well. CC's gonna flex and fly all of us home into his Firefly.

[Speaker 11]
We're not even catching the boat back.

[Speaker 4]
I have a car. Well, not a car.

[Speaker 1]
This for the record... Hang on, let me put it in my inventory. This for the record is what I'm buying.

It is not a rare item. It's a potency rune for a except only for my class.

[Speaker 2]
What we do for the magic items is if you check for something that's in that's magical rare or uncommon if it's uncommon roll a d6 roll 4 through 6 it's in there for rare and for rare magic items it's double check I believe it's if you roll a 6 if you roll a 5 then it's roll 4 or 5? It's something that you can order it's just not available right away. Ah.

That's fine. I like that. It's hard to like decide on stuff like inventory and stuff like that.

It is magical though, right? It's magical, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
It's not uncommon though.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah, it's not uncommon.

[Speaker 4]
It's magical. Yeah, but most cities in what we've been doing I believe I thought I thought Grunloch just had level 7 like all common items. That is what I have been running.

[Speaker 1]
Normally what happens is that most common magical items are just available in specialist shops. Like you most big cities will have those specialist shops that sell those items. It's the uncommon and the rare that would you would have yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, in that case skip with that if that's by the book then that's how we'll play it.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
We'll use the uncommon and rare thing for uncommon and rare items but you know.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I yeah, I'm uncommon and rare makes sense because they're generally stronger harder to find or you know, that's why it's better in general like the frog spell. Like fucking 100 toads truly the best spell.

[Speaker 7]
500 toads?

[Speaker 1]
Oh right, yes it's 500. 500 cigarette.

[Speaker 4]
500 cigarettes.

[Speaker 1]
So you were giving me 30 gold.

[Speaker 4]
I'll give you 30 gold enough to pay for your lodgings and stuff until you play next as well if you choose to play again.

[Speaker 10]
I probably will.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah having you is great. I can turn off my brain now because someone knows more about the game than me so No, I really didn't know about the reach thing where diagonals don't count for 10 foot reach. I'd never read that before.

[Speaker 1]
It's just if you're measuring it from a if you're measuring it on the VTT then it appears as 15 rather than Mathematically it appears as 15 feet on the VTT but you can reach that with a reach weapon.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I I read that and I was like what? I've been running this song for like 3 years now.

[Speaker 1]
I need to apologise for my It's purely It's purely a limitation of the VTT.

[Speaker 4]
I find I had a Don Derga so the amount of reach of 15 maybe I don't have to apologise to Caleb he can eat shit.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, I missed what happened.

[Speaker 4]
What? I need to figure out how to give him a bear weapon. Oh, there's the Ursine Avenger archetype archetype Wait, what archetype?

The bear Ursine Avenger hood I think The bear hood You become a bear man.

[Speaker 1]
Is that not just Is that not just werecreature dedication?

[Speaker 4]
No, the The Ursine Avenger hood is you wear a bear skin and you get bear powers.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not seeing it in Pathbuilder.

[Speaker 4]
It's from Treasure Vault.

[Speaker 1]
Let me go on archives.

[Speaker 4]
I love archives I've just posted the link.

[Speaker 1]
It's so good. Oh, yeah, there it is. Huh.

[Speaker 4]
Because in 5e he was a a druid barbarian who would just turn into a bear and fuck shit up. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's a fun build. Love that. I mean, you can kind of do that untamed druid Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine. Two people submitted their tickets. We're going to add their foundry stuff.

[Speaker 10]
I am going to head off. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 11]
Thank you for playing. It was a pleasure.

[Speaker 10]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Have a good evening, guys. I don't know what time it is.

I'm going to go to bed.

[Speaker 10]
Evening.

[Speaker 1]
Morning.

[Speaker 10]
Daytime. Something. Have a good one.

See ya. Thank you. See you.

[Speaker 7]
I'll probably also have to go to sleep soon because it's almost midnight. And, Landy, it's probably later for you.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's nearly 2am. I need to get up at like like 6 hours to drive. My fiancée's dogged the vet for a check-up, so that's fun.

Yeah, I'll do that. Thank you for running. That was a lot of fun.

Rep people that got stuck in the ghost room. Hmm. Locking door straps.

So funny. I love the locking door straps. It's so fucked up.

Yeah, I'll catch y'all later. Peace. See you later, buddy.

[Speaker 10]
Goodnight.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you for running, James. Sorry for completely forgetting it was today and not tomorrow. But thanks for being at a very good time.

[Speaker 3]
And you saved the party. Yay.

[Speaker 8]
You said I think you said you wanted to talk to me about Bye-bye. See you. I don't think it's like private.

No, no, it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
It's the what did you you were asking about some possible alternative?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know. I just kind of totally unexpected.

[Speaker 5]
And you know, like, I get that everybody's different. But like this is the third time playing Pathfinder.

[Speaker 2]
Are you mentioning something else or what are you talking about?

[Speaker 8]
Oh no, you killed me in my like third game of Pathfinder. Kind of fucking I'm a little upset.

[Speaker 5]
Obviously. But I'm I feel like there were a few ways to avoid that. I don't know how to play this game.

[Speaker 8]
I don't I'm not like you I went unconscious and you kept fucking just killing me. Like at that point, what was I supposed to do? It was the things beforehand I was telling you about.

[Speaker 2]
Like, hey, if you go into this room, this is where the drawers are. There's a trap and treasure inside. Hey, by the way, if you can, it's going to lock so you can but you succeeded so you could be on the outside of the room.

You didn't say it's going to lock. I posted it in the chat or something like that. I don't really mind you leaving because you didn't tell me what to do.

people and I had to server mute you like eight times because you would not stop fucking talking over people. It was insane to me because I told you several times stop talking over people, don't narrate this, hey, we're trying to get this stuff done, please. You're asking me about a rules interaction, you're refusing to post it in chat or even name it or whatever, which is totally fucking insane.

I'm trying to tell you how to do stuff and just keep doing it. I say, hey, stop narrating all your stuff like you're narrating like your tech problems while you're at the computer and there's people taking their turns. It's like they can't hear each other when you're doing that.

[Speaker 5]
You only hear you and you think it's fine. But there's other people in the game. I got a tag here.

Oh, Applethorn.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they left, they left the chat. So no, I banned them. So earlier I was talking to you about, hey, the I don't know what you're unclear about this, let me go back to the chat.

So the reason we both linked that thing that said character creation and campaign whatever is because if you create a thread inside that forum, they give us a really nice spot to handle individual questions and whatnot. Also explains certain things. If you go into the forum at large, you can see a bunch of people have posted their path builder whatever's.

[Speaker 5]
But I just wanted to, didn't want to continue going back and forth and back and forth inside that, that session times thing. The instructions that were posted, they weren't exactly entirely clear.

[Speaker 12]
They maybe could use a little bit of, you know, a little bit of. Okay. So what do you have for me there?

Well, I was just asked, well, it got answered by the other person, Landy, but there was just no mention of if path builder was a viable option in the original instructions. And I was like, oh, okay. Right.

[Speaker 2]
That's not really an instruction, though, because you're going to be making your character on foundry anyways.

[Speaker 10]
Well, the thing that, let me, session times, let's see.

[Speaker 12]
Oh, it says make, all you said was make a character thread please as directed. And it was like, well, it wasn't either directed either way. So I was like, the question was still there.

That's why I was like, ah. So, but then.

[Speaker 2]
Right. So what Landy said was original character creation, roll stuff is here, you will need to make a post showing your character concept. And as for foundry access from James.

[Speaker 12]
Now that not related to that part, just the other.

[Speaker 2]
That's the instruction, because you need to make a post showing your character concept.

[Speaker 12]
Let me reframe the question, and then maybe it'll be a little bit more clear. The question was, if I was allowed to build a character in path builder. That was the question.

[Speaker 2]
We're not under any kind of question as to what your question originally was. It was just, hey, we asked you, can you make a thing here? Check here.

Right.

[Speaker 5]
Because that's where we handle those kinds of character questions.

[Speaker 2]
And maybe that would be the more appropriate thing to put the, maybe we could say, hey, ask for character things in this. Though I don't really want to keep people from asking character questions anywhere. I just want to keep that session times channel clear because we need it.

[Speaker 12]
No, I get that. I just didn't know the lay of the land for this. And so the, what do you call it?

Wasn't, I don't know. It just didn't seem like it was clear enough.

[Speaker 5]
That's all. Where's the landing page that I was looking at? It's not landing pages.

I mean, to my point, you still haven't made one. No, because I'm working on it right now. I'm working on building it.

[Speaker 2]
Create the thread. That's usually where you showcase the character concept.

[Speaker 11]
Like here's what I'm planning on making.

[Speaker 5]
Correct. I am still building the character in Path Builder. That's all.

Okay. I think our communication styles are a little mismatched. I'm going to agree.

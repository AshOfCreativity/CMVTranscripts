[Mimosa (Nessie)]
My youngest did that to me a week or two ago.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
She came up and like patted my back and everybody else was sleeping. I was the only one up and she touched me and I screamed and then she started crying because I scared her so bad.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, you scared her.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's so good.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You can hear her come in. You can see her come in.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
If you look behind him right before she makes a noise, you can see her little shadow. Yeah.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Which is the funniest thing in the world to me. He doesn't hear it. That's so great.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
His scream is so... it's so visceral.

[Referee (Landie)]
Makes me really appreciate streaming. Reminds me of a scream I heard. It was a dude, he was like trapped in his car because of a flood or a storm or something.

And lightning starts striking and he screams exactly like Homer Simpson. Like, ah, ah, ah! Sort of like, I wish I could do it just like...

I would have to, like, wake up my neighbor though if I don't want to do that for a scream.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I love that it's the same one consecutively every single time. Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
What are you up to in the manuscript? McCannon getting into the pool was page 31. You have page 39, I think is the furthest in.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I rolled the... oh, sorry.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll get to your downtime in a moment, if you're coming.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No problem.

[Referee (Landie)]
And that just takes a day, so you can do whatever you want for the rest of your stuff. When you leave the darkness, the words of power stop working. So the darkvision ends, but when you come back, it works again.

So I need to get the spell effect and drag it on again. Who needs darkvision? I think it was the fur and McCannon.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I thought it was literally Cammon.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Easy. Might just be fur, yeah. Oh.

Our kitsune didn't have darkvision. Fur and Cammon have their darkvision back the next 24 hours in the darkness.

[Referee (Landie)]
Front door, there is a manuscript page, I am just making that now. But Cammon, for your downtime, you spend a day talking to the publisher, and going through their records of things, and you find a really interesting set of manuscripts. One of them is titled Skeleton Cave, and the other is titled Zombie Cave.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No.

[Referee (Landie)]
And they were written a couple months ago. And it is awfully specific to what happened in the caves when you read through them. But those manuscripts, they're not edgy and reference darkness as much as this one does.

What else? She has been in the valley a while. She's had to move about as people would find her house and harass her for autographs and things.

She has written many mystery books. Is the printing press a thing in Chillmist Valley? It is a thing in Pathfinder, I think it's a level 9 item.

[Kamon (Heart)]
The press?

[Referee (Landie)]
I see. It's more likely than her books are getting reproduced by either scribes or some kind of magical servant scribing many copies of the book.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Why is it a level 9 item? Not just anyone can make propaganda.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, so mystery author moves around because...

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah yeah, rabid fans mostly. Rabid fans mostly causing her to move about.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, so... And owns a printing press, cool.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, no. That's other means of getting... The publisher has friends that magically print books.

They pay people to scribe it, or they have paid scribes, or they have unseen servants scribing the books to make several copies of them.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
You find in one of the mystery books as well, the main character as a child was gifted a set of stones from their mother, called the Everafter Stones. They would use the stones to protect themselves from darkness. It's the only other thing you find.

They were a set of stones that go together.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh! Like the stone that presumably got taken away. Alright, that's cool.

[Referee (Landie)]
The one that McKanan has.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Any attempts to identify the stone come back with nothing. It is just a stone. Alright, you get page 33.

[Referee (Landie)]
The text is added in, spacing's weird. Spacing's fixed. Spacing's still weird.

Now, just out of character, the manuscript is grammatically, and it's perfect in that sense. If there is a mistake in the manuscript, that's like me being stupid and not understanding the one million constraints of how to use a comma in the English language. Just ignore that, because I am not a writer, and I know like half of you are writers, so do not judge me too harshly.

I like games.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, alright, I'll put away my red pen.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
This is page 33?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, who would like to have the page? I'll drop it into whoever's inventory. Whoever shouts me first the loudest gets it.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Me first.

[Referee (Landie)]
And that was 33. No unintentional spoilers. Ah, but yeah, you can't use the words of power outside of this dungeon.

They don't even try. If you rock up to James' dungeon and like, oh, I got this word of power that instantly wins a fight, James is gonna kill you instantly. That's what they do outside of the dungeon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Fascinating. Alright, so, reading it out loud. Also, it doesn't seem to have that many grammatical mistakes.

All is well. After resting, the heroes returned ready to face the darkness once more. On first inspection, the house remained as they left it, but the darkness felt more sinister.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Well, that doesn't bode well, does it?

[Kamon (Heart)]
It doesn't. There's nothing to it but to go inside. We just have to remember the electricity is still out, so...

Well, let's try the other side.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
He was hiding in his... Maelstrom.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Cat gone. Put the traps.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, roll me a secret perception, please. Who are we missing in the party? Voltage's cannon?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh wait, we should all put ourselves in the party.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, Pyro's missing as well. Fuck, Pyro's level 6, my balancing never happened, it's out the window.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I leveled up last time.

[Referee (Landie)]
Wait, is this continuing on? We have added my cannon. Is this continuing on the last one, or have we had a rest?

It's been a week. You left the darkness and rested. Oh, okay.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Ooh, James has so many fans. You have your fans.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, perception check. Uh, this door is as non-trapped as the rest of the doors you've encountered. I think you've encountered a trapped door.

Inside this room is a dining area. There are lots of shiny pieces of cutlery and plates. And there is a word of power on the table as well.

It's the word nourishment.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'll give it to Kaer Morhen.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, when you hold the word you get the idea of what it does. Uh, nourishment will heal whoever has it to full health. As it heals you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
A frontliner probably would do better at that than I.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Which makes sense.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll add it to Mimosa's sheet in just a second. Great. That is in Mimosa's sheet now.

[Machannan (James)]
Hello!

[Referee (Landie)]
What a blind GM roll it is. Very good. Uh, and the door ahead of you to the north is the same.

It is also not trapped. Also you can tell. Mimosa, you notice a tripwire just to the left in the hallway beyond here though.

Uh, I believe that's a thievery check. I can ping that to chat. Very good.

You take it apart. And on closer inspection you can see that the wire looks meaner now. You'd think it would actually cause damage if you walked into it.

Which is different to before. They were just making people clumsy.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
We need to be a little bit more careful. The tripwires are... I thought it was a little bit more deadly.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Uh...

[Referee (Landie)]
You hear a piano playing from beyond the door above you, Mimosa. You have a little peek through the door, and there is a spirit at the piano. And as you...

Ah, it's playing the piano. And as you open the door fully, the spirit disappears. The song felt familiar to you, Mimosa.

You aren't sure why you've heard it before.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I've heard it before. She'll say that a little bit loudly so that whatever spirit is still there can hear it. I'd love to hear it again.

Can you find anything in this room besides...

[Referee (Landie)]
Can you just read what I've sent to you in chat?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, sorry!

[Referee (Landie)]
It's all good. The chest is locked next to you, and there is a locked door to the west of the room. I'm gonna skull-drag my cannon through like three different walls, catching him up to the...

[Machannan (James)]
Thank you, I've been editing my compressor.

[Referee (Landie)]
All good?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
As she's looking throughout the room, she can't get the song out of her head, so she's gonna go over... And just kind of start plucking the keys.

[Referee (Landie)]
Give me a performance check.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Best of luck. Please. I don't know...

Oh, her... Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
That's pretty good.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah! She'll start plucking, and then she gets into it, and she's like, Huh, I do remember this.

[Machannan (James)]
The cannon would like to investigate to see if there's any kind of ghostly fetters. Anything that's attached to spirits keeping them here in the afterlife? Or from the afterlife?

[Referee (Landie)]
Sure. Um... I think that's just to recall knowledge, but obviously it focuses on cultism.

[Machannan (James)]
Pretty good.

[Referee (Landie)]
Sorry, the sheet music for it was sitting on the piano, and you do recognize the song. As you play the tune on the piano, both the chest and the door unlock. McCannon, you assume that the spirit here was some kind of entertainer that worked in the manor.

It appears that playing the song has let them pass on.

[Machannan (James)]
Interesting.

[Referee (Landie)]
Inside the chest is a bunch of money and a manuscript page. I'm gonna give that to Mimosa. You get a...

I kinda lowballed you on gold last time. There's like 300 gold in here. Uh...

I don't have a loot container, so that's gone. Yeah, all gold to the party stash. I'm lazy.

Yep, I'm just adding it to Mimosa's sheet now. 36.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
The piano called out to the hallway beyond. A sad melody filled the air. Mimosa slightly opened the door.

The song was calling her. She'd heard it before, but she wasn't sure. It reminded her of a peaceful time.

As she peered through, she saw a ghost at the piano, and the spirit warned of her presence at lunch. Mimosa inspected further. The room seemed clear, so she entered the piano.

The sheet music for the melody sat in the rack, but Mimosa did not need it. Ha! I do remember this, she boasts, as she sat in front of the piano.

But she'd come an effortless way from her hands, because of course she did. The locked door and chest opened, waiting behind the door. It was a hatch that led deeper into darkness.

[Referee (Landie)]
I didn't have a hero point. Oh! Sorry, hang on.

Before, we need to go over how many hero points everyone has. So... um...

Mimosa now has three. Parah should have two. Kamon was maxed out at three.

Meek now has three. Furr has two, and McCannon has two. Continuing on from where you were up to last session.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Can't be.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ugh, I said heroic.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright, we may go through the door now.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, yeah, stepping into that room there is a hatch that leads downstairs.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright, this goes downstairs. Do we want to do that first, or look at all the other rooms in this level?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We don't have many left, I don't think.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
There was like a door... there's a room over here, and a hallway down here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And an elevator. The elevator doesn't work. Ah, electricity's out.

And that probably goes where the elevator goes.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Or where the... you can start up the generator.

[Referee (Landie)]
The elevator inside should go up or down. The elevator outside could only go down.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, we might as well mark off this floor and then go down.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, there's a hallway.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Should be careful of trips.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah, she is keeping an eye on me.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yep.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright.

[Referee (Landie)]
And that room... is nothing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, Carmen, you notice a tripwire just up near where the moose always stepped.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh my god. I'll call out a warning, but she went the other way, so it's just like, ah, no. Oh, good to know.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
If you want to try to undo it, you can.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is it possible to just step over it without...

[Referee (Landie)]
I suppose so.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I don't like the sound of that. To be frank, my disabling traps isn't the best, but I can always try.

[Referee (Landie)]
I need a trained thievery check.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I have a plus 11 in thievery, so if you would like me to do it, I can. Please. Please.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I have a girl with my fingers, I can try. Oh, I also have a plus 11 in thievery, so it's acting.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Hang on. Hang on. There we go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Let's add a lot of twang. There is a locked closet in front of you there, Mimosa.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Can I pick it?

[Referee (Landie)]
I need to look at the rules for locks.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's like three rules or something.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
For complex locks, I guess simple ones can be one, but...

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Nah, I think they're all two. At least two.

[Referee (Landie)]
And then you have, like, threes. A simple lock requires three successful DC20 thievery checks. I think it's simple.

I think the nicer rooms would have average locks. As you did just find 300 gold sitting in a room. So yes, I need three thievery checks.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh my gosh.

[Referee (Landie)]
I believe that makes it harder.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You're doing alright.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I need to roll one more.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think that one breaks it.

[Referee (Landie)]
I need to see...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
If it breaks it, then I will re-roll it.

[Referee (Landie)]
Pick a lock. It is not secret, which is good. On a crit failure, you break your toolkit and leave behind obvious damage.

Would you like to use a hero point?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Two successes. You're good.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Inside is...

[Referee (Landie)]
There is a word of power. And there is 50 gold worth of jewelry. The word of power is light.

It will end in an encounter with anything in this dungeon when used.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
How much gold? 50 or 30? Which one was it?

[Referee (Landie)]
50 gold worth of jewelry.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, okay. This lady, this author, is quite loaded. She has so much jewelry just laying around.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I do suppose if you're so well-renowned you have to make a run for it every so often. You'd collect enough jewelry for decades.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Are we becoming cat burglars?

[Kamon (Heart)]
You can see it as a payment for our services.

[Referee (Landie)]
Carmen, you spot another tripwire down the end of the hallway to the right?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright. I'll warn people about the tripwire to the right. Oh dear.

Three cubes for passive perception, everyone.

[Referee (Landie)]
Failed it on the map. The hallway down to the left is clear, though.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright. I'm just going to undo it now.

[Referee (Landie)]
Check.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You know what? I'm not using my last hero point.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, you need to make a dex save then as you trigger it. I'll clean that for you. I didn't target you with that, sorry.

In a success you take half damage, so you take half of this 2d6. I made that invisible, sorry. You take 5 damage.

Sorry, 2 and a half. 2. Rounded down.

Very good. It just cuts your hand a little bit.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, well. Alright, well, at least it's disabled. After you.

[Referee (Landie)]
As you open that door, shadows come and attack you. We're going to have initiative.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh dear.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Of course I waste my crit on initiative.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I have a feeling this one might suck, since I'm right in the doorway.

[Referee (Landie)]
Make sure your tokens are where they would have been, and your weapons are all equipped and that sort of thing. I doubt you'd be walking around here without them out at this point. I need to look in Landy's big folder of monsters.

Now there's one at the end of the hallway. There's one. There's one.

We just need Mechanon's initiative. Oh, I'm sorry. James, you missed out on me doing my impression of Mechanon while you got into the pool.

What was that? Alright, let's begin. You notice a shadow I redacted come into existence in front of you down the hallway.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I do not like that at all. Give me... Alright, give me one second.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's all good?

[Kamon (Heart)]
You know what, let's start with the classics as we just...

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, sweet beats. The door wasn't trapped, by the way. It's just the more stuff you do in the mansion, the more likely something's going to attack you.

I love flat checks. Welcome back, encounter rolls from AD&D!

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
What time of day would it be?

[Referee (Landie)]
It would be mid-morning, but it's nighttime looking here at the mansion.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, awesome. Wait, let's try this. Please do what we'll say.

[Referee (Landie)]
They are not immune to this.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh joy. Well, I can't see everyone who's on the counter. So, pick a guy.

[Referee (Landie)]
You want me to pick a guy? Sorry, why am I picking a guy? I'm reading this and it's all going over my head.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ah, because... Even though it's the range, because they're not on the encounter tracker, I can't ping them. So...

It says within 30 feet of the target. I don't think I have to see them, but I can't target them if I cannot see them.

[Referee (Landie)]
And what do I apply to him, friend1?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, make them do the save. The second guy to do the save.

[Referee (Landie)]
You get a crit success.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ah, well then nothing happens to them. Oh, the first guy who failed gets Frightened1 and Slowed1.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It only targets one creature, though, doesn't it?

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's infectious. When they fail, I can spread it to another person.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, it's at the start of his turn, though, I think. But now we've already done that, so we don't need to worry about doing it later.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No, no, no, it's... Oh, you're right, you're right, it's fine. End of turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, they have... Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I see a sliver of a guy over here. And we will Needle Darts.

[Referee (Landie)]
Cooked him. Jesus Christ. Ah, that gets doubled.

Very good. Again, just reminding you, if they're not in the magical light, their shadows will give them resistance to a lot of types of damage.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And that is my turn for now. Oh, wait, I just ended it.

[Referee (Landie)]
You're good? I'm gonna let you end your own turns. If it gets to a point where I think it should have been ended, then I will end it.

So it is the guy who has slowed. His friend does the save, and it's fine. And he is going to come at the Mercer and attack with his last action.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No way.

[Referee (Landie)]
How long has he slowed for?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Let me check.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, as long as you sustain the spell? That's nasty.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh yeah, remain slow and can't reduce the fight in condition as long as it's sustained. Sweet!

[Referee (Landie)]
Very nasty.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
So he has one action left. He uses it to swipe at the Mercer. He misses.

Am I rolling these publicly? I am.

[Machannan (James)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Cannon.

[Machannan (James)]
Beautiful. Are any of these guys in the magical light?

[Referee (Landie)]
There is no magical light, I believe.

[Machannan (James)]
Oh, I thought the pair is halo.

[Referee (Landie)]
It is not on. Currently there is torchlight, which does not give the benefits of magical light to attacking the redacted.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Machannan (James)]
That's okay. We're going to try something else then. No, I can't coerce during combat, so that's okay.

So I'm going to do... I always get confused about the order of these, but I'm going to try to demoralize them first.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. Hold up. He does speak your language, so that doesn't fail.

So I need to change that. On a value that I believe it's still just frightened 1.

[Machannan (James)]
It should be a plus 11 for demoralize. I don't know why it's plus... I don't want to say it's plus 7.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's because it believes it's unintelligible. That's my fault with not giving them common as a language.

[Machannan (James)]
Oh, no worries. Alright, so that'd be frightened 1.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, it already was frightened 1, though. Would you rather target a different one?

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, I'll target a different one for that. That's totally fine.

[Referee (Landie)]
You would get frightened 1 on the one behind you.

[Machannan (James)]
I think I'm going to try Bon Marte on that one. Just... infinite diplomacy.

Ah! Okay, that's fine. That one is not debuffed.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. It is the... The Hurt Shadow's turn.

It has a 30ft flyspeed. It was going for para, then it sees a goblin that it doesn't have to move as far for, and it stops going to attack. It has two actions still.

It is frightened 1. Misses on the first. Misses on the second.

Why are you attacking me?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I'm innocent and pure.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Oh, no. Yeah. I'm going to eliminate the world and take the doomed condition.

[Referee (Landie)]
Very good. Are you putting it on Jacob? Yep.

Very good.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Jacob is going to open up here.

[Referee (Landie)]
That guy is also in it. Okay, I just need them to do spell saves. Your DC is 21.

Whoops, I moved him through the wall. That's his. He fails.

This guy is fine. Okay, so he is stunned 2. And then you attack him and miss.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Yep, and that's my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Me.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I call forth my protector! And he'll... Tree will pop up to his right in that square, maybe square next to him.

One action left. Hit him with a blast of... Vitality energy, see if it does anything.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Nope.

[Referee (Landie)]
Nope. He done. What does the tree do?

Does it... It's like a shield, sort of?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Yeah, it sits there and any adjacent creature next to it, it can interpose and take the hit. I see.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, Mimosa.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
The shadow in front of you is not resisting damage currently.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oy yi yi.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, it's the last shadow's turn that is resisting damage. He moves up to you, Mimosa, and is going to take a swing at you. That one hits.

Would you like me to apply your damage? No, you've got it. Great.

Second one misses. We move back to Kamon for round 2. I just love seeing the plus minus courageous anthem.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So, one action to sustain the infectious aneurysm, and then...

[Referee (Landie)]
Does anything else happen when you sustain it, or does it just keep going?

[Kamon (Heart)]
It just keeps going. Not much. They just get plagued with it for a little longer.

And then I'll give... I'll give Forbidden Ward against... So this guy will be forbidden against hurting her for now.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. I think I drag it onto the... Did you drag that onto them?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I will try. Nope, I lack permission.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. No, I fucked that up, I think. It doesn't matter, we'll remember that.

Saddest things on both of them.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, that ends my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. Ah, fuck, I did it. My bad.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'll remember just to let you do it.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, no, no, you do it, you do it.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm cross-firing on what we each do and what we don't do.

[Referee (Landie)]
I need to be punished. Hera, what would you like to do?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I am going to... How do I have anything other than... Needle darts!

[Referee (Landie)]
Classic. Classic.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I'm gonna miss. I don't care, I'll point that, why not?

[Referee (Landie)]
Goddamn. He takes double that, he has no resistance, he's dead. Cooked him.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Huzzah. And then... I don't think I have another target, and I can't really move?

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, you can target Mechanon or Meek or Kamon.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's true.

[Referee (Landie)]
Kill them.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We can just Moonlight Ray Meek right now and end it all. Yeah, I don't think I have anything else I can do. Oh, I can shield myself, I'll shield myself, why not?

Oh, it automatically went on. Neat.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll let you end your turn like a good DM. The guy next to Mimosa's turn, he did not get stunned, he is slowed though. He is going to attack Mimosa once, then stride.

Does Mimosa have reactive strike or anything to smack him?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Um, I don't think so. Nope.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, he moves out of the light, so he's no longer afflicted by that. No, he should have done a save at the start of his... No, at the end of his turn, the end of the turn.

He doesn't get to lose his slowed or his frightened because Kamon is sustaining the spell. We move to Mechanon.

[Machannan (James)]
I'm really tempted to just, like, try to get it. There can't be anything wrong with just trying to get it.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's set every melee.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm thinking.

Thank you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, we had an investigator in one of our games, and he used to do really good. Right? Why is it always the same?

[Machannan (James)]
That's totally fine. I'm going to use skill stuff instead. Is this guy still demoralized?

[Referee (Landie)]
He's dead. He's cooked. So there's one in the doorway up here that you get a slight glance of, and there's one down the end of the hallway that only has cover from Mimosa and Kamon being in front of you.

[Machannan (James)]
All you use to demoralize... That other one doesn't have frightened, it seems.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yep, no, you can scare him. So ignore the minus four for unintelligible. I still haven't fixed that.

I'll do the original shadow when I get a chance. It is a success. Yes, it doesn't become a crit.

Sad.

[Machannan (James)]
So close. Against him, I shall use bombardment. I'm going to reroll that with a hero point.

And I can't roll it.

[Referee (Landie)]
No. James, why do you roll so badly?

[Machannan (James)]
I don't know, man. Something's going on here.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Landy in the background giving us all minus four numbers.

[Machannan (James)]
I'm going to move through you guys so I can be positioned to take them. Excuse me, excuse me.

[Referee (Landie)]
Adding some words of power to give Mikanin bonuses to devise a stratagem role in this dungeon, because it's fucking hurting me watching this.

[Machannan (James)]
This is my job to adapt, you know?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
So pathetic you got pity points.

[Referee (Landie)]
Not yet. Do you wish to continue your light spell?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
You go to doomed two. Yep.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
How far can you take doom before you just die?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Uh, three or four? You die specifically from doom, unless you get knocked out and then you die instantly.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, if you're dying value when you die, you're no longer doomed.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I mean, that's on the plus side.

[Referee (Landie)]
Maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doom value.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So what if you get to a negative dying value?

[Referee (Landie)]
I assume you instantly die if you go down.

[Machannan (James)]
GM, technically the boss says that when I die, or that the doom disappears when I die, and so that means that I wouldn't die, because technically the dying can be the answer.

[Referee (Landie)]
So the cannon tests this out for you and dies. It does work as he theorized, he is dead.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, it does say if your maximum dying value is reduced to zero, you instantly die.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah. Cool. You can die from being doomed then, I like that.

Uh, he needed to make a save as you moved up to him. He has no resistance to that because of the light.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So for most people it's four.

[Referee (Landie)]
He makes the save, he is stunned one. He takes the full damage, leaving him with not much health. Uh, N'vo has two actions left, I believe.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I moved up one and I gave him three.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, very good. Did you attack twice?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Uh, he needed to move twice.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, okay, very good.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Meek. Sorry, I'm eating chips and I didn't want to be too loud, so I'm like muting between mute and unmute.

[Machannan (James)]
I appreciate that, that's a good thing.

[Referee (Landie)]
Just wanted to make sure you stole a few actions, but you're all good. Meek, what you got for us?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Yeah, only sees one thing left. Really can't see the other one that thinks it's there.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, I don't think you can. Oh, you might. You can just, he has a lot of cover for me though.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I'll take care of this one. We'll grab the one in front of Jacob.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Good god.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
He's dead. Did I, did I get it? If he launches, it looks like a fireball between everybody's legs because they're really small.

[Referee (Landie)]
Very good.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You got this, good job, darling.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
He'll try to move up and see if there's another one. I hear another one.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think you can see him, you should be able to see his token fully, right? Ah, there he is. I think he has standard cover.

You done?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Oh, that was a two-action blast and a one-action...

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, it was two-action blast, gotcha, gotcha. Mimosa. Um, I think he is in the light now.

Yes, he is. He should have made a save before.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That guy?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, that guy. He is stunned too. What would you like to do?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
What, we fry one, then freeze one?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Wow, 10 feet is a lot. Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
You do it against the wall, behind it. 10 foot burst, yeah, you put it in the room. You can contain it to the room, I think.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay. I'll just pretend it's in the room, I put it on him. Yep.

[Referee (Landie)]
If you... How does that work, do you roll the damage and it'll be, it'll give me a save?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
So, yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
It didn't, but we can adapt.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's a, yeah, there's a save in the thing.

[Referee (Landie)]
He takes half of that. Alright. Uh, that's wrong.

He should have taken four.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That is half.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, it... He took no damage because his resistance is still active on his sheet. But, uh, no, he did take the four damage.

I didn't make a macro for it to negate his resistance, because I'm lazy. Uh, and this'll be the same, I'm just gonna add it to his sheet rather than clicking the damage. Very good.

All done. Done. His turn.

He loses two actions for stunned. He is demoralized. He will...

I think he's gonna keep going for Mimosa. Ugh, he nearly crit you. Ah, but that's his turn.

Come on. There is one, uh, redacted left. Uh, you are muted.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I am so sorry, make it through and we'll see.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yep, I got the gist. We're good. Uh, success.

On his success, he takes the full initial damage, but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ah, he lives another day. All right. Um, I guess with my bonus action, we're just going to shoot the guy, as one does.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ha, very long.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I miss! We will, he, you know what, let me reroll it. I have...

I have full. We will use a hero point. Huzzah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Look at that, a hero point paid off for your heart. That never happens.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, well, there's the damage.

[Referee (Landie)]
He's really hurt from that. He's pretty close to dead. In fact, I am.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okey dokey, is there room for me to sneak around? No, not at all.

[Referee (Landie)]
But I think you can see him in the square, barely. You'll have...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No.

[Referee (Landie)]
You can't see the token at all?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, I can see the shadow of the token. Like, if I can see the token, it's just like, the... No, it's not even the very edge.

I just see the shadowy outline in Mimosa's thing. Alas. Oh, Mimosa's injured.

I can heal you. I will cast a two-action heal.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I've been soaking up a lot of the damage, thank you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You are not undead, so...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm not.

[Referee (Landie)]
Pyra takes a break from flinging metal at shadowers to remember that she can heal.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Wait, I may heal. I won't forget about it.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll let you end your turn.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That is me.

[Referee (Landie)]
Very good. That guy's dead. Cannon, your turn.

[Machannan (James)]
Yep.

[Kamon (Heart)]
These guys just...

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh! That is a success. You think they're not working with your quips and stuff, like...

It's just not working, then... You pause a second, you get a little chuckle out of this game. This shadow as he...

It clicks, and...

[Machannan (James)]
Well, if that's going well, I should try it. You know what? That could be worse.

All things considered, that could be a problem.

[Referee (Landie)]
What weapon is your stratagem with?

[Machannan (James)]
That's with the gun. Yep. Let's go for it.

Back once... Oh, that's a hit! Shit!

[Referee (Landie)]
He did it. How do you want to do it?

[Machannan (James)]
Oh! Not as big as you thought it was. And then he laughs, and I shoot him.

I love that.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh! Oh, that tickled me really bad. Alright, um...

[Referee (Landie)]
He isn't level 4, it's just Meek, I think. The rest of you are like level 5 and 4?

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, I just got 4.

[Referee (Landie)]
6? 6. Okay, so Meek gets double.

Not even like Meek didn't do anything, like didn't get targeted this one. He survived two attacks, probably would have killed him if they hit. Impressive.

Nah, he's pretty durable for a Kinesis, he's pure constitution. You've earned your 120 XP. Uh...

What time is it? We get to keep going. So, if you didn't see my message in session times, in about 45 minutes I just need to have like...

It should only be like 15 minutes, I just have to drive down the road, grab a cake, come back.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Cool.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Gonna have your cake and eat it too? I will be eating it, yes.

Um... Of course, as far as doomed condition goes down, um... I assume you let it go down.

You can kill yourself if you want, but... That'd be pretty... Silly.

Uh, in the room... No, that room just has an encounter. Following this creaky hallway around, there is a rickety set of stairs leading to the top floor, and a locked door leading to a room.

Uh... Uh, it's down past where the shadow is.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You can...

[Referee (Landie)]
Walk.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Mimosa, do you mind taking the lead? I don't trust my... Feet around here.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm just gonna make a minute pass in time, so... Spell effects and things clear.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well then, after you.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I see, honey. Not you, not you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That was like, a little too perfectly timed, I'm sorry. Don't worry. I figured it was.

It wasn't.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh yeah, tripwires.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, the door to the north is locked, there's no tripwires down here.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay... Well... It's too bad Nova's not here to just break the door down.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, indeed.

[Referee (Landie)]
You can have a hero point for making me think about Nova. It's about time someone got one.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I feel like they've invented it up together that she would just get so used to Nova just barging the door in or breaking it down.

[Referee (Landie)]
Just has a look that she gives Nova and she does it. Um, three thievery checks please. EC 20.

Alright, I'll need three new thievery checks if you want to trade.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'll need three new thievery checks. No, somebody break this door down, it's a lost cause! I could try...

I would just need to borrow your toolkit.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'll try again.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No!

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
You need help? I can show you around.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Here, um... Hold on, I'll try to give you some encouragement. Give me a second.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I don't want to waste any hero points on this lock.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, just um... Here, enjoy... Uplifting a witcher.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's so rude.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, you've aided. You've got the prerequisite for aid roll there.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is that just a plus one?

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Someone needs to roll the aid check.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ah, alright, give me a sec. Performing... You can do it!

[Referee (Landie)]
That is a crit success, plus two. I guess that's to all of the checks, or...

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's... It's...

[Referee (Landie)]
With the task, this reaction, do you explain... To the triggering check... I assume all of them are the triggering check, so...

Uh, yeah. You get plus two to all of them. The triggering check would be the initial check, I believe.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Use lingering performance, make it last longer.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Sure. It's fine. I mean...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Here we go.

[Machannan (James)]
You know, one of my other parties, we had a pretty good team. They were pretty good.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, I think that was right. I think it's... Just the...

Um, first check, and I don't think lingering composition would change that, so... You can have plus two to the first check, Mimosa, and then... So if you just throw them all again...

You can add two to the first one. I hate adding modifiers and checks on... This.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You can do it. I'm currently fighting. It's like, ah, kill me, just give it to me, ah!

Alright. Ah!

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, Mimosa's banned from lockpicking. This is the last time! I can burn down a door.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Go ahead. Yes, at this point.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
No, no, no. You need your tiny little fingers, like my fingers. Look, look, look, look.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, go on.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh my gosh!

[Kamon (Heart)]
Christ, I... Are we gonna be bested by a door? Is it just one check, or is it...

[Referee (Landie)]
Three.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Three?

[Referee (Landie)]
But if you fail, you might as well give up, you know? And a door.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
And I'm gonna cast this at the door.

[Referee (Landie)]
It targets creatures. I don't think mine does.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm gonna step away from the door as people are trying to break it down. Go ahead, McKenna.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
One creature.

[Referee (Landie)]
Is a door a creature? I don't think so. I think it's a structure.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Could be if it was a mimic. That's how we find out.

[Referee (Landie)]
Fine.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I can destroy elements.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I think this one just refers to...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, please! Please!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have a crowbar, actually.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I have a crowbar.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I have a crowbar! I've got it!

[Machannan (James)]
Fine, you don't have a golden bar? Crowbar sucks!

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I think the crowbar's stuck on the door, you made it worse.

[Machannan (James)]
The crowbar pranked you. It's the first time I've broken a crowbar.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's never happened before. Well, we can't force it open anymore.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
How about this? How about we walk away and pretend this door never existed?

[Machannan (James)]
We should explore elsewhere. I fear the other shadows might come.

[Referee (Landie)]
That's a good point. I'm rolling a flat check.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I would be surprised, honestly. You've been so loud with this damn door.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I want to try to pick the lock. I want to see how that works out for me. I don't have thieves tools otherwise I would...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Well, well, well. Okay, you gotta make three. So two more, you can do it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, one more! No! You gotta start over!

That's a fail? No, no, no, no, no, I can just re-roll it. Give me a second.

Okay, there we go! Who's gonna lock the door? I have fooled at the fourth lowest.

This is great. Alright!

[Referee (Landie)]
In here is a chest, it is unlocked. There is a manuscript page. And...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Uh... Well, that was easy, I say. Pretending I didn't struggle that much.

[Referee (Landie)]
Is there anything else?

[Kamon (Heart)]
So, we see a manuscript?

[Referee (Landie)]
It is a page of the manuscript. This one is the title page.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, cool! How much do you see?

[Referee (Landie)]
Um... I'll add that to Kamen's sheet. And there is, uh...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ow!

[Referee (Landie)]
80 gold in the chest.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, lovely!

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, the page... I... have added to your sheet.

Just in the center of the page.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Thank you. I'll add the 80 gold to the party stat.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, please. My god, I can't believe that doll took so long.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I was like... Needed some luck there.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Three cheers for Hero Points! Five minutes of bullshit.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Didn't Vox Machina have trouble with doors, too?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah, theirs was way more embarrassing than this one, though, because I think they actually got it. It's not that much. Not by much!

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, yay. Hmm. I like to paint that.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Anything on the head?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, I can check. Fascinating type of thing. You are stepping on me, my dear.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Who, me? I'm not moving. I don't know why I'm moving.

Oh. No, I'm following you! What happened?

Why am I spicing it up?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Did you accidentally... Do we have mounters in here? Did you mount her?

Yes, Rideable is here. You accidentally mounted her. You are on a bed, so...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's awful.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Things aren't usually rideable by default, so I never expect things like that.

[Machannan (James)]
I said everything's rideable by default.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I like the game to mimic my personal life. That seems very intriguing. There's supposed to be a way to make it so you can follow someone with that one, but I've never figured out that.

Ah, yes, so...

[Referee (Landie)]
I've tried using the follow, and it lags the fuck out of the game.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That is so funny.

[Kamon (Heart)]
This room is cursed. Alright, out we go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, um... Yeah, there's nothing else about.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's the room. That room's cursed. Back to downstairs?

Yeah, I'm cursed. I'm really into her. Back to downstairs.

I imagine then this was the author's room. Perhaps that's why the door is so hard to unlock? You can hear a hint of amusement in the voice.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's an upstairs too, but... I feel like downstairs would be better. Are there stairs back there?

[Kamon (Heart)]
There's a hatch. So, we've explored all of this floor, yes?

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, you don't need to move to the hatch. Just let me... Oh, you haven't explored all the floor.

There's still one room to the, uh... Very...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Awesome.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, we'll get that one before we get down the hatch.

[Kamon (Heart)]
If it's locked, I'm leaving. I'll get the door this time. Is it locked?

[Referee (Landie)]
It's not locked in common. You spot a tripwire in here, and that covers the... Oh, actually, you need a flat shack.

Huh. Interesting.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is there a tripwire?

[Referee (Landie)]
There is a tripwire, that's definitely there. Uh, would you like to disarm it?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Uh, I'll try. Actually, you know what? Melissa!

You're here, why don't you try to...

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm gonna roll a thievery check, Melissa.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yes, my thievery checks have gone so well.

[Referee (Landie)]
Well, for disabling, they have.

[Kamon (Heart)]
There we go, see?

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, that's three disabled, uh, traps. You get a bit of XP for that. You have cleared some in the floor, you've found some stuff.

Uh... I think that's like 60 XP. Not 600.

Uh...

[Kamon (Heart)]
I would've claimed 600.

[Referee (Landie)]
One, two, three, four, five. Add. Jacob does not get XP.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Aww.

[Referee (Landie)]
Very good. Alright, you can delete all of the traps downstairs. You've dealt with them all.

That you've found. Uh... Let's see, you've been to the pool, you've been into the bathhouse.

Uh, yeah, you're good. You've finished down, uh, the, sorry, you've finished floor one. The ground floor.

Are you going downstairs now?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yes, down the hatch.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, so, uh, down the last, there's another final staircase leading up, um, where Carmen is. Um... But, going down, I will activate the scene in, uh, marching order.

The most up front.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Probably, yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
How about somebody else wants to go first? Heh.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ooh, no. I'll go second.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, any preference for the rest of you?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Nah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Um... You're gonna have to move out of the first room, because there's not physically enough room for you to all stand in the little hallway that this leads down to. Um, which you will see when I activate the scene.

Uh... I'm gonna squeeze Jacob and Ver into one square. Very good.

I'll activate the scene. Down a set of creaky stairs, uh, into the overwhelming darkness, you move down into the basement. Um...

Uh, there is a manuscript page at the, uh, bottom of the ladder. Oh, sorry, stairs. Ladder.

It's like one of those, like, stairs that extend out when you open it sort of thing. I don't know the logistics of making that happen with a trapdoor you pull up or something, but I'm not gonna think about it anymore.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
This ladder. Because we don't have...

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Let me give you this manuscript. We don't have attics or basements.

Yeah, we don't have basements, we don't have attics. I don't know any of that shit.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
We don't have insulation.

[Referee (Landie)]
We have crawl spaces.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
We don't have insulation. We have a wall. And a roof.

[Referee (Landie)]
I love not being a writer and not caring about this stuff too much. It's so great. Ignorance is bliss.

Um, who's picking up this manuscript page?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Was it my favorite book? It's a Thesaurus.

[Referee (Landie)]
Um... Vanessa probably would be. Alright, you've got page 40.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh.

[Referee (Landie)]
The big one.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
He's all the way in the back. I'll just read it for you, Ver. Ver saw the generator for the elevator.

She knew it could be fixed and lit. But the stain of the necromantic energies She's yelling down the hall. The stain of the necromantic energies were familiar to him.

He could sense the spirits that possessed the furnace. They would be mad when it was lit by the time the elevator would say... What?

They would be mad when it was lit by the ele... by the time... Anyway!

I need time, but I can cleanse the furnace. Please don't leave me unguarded while I do, Ver said. It did not take him long, but the spirits passed with slight encouragement.

The elevator is once again prepared. It's prepared. Oh.

Sorry.

[Referee (Landie)]
Beautiful. Thank you. I'm loving this.

I love making you read stuff.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
So this is your time to shine, Ver. Wherever we find it.

[Referee (Landie)]
You don't see any elevator mechanisms. To the south, Nessie, you do see a sarcophagus.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, that's... That's... Come and be careful.

There's a sarcophagus.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That door fucked me up, man.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You know, pat gently on the back. Okay, alright. There is a door to the left.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay. Where would we like to go? Left, right, sarcophagi?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
There's a sarcophagi. They say that the human heart is one of the great generators.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You can go first, then, into that room.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
That. I send Jacob in there.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I would stay back. There we go.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Does Jacob see anything in there?

[Referee (Landie)]
No, Jacob's find is he opened the sarcophagus. Or is that what you referred to in there?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Ah, sorry. Does he see anything in there before he opens it?

[Referee (Landie)]
Inside the sarcophagus is a piece of paper and a stone. Can Jacob communicate to you?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I believe he can mumble.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, he can understand. He can... Yeah.

He tells you that there is paper and stone. What's it say? What's it say?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
You have to talk like a skeleton. Do it right.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think he can read. Can he?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
He doesn't have eyes. Oh, we had fun with someone trying to play a pulpette character and their picture was someone with button eyes. They're like, oh, read this.

It's like, how do you read with button eyes? Magic.

[Referee (Landie)]
Jacob holds up the page for you to catch a glimpse of it. And you see that the page is not one of the manuscript pages. It's actually some kind of cursed page.

So you tell him to put it back. But you get the stone safely. You can have the cursed page if you want.

But... Do you take it off him?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
No.

[Referee (Landie)]
What would you like to do with it then?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I want him to keep it for the time being.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, you can add cursed page to Jacob's inventory.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Can I occultism that check? Or arcana it? Or recall knowledge?

[Referee (Landie)]
Sure, occultism or religion would be great for this. You aren't exactly sure on the nature of it, but with your arcana training, you pretty much figure out what it will do. Whatever energy has been imbued into the paper gets transferred to whoever touches it if they are able of reading it.

Luckily, Jacob can't, so he is safe to hold it. Not that you are doing this, but if you would like to ward off the haunt, you can do a religion check, or you can dispose of the paper with a thievery check to disable it. Okay, cool.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Perfect, perfect.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alrighty, there is a big locked door behind Mimosa there.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm changing my page.

[Referee (Landie)]
It does not have any means of picking it. It's like a vault door.

[Kamon (Heart)]
There's also a door to the left? Did, um... Did Mr. Jacob...

Sorry, did Jacob see anything else while he was in the sarcophagus room?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I don't know, but I'll go in there and check it out, if it doesn't look too bad.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Go for it.

[Referee (Landie)]
You've got a second stone that mirrors the stone Makanan has.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh.

[Referee (Landie)]
That is the only other thing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I suppose it would be wise to put them together, considering they're meant to ward off darkness. At least according to the story. That would be wise.

Wouldn't it?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Does having a pair of balls make me feel... Does having a pair of balls make me feel comfortable?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Makes most men comfortable.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ha ha. Alright. Ha ha.

Makanan has the other one, so you could ask Jacob to give it to Makanan while we clear the mirror. I should give it to Jacob, I think. Alright.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Go ahead.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Alright, I just... Did I get Jacob a blue sand hat?

[Referee (Landie)]
You have both the stones.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
It doesn't really have like a backpack, so you just put them in his pockets?

[Referee (Landie)]
You can put them in his eye sockets.

[Machannan (James)]
Ooh. Ha ha. Oh, I was thinking the iron giant.

I was 100% thinking just like hole in the bottom of the robe. All robes have holes in the bottom. Hole in the pocket would be good.

[Referee (Landie)]
The stones both have a spiral pattern on them. The... Yeah, they mirror each other.

That's how they're represented.

[Machannan (James)]
Do they look like they're combined?

[Referee (Landie)]
No, they don't fit together or anything like that. They definitely are a pair.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Do we know how many they're supposed to be?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I saw a pair, but I could have been wrong.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Can you stand that 5th inch person? Does putting them together do anything? Like, putting the spirals through each other?

[Referee (Landie)]
As Jacob collects them together, it makes a shiver run down your spine, but nothing happens.

[Machannan (James)]
There might be someone who can speak in this living.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Because it looks like there might be more towards it. Like, more towards it. It's not a pair, but a triplet.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Can I try something?

[Referee (Landie)]
You're pretty confident they're a pair.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Go for it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
She holds her hands out for the stones.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I guess I just need Jacob to give me the stones.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, once she has the stones, she turns on her halo. Can she feel the doomed condition go up?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes she can. You do notice something completely unrelated though. There is yellow paint on the ground leading into this room with arrows pointed.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, in we go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Opening the door with your magical light on, you see there are... on the... There are three doors on the opposite wall, and in this yellow paint that isn't visible with your light off, you can see that the middle door is labeled 1, the door on the left is labeled 3, and the door on the right is labeled 2.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think we have to open these in a specific order.

[Referee (Landie)]
Then you see more. There is a locked box over here. The box has a...

It's covered in this paint, and it has a 4-digit lock.

[Kamon (Heart)]
4-digit code?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
This is a weird-looking kitchen.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So 1... So 1, 3, 2... Alright, clue time!

I go to the locked box which has its 4 digits. I make the first one 2, the second one 1, and the third one 3. I guess we're going to have to find out what 4 is.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Hera is going to examine the door for traps. Secret perception?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, please. That's good. It is not trapped.

You open the door, and with that you also notice on the wall written in blood the numbers 8-1.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't think you put the right code in, Cameron.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, I suppose then we should check the rest of the doors, just in case. There's more clues there. I'll just open this door without checking for traps.

[Referee (Landie)]
We're just going to use Paras Check from before. You spot all the numbers in each room. The bottom room has 3, and the top room has 4.

[Kamon (Heart)]
8-1-4-3 8-1-4-3, Mimosa. 8-1-4-3?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Sure. Oh, am I right by the little pad?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. You went straight to it.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright, I put in that combo.

[Referee (Landie)]
Let's see. There is a bunch of jewelry, 200 gold worth of jewelry in the books, and a manuscript page.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Did you put in the amount of gold?

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm adding it in now. I'll let you know when. I have added it in.

You have page 52.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
The Everafter Stones and the Typewriter were reunited. Finally, the heroes could move beyond the basement to their destinations. They knew to be careful.

The reality they create must have balance. There cannot be triumph without hindrance. But the darkness was close.

It would stop at nothing to achieve its goals. What? That's really cool.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, so I imagine we'd best get a move on before the living darkness gets us, let's speak. Yes.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
So we gotta find a typewriter. We haven't seen a room that had a typewriter in it.

[Referee (Landie)]
You have not.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
But we know it's in the basement.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Is there anything in these prisons?

[Referee (Landie)]
Some bones and crap, nothing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That interesting. Oh yeah, you do. Oh, can you also see the para that is here that is a ghost?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I can't even select it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, because it's just a little ghost token. I don't know what happens, but it happens to me all the time.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So funny. Alright, door time! Secret perception check.

Is the door devious?

[Referee (Landie)]
It is not devious.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sick. I opened the door without any thought to the latter. Ooh, is this the generator?

[Machannan (James)]
It is.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Sick. Alright, we know what to do.

[Machannan (James)]
Fur!

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Wait, one sec, one sec.

[Referee (Landie)]
If you need another look at the page so you know what to say as a player, then I can post it again.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I think that was page 40?

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh yeah, posted it in chat for you. If it's not exactly what you would say, you can paraphrase it.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Hey, I show you know what to do because I know what to do. I need some time, but I can cleanse the furnace. Please don't leave me unguarded while I do.

[Referee (Landie)]
That would be a check, but we already know that you succeed. You... get a hero point as well for playing along.

And you fix the furnace that powers this pulley system. I don't know engines. It's just a simple winch and it gets powered by steam probably like every generator does.

The elevator lights up, the buttons begin to work, and you get attacked by shadows. But as you cleanse the furnace, a bunch of fiery spirits pour out as you disable the trap that was there. I say trap, but it's more of a haunt.

But yeah, Fur has no trouble doing it. It comes naturally to you. But yeah, shadows attack you.

We're gonna have initiative.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Fur does have like a plus 13 crafting.

[Referee (Landie)]
Make it look like it comes second nature to you. Probably does come second nature to you. Can I roll initiative crafting?

I like that, sure. It's not very often I'll let you roll initiative crafting, but this time, absolutely. Uh, would McCannon be closer to the room?

[Machannan (James)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright. I'm gonna get ganked by yourself. Oops, I sent him too far.

[Machannan (James)]
No, I dragged myself at the same time and it works on, for some reason, it works on like momentum.

[Referee (Landie)]
Incredibly funny that that happens, I'm glad. I hope it's still like that in V13.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, no, that's... We should have good bugs. We should have only good bugs.

[Referee (Landie)]
What, Bethesda bugs?

[Machannan (James)]
Ironically, yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, now make sure he has common languages with you this time. Uh... Language, common.

Haldane, added. Update character. Um, okay, he would move through that wall there, he moved through the door, and he moved through the wall here.

Alright, you see your big boy that, uh... The other two are just the same as the ones you were fighting before. He isn't much bigger, but he is scarier, definitely.

But it is not the big boy that's going first. It's the one next to McCannon. Are we missing anyone?

We have Meek, McCannon, or... Uh... I'll let you keep your 24.

What? Because it wasn't an initiative check, you were just looking for stuff before, and you noticed this guy coming through the wall. Which means you get to roll initiative.

Uh, it is his turn though, and he is going to walk up to you and hit you. But he misses. My god, these guys suck.

Ah, fuck, I should have waited, it's time for me to go. Uh, we're gonna before we get into this combat, we're gonna take a short break. Everyone grab drinks and ponder your life decisions and think about how much I suck, and then don't think about that because that would hurt my feelings when I get back.

No, kidding, kidding. I have a... the opposite of fragile ego, I promise.

Uh, anyway, I'm gonna head off for like, hopefully 15 minutes. I'll give you an update when I have the cake, and I'm on my way back home. And I'll be back.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okie dokie. Best of luck.

[Referee (Landie)]
Thank you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, in this gap of time, quick question, can we add new soundboard effects?

[Machannan (James)]
What kind of soundboard? I don't see why not. What kind of sound?

I don't know.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I haven't decided yet, but one of them.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
There's a soundboard?

[Kamon (Heart)]
There is, but you only get... you can only add stuff if you're... have permission for it.

And the add sound has been calling my name for weeks, but I haven't touched it.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Is this in Foundry or Discord? Oh, Discord. Oh.

I'm looking all over Foundry. It's like, when did they add a soundboard?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Retro sound.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Hey James.

[Machannan (James)]
Hello!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Can I bully you into adding Monk's active tiles?

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, sure. Do you know what that is?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's a module in Foundry.

[Machannan (James)]
I guess.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's similar to the Foundry's default regions, but it has more options, and I miss them sorely.

[Machannan (James)]
I'm not a big fan.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Pretty sure we have... Yes, we understood that, clearly.

[Machannan (James)]
That's another thing that's just, like, better.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
That soundboard works. I've counterspelled in Kool-Aid Man.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You know, I've never heard the Kool-Aid Man soundboard get clicked. I didn't realize it would be that deep.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Have you ever seen the Kool-Aid Man commercials?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I have, but I don't know. Ah, Jesus Christ.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
The Kool-Aid... I think you were talking about... Oh, yeah.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Kool-Aid Man was so popular, I think they tried to come up with a cartoon for it. I think that was the 80s, and they made cartoons of any game.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
My girlfriend and stuff, I'm just gonna go say good morning. Can someone just message me? I'll help my family.

Can someone message me when he's back?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Goodnight.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I'm back.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Bonjour.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Anybody read Meek's cookbook yet?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, not yet. Did you put it in your character chat?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Yeah, the character creation thing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, I'll take a look.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
It's based on the recipes he has for his archetype. Or his dedication.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, fun. Did you write these all yourself? It's very nice.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I had some help from ChatGTP, because I was like, give me a list of fantasy ingredients. I'm like, okay, I can work with these. Some sound really gross, but...

I pull some random cookbook stuff, I'm like, okay, that looks like a proper dose of pixie something. Landing at the worst kind of quest. A fetch quest.

[Machannan (James)]
I need to upload every day from yesterday, and I need to do today. Oh, god, you have no idea how satisfying it is to be back on these. I don't know why I didn't try this earlier, just like, hm.

What if I just start back where I left off? What if I just pick up where I left off? Because every other time I try doing like, oh, let me start from 001 again.

I'm going to stop really soon. What's this one called? Type on...

Hm, while you're here, you should roll your... a kingdom activity.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, uh, hm. Alright. Going to have to look up how to do that.

Oh, I was going to ask what you use to make your art.

[Machannan (James)]
So this is, it's kind of spurious, but this is Chaotica and Cinema 4D. Chaotica generates fractals, which is a lot of fun. And Cinema 4D is motion graphics animation software.

Primarily used by a lot of people who do like short, like looking for really high quality, but often short-term renders. So people doing like full-length movies, I think usually use stuff like SFM or well, not usually SFM, but like stuff like Blender is going to be a lot more common. Whereas people doing commercials and stuff like that see a lot more use of Cinema 4D.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm going to look up what sort of checks I need to roll for kingdom activities.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, so you're on the council. You can safely assume, I think, that other people on the council are handling a lot of like the mundane stuff.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright. I'm not declaring war. Who would I declare war against?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's a list of actions in the kingdom itself. I don't know which one you're a part of.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That would be Bronloch.

[Machannan (James)]
Other parties. And there's two kingdom sheets. Leadership 2 for players, so you can do two of them.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, that's cool. I hadn't realized those then. Okay, that's cool.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I almost made a huge mistake. I just got food. And I just fed my cat.

And I almost used my cat's food board for my food.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Hey, if it hasn't killed your cat yet, it won't kill you. No, but I don't think it would taste very good.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
What?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I don't know, you see how picky cats are?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Uh, not all cats are picky, but yeah.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Out of my two cats, one loves canned food, and the other one loves their dry food.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Have they been in cats their whole life?

[Referee (Landie)]
Answer the question.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, lady's back.

[Referee (Landie)]
I am back, hello.

[Kamon (Heart)]
How was the cake?

[Referee (Landie)]
I haven't eaten it yet. So it's a cake that's actually, so it's this one guy that makes wedding cakes, he does like a sampler cake that has like, I assume he makes like 8 cakes and then like cuts them all into like slices and then makes boxes of like 8 different cakes, so you have a slice of each cake in the box.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, so it's the picking cake.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, yep, that. And we get to try all of them, and some of them sound awful, and some of them sound pretty good. There's one that's lavender and earl grey, and...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Ooh, that's so good, I love that combo.

[Referee (Landie)]
I hate it. I've already tried it, and it was, I did not like it at all.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Have you tried it in tea form though? Because that is going to be different.

[Referee (Landie)]
Tea, probably, great. As a cake, no.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I enjoy eating perfume, so, um, there is that.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
She does, she's a freak.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You would love it then. My favorite flavor is rose, so.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Well, laugh off it.

[Referee (Landie)]
There's a red velvet cake that has rose in it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, that sounds divine.

[Referee (Landie)]
No clue. I'll give updates after each one I've eaten.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Mine was like, mine was lemon, some form of lemon, I don't remember what the bottom layer was. I just remember the layer that my dad accidentally ruined.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think it was, um, pink champagne, I want to say?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, maybe, maybe, yeah. Oh my gosh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, because James is always in the upper corner when he has his camera on, sometimes I'll be clicked onto another server and think I'm on this one, and get really confused by the conversation that's going on. And Nessie's in a server talking, so she knows exactly which one I'm getting confused by.

[Referee (Landie)]
Live James reaction.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's just very funny to see super dick right next to James.

[Referee (Landie)]
You're muted, James, I'm sorry. Not on Discord, though. My finger has healed enough to take my bandaid off, I'm so happy.

Never trust me with a potato peel or I go too wild.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's worse things you could cut yourself on.

[Referee (Landie)]
I cut myself all the time, because I work with a lot of glass and stuff, and metal things, and there'll just be, like a teacher won't tell me they have broken glass in the box they return to me, like, oh, thanks, cool. The worst I had was, we had these pipettes that are really fine glass, and one of them snapped while I was cleaning them, and it snapped right to my index finger bone. I was like, oh.

Things should not touch my bones, except the things that are supposed to. Probably should have had a tetanus shot from that, but anyway. That was all clean.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
My dad used to work in a kitchen, and his pet peeve was when people would just throw knives into the water.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, I hate that. I hate, like...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And he actually quit over that, because there was one person who would just do it all the time. And, like, it would always be knives that were on plates, so it would be like, the knife part would be actually facing the person who's grabbing.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And nobody would do anything. I think they ended up getting shut down, because someone ended up getting a really serious cut from that exact thing.

[Referee (Landie)]
Jeez.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So.

[Referee (Landie)]
You could have seen that coming.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Knife safety is such a big thing in our household. Oh, which part did you push?

[Kamon (Heart)]
What happened in the last five minutes? Someone was leaving the house, so I had to say goodbye.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh. I was just talking about how my dad, when he worked at a restaurant, cleaning dishes, his pet peeve was whenever someone would throw a knife into the dishwater, because there's a bunch of bubbles, so you can't see that there's a knife in there. And they're not supposed to, I guess.

Protocol? Yes. But protocol was to put the knives to the side so that it was visible.

But people kept throwing it just straight into the dishwater. And, you know, my dad got sick and tired of it, quit the job. And then like a few weeks later, they ended up getting shut down because someone cut themselves really bad from the dishwater knife.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, well, well.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. Dad's really picky about knife safety, for a good reason, I feel like.

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right. Give me one second. The cat is trying to escape.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, that sounds like it was awful.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hold on.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, he is just chilling up by my pillow.

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right. Was it like a week later that the knife incident happened? Sounds like a couple of weeks later.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
But you found out from someone who he was still friends with who worked there.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Was it shut down forever or just a while? I think it was just temporary.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Temporary shutdown to get your shit in order and train your employees.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, temporary. Yeah.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
They're like, yeah, retrain, make it stick. Because they could have been trained and just not cared. Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think that's the biggest problem is like a lot of people, especially servers, are trying to go so fast that they just don't care.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Which like you could. Yeah. I was going to say you could have a like a bin or a bucket dedicated for the knife.

They did. Yeah, I was just gonna say you'd have to care.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It was closer than the dish wire.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's crazy. That's stupid. Those people needed to be fired.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's what I never get about people and jobs like that, where it's like, why? It would be so easy for you to just not. And yet you persist.

Oh, we're still waiting on Ver. Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
We'll give him a bit longer.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
Otherwise the scene can be retconned while he's fixing the machine things attack.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, he did say we have to cover him.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
So nice that I was able to predict that happening.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Whoa, hey, wait, hang on. Rosie, Hugo. Let her take a drink first.

Let her take a drink first, please. Where are you getting that? Is that for mom and dad's room?

From your bedroom, huh?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What did she grab?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's something that I saw Rosie grab it looks like a ribbon. And I don't know how ribbon. We'd be in.

I. Sorry, that wasn't to you. I wasn't.

No, I know. This from my ribbon stash. Hair, hair yourself.

Go out. Hey, honey. Rosie did get that from my box.

Make sure, like, just stay out of my room. Out. Out.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I suppose of things that children have grabbed from their parents room ribbon is probably one of the better ones.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah, I suppose it's better than the fancy crafting scissors I had.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, come out to all of them having cut their hair.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's your water of choice, buddy. It's purple, who would have thought. Yes, it's purple.

This will do.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hello, did anything exciting happen within the last five minutes.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Waiting over.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, I mean, my kids got into the ribbons that's about it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Did you free them from their ribbony capture?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Nope, they're lost to the cause. They're wrinkled and crinkled and ruined.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alas, alas.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's fine. Uh, just kidding. It was the children.

No, shit. No, the ribbons.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Your punishments are severe. Holy crap.

[Machannan (James)]
I can always start over. Make another kid.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, where's your peanut butter and jelly sandwich. All of it. Even the crust.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
He exits the alleyway. There will be able to make a right turn and head into the gate area. Thank you for remaining seated.

I will turn on the seatbelt sign once we park at the gate. Until that time, please remain seated. Welcome to New York.

That's a beautiful evening here. About 70 degrees right now.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Let the abuse start. Come on. You can't let him get away with that.

[Machannan (James)]
Welcome to New York. What was the temperature again?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Where's our gate? If it hurts, it's too tight. Okay.

Can you go put the jelly in the fridge, please? No, no, no. The jar of jelly.

Can you go put it in the fridge, please?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So much for having his phone on.

[Machannan (James)]
Maybe he means a direct message.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I don't know.

[Machannan (James)]
He's not a person.

[Referee (Landie)]
I don't see how a direct message would be any different. Unless he has all pings muted on here, which would be silly.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
The jelly. The jelly, please. I mean, he should also be keeping track of shit.

[Machannan (James)]
What I should do is I should make a, I should make different roles for like, like old adventures. Like, Hey, this is like, to let you know the new campaign is starting versus like people who actively want to be pinged about like sessions, individual sessions are starting. That'd be Andy.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah. I think, I think if you change the old one, the current role to be the old one, and then you make a new one for the current players to opt into, that'd work.

[Machannan (James)]
That'd be perfect.

[Referee (Landie)]
That way. Yeah.

[Machannan (James)]
Campaign updates.

[Referee (Landie)]
I've sent her a message. I did say in the message that we're going to get started again. So I wouldn't want to lie.

I think we will get started again.

[Kamon (Heart)]
The rest of you are okay with that.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm fine with it. I can warm it up. How do you ask?

[Referee (Landie)]
I can just take control of her actually. Well, you don't all die. I believe the shadow had just gone attacking McKenna.

[Machannan (James)]
I don't think that did actually attack me.

[Referee (Landie)]
Is that private?

[Machannan (James)]
Oh, he missed.

[Referee (Landie)]
Last thing in chat is a hit. He did nine damage. And then, then I ran off.

[Machannan (James)]
Which is private. I can see it. I can see the nine damage, but I can't see the roll.

Yeah, that's just secret. You can activate your own mystery damage for a little bit of added psychological torture.

[Referee (Landie)]
No one gets to know my damage, not even me. Marissa, it is your turn.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I realize that was probably one of your children, but for a second, I thought you just yelled at this thing.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, no. Rosie has the fake vampire teeth, so I was scared.

[Referee (Landie)]
That is pretty scary.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's okay. They're purple, and it's terrifying when you're not paying attention. You see out of the corner of your eye, and you're like, oh, there's something wrong with your mouth.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
They could be red. That could make it worse.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah. I also threw most of them away because I kept stepping on them, and they're akin to Legos, or like a D4. And I was getting so pissed off.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oops. I clicked the wrong button.

[Machannan (James)]
I've been whispered at.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm going to delay Viya until the end of the round, just in case he does get back. And let's see how we go.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, I'm definitely not going to start off with an attack.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
God, you are not. Have you ever had a success with Devise's stratagem?

[Machannan (James)]
I used to all the time. Lost fight.

[Referee (Landie)]
Lost fight, the last one was. The end of the fight.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You need, like, Karmic Dice. Jeez.

[Referee (Landie)]
The debuff from that changes nothing, it's still success. Oh, no, it does speak the language. No, you're good.

She has the language with you now, I fixed it. My brain's slightly bigger than before.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, we already did the Devise's stratagem. Who's next is... Diversion.

No, uh... Faint is what I'm looking for, I think.

[Referee (Landie)]
Faint would put him off guard if it succeeds. That is for melee attacks.

[Machannan (James)]
That's okay. I'm going to finish up with Bomb Bomb.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh!

[Machannan (James)]
So close. All right, that is... the end of my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. C'mon. Are you muted, Heart?

We understand what's happening, though, don't worry.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sorry, my voice gave out for a second. Yes, Linkering Composition did. Ugh, fail.

That was a good one.

[Referee (Landie)]
We need a handshake meme between Lingering Composition and Devise's stratagem of failing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We'll torment this guy, in particular. Oh, wait, no, I can't do that one again. Ignore that attack.

Whoops.

[Referee (Landie)]
You're out of second-level slots?

[Kamon (Heart)]
No, no, no, I can't use... Because this is from a staff, so I shouldn't be able to use it again. Ignore that.

But! I can use this again.

[Referee (Landie)]
Am I missing my third-level spells?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hm?

[Referee (Landie)]
Does Kamin have third-level spells?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, level 5.

[Referee (Landie)]
You know what?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm going to go check.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, you have two spell lists. Oh, I was looking at your wrong spell list. Ah.

Um.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
It just says, like, wait, do you not have third-level spells prepared? You do. I get to roll that save.

Success.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, boo. Well, that was slow.

[Referee (Landie)]
The pointlessness that exists.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And then I end my turn. Okay, I'm going to blink my halo on.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think that flashbang's all of them. What is your...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, 22 is my spell DC.

[Referee (Landie)]
Fail. Success. Success.

He has stunned the two out with doing the cannon and stunned one. The one inside has stunned two. It doesn't get a turn next round because of this load.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, and then I am going to cast a holy light upon the big guy. Because I don't like him.

[Referee (Landie)]
Good decision. Um. I'll make him roll the save again in case he gets worse.

But it doesn't stack like Fryden. No, it is like Fryden, but it doesn't stack. It's just if he gets worse, he gets...

Oh, wow. Um. Okay, he's fine.

He still just stunned one, but he... The light from the spells burn away the shadow that protects him, as he takes the full damage from that. Which is a lot.

Oh my god, it's a lot. Um, he has less than half his health. Is that sanctified?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um. I don't know.

[Referee (Landie)]
Doesn't matter.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It is holy.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think that just... I don't think it... I don't understand how sanctified works.

He doesn't have a weakness to sanctified damage, though. So it doesn't matter.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. If he has the unholy trait, he takes the extra spirit damage, but...

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, okay. So yes, he does take the spirit damage. Yes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Um.

[Referee (Landie)]
Now that's your last two actions, I believe.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes. Um. Does it do anything about the darkness?

Probably not. Uh. Uh.

Not really.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, it's his turn. He is still on the run, so he loses an action. What does he do?

He's just like the others, but it's harder. He's gonna fly up to Hera and take a swing at you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, that's fair.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh no, he ends his turn in the light. Whoop. So I made it back before his turn, excellent.

Uh. This shadow gets skipped, because he has stunned two. And he is slowed one.

I believe the slow ends after his turn. Is that right, Comet?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, when his turn ends, the slowness disappears, because he's only mildly saddened.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay. He ends his turn in the light as well. Sucks to be him.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Meek.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's your turn.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Gotta protect the guy playing with the generator. So he'll summon another Timber Sentinel. Right in that square, right of Jacob.

[Referee (Landie)]
So cover all spells.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I tried dragging the thing over there. He's been doing his intro. With my, uh, spell.

So, my last action, I will... Throw a Fire Blast at the one... To the upper right of me.

Yup. And Miss Orbly. I can probably reroll that.

[Referee (Landie)]
There we go. Doing surprisingly well for a level, what, two or three character against... Creatures that are a bit higher than you.

Max damage. Very good. He should never resist that, if you can see that.

Very good. That's all of your turn? Uh, let me make sure.

Yep. Alrighty. We get back to the...

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Yep, so Jacob will run up, and he'll do an attack. Yep. Strike.

Missing. I'm having no luck with that at all. And then I'll do a Slashing Gust.

Also missing.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright. This guy was stunned one, he has two actions left. He is currently in the light.

Uh... He is going to... Attack McKenna with his first action.

With a miss. And flee into the shadows through the wall with his second. As he goes through the wall.

Mimosa. You killed this guy with that last one, very nice.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Um... What is this square?

[Referee (Landie)]
That's a protecting tree, it's your friend. It intercepts hits that come toward you.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
I kind of like it.

[Machannan (James)]
Let's go!

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I've heard it in the chat, so you can read it.

[Machannan (James)]
I'll make sure to scroll all the way down. Hey, that's not so bad. Not bad at all.

Uh, let's demoralize him first. Yeah. Yeah, burn a little bit of bomb off, you know?

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh my god. The... For when you attack this man with your divisor stratagem.

You have played this perfectly. The Brighton gets his AC low enough that you hit him, I believe.

[Machannan (James)]
And, oh, let me apply the uh... Can you apply the effective bomb not to him?

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, yeah, it's on him.

[Machannan (James)]
Ah, sweet, yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
He has a little speech bubble.

[Machannan (James)]
And now... What's that? Yes?

Plus 12? Yeah, it's plus 12. I guess 12 to this invader, that sucks.

Is he in the magical level?

[Referee (Landie)]
He is.

[Machannan (James)]
Ah. No, not from penalty land. That sucks.

That's okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, sorry. I was off by one. Sad.

[Machannan (James)]
He's... Guys, he's weak to wisdom right now.

[Referee (Landie)]
Cannon. Not my cannon. Uh, cannon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Retain these 12 units. We're gonna see if lingering composition works again. We'll see if we'll have to...

Thank the stars.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It works extra good today.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yay. And when this guy is injured. No.

No, no, no. I'll just shoot him a little bit.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, we move to power. Power, do you continue shedding your light?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I think so.

[Referee (Landie)]
You move to doomed 2. Uh, when you do that, he gets to roll his save against it again. He...

What is your DC?

[Kamon (Heart)]
22.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, it is a success, but he's been in the light for a full round, so it makes it one worse to a failure. He gets stunned 2.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Good job. I'm going to step out of the way. Over here, and then I'm going to Neen Barton.

Okay.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh my gosh. Prick.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And that was my turn, I will end it.

[Referee (Landie)]
Here. His turn. He is stunned 2, he gets one action.

He's going to attack Mimosa. Just off a crit, the frighten saved you. 15 void damage as he slaps you.

Move to make.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I see you. He will try to blast it.

[Machannan (James)]
What's up?

[Referee (Landie)]
Well done. It dies. That's terrifying, baby.

Hide your guard.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, yes, good job, dear.

[Referee (Landie)]
There's one left, it is hiding.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I'll just say, uh... Hold an attack. He has one right at the door.

Yeah. I can end with one action, can't I?

[Referee (Landie)]
You can hold one action.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Hello? Hello? I'll hold a...

I might torch at him and Jake will hold a strike if you have it nearby.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yep.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, his turn. First action, it moves back through the door and attacks me. Second, it will attack my cannon.

It moves into the magical light. Fails. It is stunned 2.

Which will apply on its next turn. Uh... It makes an attack at my cannon.

Misses. Lost action. Back through the door.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Sure. Delay.

[Referee (Landie)]
Can you do that?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Delay.

[Referee (Landie)]
I can't. Cannon, there we go. Uh, yep.

You've spent 2 actions.

[Machannan (James)]
3? Huh?

[Referee (Landie)]
You can't break up your movement. You have to stride. Open the door, stride.

So you would be currently... At the end of your second action, you're standing there. Yeah.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Come down to the tree. The word of mourning will protect you.

[Machannan (James)]
That's okay. That's okay. I wanted to do something else anyways.

Mostly because I can't have the cannon. Yes! She's gonna kill the fuck out of me.

I hope you understand that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And it's technically in the light again, right?

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, it's not in the bright light. You would need to be closer. So it's currently stunned from entering your light.

But it's not... It doesn't have its resistance negated. Uh, is he immune to your Demoralize?

I think he is. Thank you, Demor... You did it to him before.

[Machannan (James)]
Is it the same guy? 24 hour cooldown.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm pretty sure you did him in the first round. Might be one hour. Might still.

[Machannan (James)]
It should've applied immunity to him then.

[Referee (Landie)]
He does have immunity. Which is what I'm saying. Would you like to use your action to do something else?

[Machannan (James)]
I would, I would. I'm so sorry, everybody.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's okay. It's all good. You're giving me time to change the diaper.

[Referee (Landie)]
He hasn't been bon-modded yet. Uh, and just for your reference, Bon-mod is really good before Demoralize because it lowers their Will DC. But uh, Bon-mod's really good too.

I love Bon-mod. My favorite was your shoes are untied and they're like, what? My shoes don't even have laces.

Uh, we move to Mimosa, who was delayed.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yep, one moment please.

[Referee (Landie)]
Would you like to delay until after Para?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Uh, no. I'm almost done. Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think he's saying so I can move forward and get, um... No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Well, I mean, if that's what you want to do, then fine. I don't know what's going on. I've been changing the poopy diaper.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think you should.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, then I delay.

[Referee (Landie)]
Would Carmen like to delay until after Mimosa? I mean, sorry, after. After, yeah.

After Mimosa.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sorry?

[Referee (Landie)]
Would you like to go after Para or before Para?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I don't mind going before Para.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh! To delay so Para can just kill the guy. No, yeah, go ahead.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Not kill. Uh, make it easier to kill.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, I need to hit the delay button.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, I've got it, I've got it. Got it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Go get her.

[Referee (Landie)]
Para's turn.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
One to move up, one to open door.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, he's in the light again.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. Um, and then I will cast a little shield upon myself.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... He wasn't in it at the start when you sustained it, so he doesn't roll a new save. He is stunned still.

You go to doomed three.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh!

[Referee (Landie)]
I think doomed... Is it doomed four or five where you die?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's doomed four.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Doomed four would be where I would die, so next round I'm not sustaining it. But that's fine, because Mimosa still goes on to zero.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Unless she has Die Hard.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I know CPR.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Doesn't help if you can't do it. I think I'd rather just go to the boneyard.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Although, if Para goes unconscious, she'll die.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No, no. If her dying result goes to zero, like, she gets doomed four, she just dies.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
No, no, but when you fall down, you get dying one, which means you've reached maximum death.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Either way, she's ending it next round, so it doesn't matter. Are you back to your turn? Yes, sorry.

Okay. I said what I said. I also did a boo-boo.

I can't... I wonder if I... Oh, she had health!

Damn it. Come on.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Re-enter initiative. Alright, um... We're going to move, because I can't see the guy.

Wait a second, there we go. This will be one action. And then...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No, no.

[Kamon (Heart)]
The darts have been useful so far, why not? Ech, a miss. I shall let it be.

That's the end of my turn.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Ha, why never hit her? Ha, hit her! See you!

He will try to... Change it up, and summon a piece of wood.

[Referee (Landie)]
Chuck it at him really hard. I think you've hit them with a Vitality one yet. You should do it.

Not that it matters now. Eh, wouldn't be hurt if a big ball of green energy hits it. Eh, I can try Vitality.

Oh, the Splinter one isn't Vitality, is it? I didn't realize you had one.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
No, the wood one.

[Referee (Landie)]
The wood one lasts either bludgeoning or Vitality.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Eat living energy, Shadow. Very nice. That was just a hit.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ha! Uh, that didn't apply properly. It's bad luck, of course.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Because he just switched it on accident.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, it did? Ah, crap, it didn't switch it over. That's okay.

Unless it would have been better damage on the other one. Nah, I think that's the same. Ah, so good.

The Vitality would bypass their resistance if they weren't in the way. But that doesn't matter. Uh, I think you're all done with that one.

Yep, we move to the...

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Alrighty. Seeing that my companion is still going strong, I'm gonna go up to here and... Don't worry, I'll eliminate the way.

And I'll pass by and take a run for it. Take a run for 15 feet up here. Up here.

Take a run for 5 feet. So that'll be my 4 turns. Nope, 3 turns.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, Storm 2. I think it's gonna take a swing at the Mercer and remain in the light. What's its turn?

Cannon. It is unguarded. Holy shit.

[Machannan (James)]
I would have so loved for that to be a quick crit. Unless...

[Referee (Landie)]
One off. So bad.

[Machannan (James)]
That's sad. If only I didn't fuck up my... 8 damage with...

I don't know what Bane ammunition does.

[Referee (Landie)]
I think you pick a creature type.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Yeah, so you have a different trait type that you Bane the ammunition against, and it generally has an effect against that creature. So the Lord of the Pines is 1d4 against that. Yeah, so that's like a 1d4 damage bonus against the Undead based on the type of Bane.

I believe it's normally like a poison.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Undead isn't an option for it, unfortunately. Right, if it's poison then they're immune.

Alright. Cannon's a little... Nevermind.

[Machannan (James)]
I will mark it as off-guard to... Mimosa. Wait, no!

I mark it as off-guard to Para. Mimosa's right next to it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Mark it as Mimosa.

[Referee (Landie)]
That's really good for Mimosa.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mark it as Mimosa. Off-guard doesn't do anything for me. Okay.

Oh shit! Damn it, Ver! Sorry, I just realized Ver just fucked up my action.

Why?

[Kamon (Heart)]
What'd I do?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You put the Undead right in my float zone!

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I put it in your what?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You put it in my zone!

[Machannan (James)]
So what's the zone?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was gonna heal...

[Machannan (James)]
That's fine, go for it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was gonna healing blast it.

[Machannan (James)]
Go for it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
He's gonna die!

[Machannan (James)]
No he won't.

[Referee (Landie)]
Para, you drop your halo?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I do drop my halo, yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Protector's fine, I've still got it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I am going to use directed channel to do a 60ft cone instead. Oh actually wait, no, I can just do this. Then I miss him.

Huzzah!

[Referee (Landie)]
You don't heal party members. You only heal Mechana and all yourself doing that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I heal Mimosa, right?

[Referee (Landie)]
You heal Mimosa.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, that's the one I'm concerned about.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, so they get a forward save.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean I guess if he's okay with me hitting his skeleton, I could heal everyone and myself. So yeah, maybe instead of doing the directed, I will do the 30ft if you're so sure. Yes, fortitude save for the two undead.

My teeth isn't that, I guess.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's how much I heal, I guess.

[Referee (Landie)]
It obliterates in the holy white. I mean it takes no damage. Did you do the heal instead of harm version?

Either way, it kills him. The macro didn't work.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Gone. And then anyone else who's also injured takes that 19.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
So Mechanon...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And I think that's everyone. And then Jacob also has to roll the fortitude save, unfortunately.

[Referee (Landie)]
I don't know if the party here is level 4. Meek is level 2, so of course it is getting doubled.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Meek will reach god-like level 3.

[Referee (Landie)]
Despite this being a level 5 encounter, Parablit's the creature level 7 enemy. Didn't really feel like it, but that's sick. I didn't auto-assign that, so you'll just need to click the little ad in chat next to it.

You should have.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I know Jacob's looking slightly banged up.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Can Jacob eat? I have Godfarad.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Not if it's vitality.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Jacob looks at your tasty flesh. Haha. Stocks for zero, I ain't got the space.

[Referee (Landie)]
In this room there is a manuscript page over on the desk. Who's picking it up?

[Machannan (James)]
I shall pick it up!

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll add it to your inventory. Page 44. Who has the stones currently, Parablit?

[Machannan (James)]
I have one of the stones.

[Referee (Landie)]
Whoever has- someone has both of them. I've moved them from the cannon's inventory to Parablit's. I have a pair of stones.

[Machannan (James)]
Ah, sorry. After a brief ride up the elevator, Meek could feel the trap that waited for the group in the next room. The antithesis shows that Goblin is silent.

Be careful ahead, I don't like it when it gets quiet. The crackling of fire soothes me, Meekshad. The cannon leans down and moves when he iterates, Meekshad.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Ah, a paper nose man. I do like the fire. There's a trap up here?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Up the elevator.

[Referee (Landie)]
How are y'all doing? Happy to keep playing?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Mhm. I'm good.

[Machannan (James)]
I do want to, uh, I do want to go to work. At about ten. So, in about...

Jeez, I probably wouldn't leave. I could do like another encounter. Alright.

[Referee (Landie)]
Depending on how things go, there's only one or two more encounters left, so... And I think you have a pretty good idea of where it is now, too.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Upstairs, let's go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Take the elevator up?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Take the elevator up. I think we have everything... Wait, did we find the typewriter?

That's what did one of the things we needed to grab.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Unless beyond the basement means something different that I didn't know.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Would we need a, Landy, would we need a secret perception check to check to see if we can see the typewriter in here?

[Referee (Landie)]
The typewriter's not down on this floor, you've searched everywhere.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. Off we go, then.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
If we're going upstairs, just let Landy take us there.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, there's nowhere else on this map you can go. I need to change the scene. I'm just looking at what I told you.

I didn't tell you anything incorrect, you've made a misassumption about the story. It's fine. Where would you like to take the elevator to?

Floor one will take you to the stop near the back garden. But you can take it all the way up to floor two if you'd like.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Why does it go to floor two? We haven't been here.

[Referee (Landie)]
This room was designed with...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Love.

[Referee (Landie)]
I can't guarantee that, because I didn't make the map. It's been designed with enough space for you all, at least. Jacob goes underneath there.

And McCannon. I activate the scene, and... Meek, you're up.

You feel the trap in the next room. This is a room? Behind the door, you feel the trap waiting.

Be careful ahead.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I like it when it gets quiet. Crackling fire serves me.

[Referee (Landie)]
Excellent. Have a hero point.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Meek will check the door. Is it unlocked? It's unlocked.

[Referee (Landie)]
Opening the door, a wave of silence washes over all of you. I should have targeted you all with that. Where'd Meek go?

Is he underneath McCannon? There he is. Thank you.

Technically this will silence Jacob, but I don't think that does anything mechanically, so I'm not going to bother. Alright. I'm so screwed.

McCannon's fine. Meek is... silenced.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh hang on, hang on, hang on.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Oh no! The person who doesn't need verbal components to his abilities is so silent.

[Referee (Landie)]
You see the typewriter sitting on this bench over here. But a bunch of shadows are summoned as the silence washes over you as we have the last fight for.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
McCannon also must roll. He has walked away. A wheel!

[Machannan (James)]
A wheel suit.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh the spell cast is clutching up with this though. I believe on a success nothing happens. Silenced creature makes no sound and can't use the abilities with the sonic or auditory traits, including spells with verbal components.

That is a fail for McCannon. He cannot talk.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Spells don't have verbal components technically anymore.

[Referee (Landie)]
Concentrate spells. I think. Some do have a verbal component, I think.

I don't know if that's a thing in the remaster anymore, if it's part of the spellcasting.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, they got rid of it in the remaster.

[Referee (Landie)]
It might be in like spellcasting rules though. It's like a general thing now rather than...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I think it does because if it has like the subtle trait, then like... That's the only way it's not...

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I think sonic spells don't work, and spells that require conversation. So like if you try to demoralize someone with like verbal chat, things like that, that all gets nullified.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Or you suffer the penalties from it, so I think it's like minus four.

[Referee (Landie)]
It doesn't matter anyway. Spellcasters are fine. Alright, we have another initiative.

[Machannan (James)]
I better roll good on my fucking pursuing. Oh boy.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
It's like a nat 1 roll for initiative. I'm on fire. I'm on point, and it's slowest person.

I feel gifted.

[Referee (Landie)]
This might be the end of poor meek. Meek shall protect me. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

I just need mekana and an initiative. You did a perception check again.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, I did. I did. That's embarrassing.

Hold on. Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You did another perception check. Jamie, so when you go into the encounter tracker, there's a button... you did another perception check.

If you go into the encounters, there's a thing that lets you...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, stop touching the button. Stop clicking it.

[Referee (Landie)]
Rewarded for your action. You still don't get to go first though. The greater shadow gets to go first.

Sorry, the greater redacted. These aren't just shadows, I swear. How do I not target you all with this attack?

Alright. Yeah, this is really bad for meek. I can't see any world where it doesn't stride up to and hit you twice.

Or hit you once at least.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I shouldn't have been in front. Yeah, you hit me once.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
I'm down. If you roll 20 above it, does that count as a super crit?

[Referee (Landie)]
I wish. You can get double double damage. Hey, meek saved you.

He has to do another action to get to you guys. I know, he tries stealing your shadow. Pulls out your shadow, making the creature enfeebled 2.

Enfeebled 3 on a critical hit.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Oh, please maybe have Roll of Forge save, I'm better at those.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, no, save it just does it. It's got like, uh... If this and creatures are creatures enfeebled to value 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body.

See shadow spawn. That makes another redacted of meek. Uh, that is its turn.

I need to roll that's initiative. We'll go next round. Yay, I'm helping, I'm a speed bump.

You should not have Courageous Anthem currently. Does anyone have duration effects that will get broken by one minute passing? That didn't break, I think that's good.

Alright, Ver, what you got for us?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Fireball!

[Referee (Landie)]
Beautiful.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Oops, I think I'm out of art.

[Referee (Landie)]
Just a heads up, they're all currently in shadow. You could have cast Light before doing that, would you like to?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Would the Light not eliminate them?

[Referee (Landie)]
The Light of Fireball?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Yep.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, it would not.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
If I do Light, I can't Fireball them.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, can't you?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
No, that's a true action.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, that's... Halo's won, damn. Okay, no, okay, I'll do the saves.

You fuck up Meek's shadow with that, I think. Yeah, it hits it good. The rest are pretty resistant to it.

Jacob can finally eat Meek.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
It's like trying to eat a ghost pepper, trust me, it won't end well.

[Machannan (James)]
You don't have any taste buds anymore, it's fine.

[Referee (Landie)]
Meek's tone would have moved, sorry. Yep. My initiative improved!

Huzzah, death!

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Is there like a step option where I can swap faces with Meek?

[Referee (Landie)]
Not that I'm aware of.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Can I jump on top of Meek?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, you can stand over him, he's prone, currently.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Alright, I'll keep directions, and he'll go up, and...

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Oh, finally applied the death thing.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, I did that. It's like there's hell of a delay.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
You do me for that, and that'll be my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, we move to Meek's shadow, which isn't acting this round. McCannon.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, uh, so I'm like just totally silenced, right?

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, you... Yes. You cannot talk.

You don't make sound either. No bonbo.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, let's get shooting.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Oh, double digits!

[Machannan (James)]
That's gonna be an exploration. Uh, it took off my... where's my pursue a lead?

Anyways, I mark him as off guard to Mimosa. And then I miss. And then I miss again.

I'm gonna renew my pursue a lead, I don't know why that disappeared. I need that to be a soundbite.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
How long is too long for a soundbite? Five hours?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Over five seconds.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
That's close on the number.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I can't just put the entire shot and missed game grumps clip. You can do it once.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
And then after that, it's annoying.

[Machannan (James)]
That's McCannon, that's McCannon.

[Referee (Landie)]
We move to Kamon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hello, friends and enemies. You know what's coming next. I believe in you.

Thank you. Will lingering composition stick? Find out next time.

[Referee (Landie)]
James' world will see you don't get to... Nevermind, it's tied!

[Kamon (Heart)]
The handshake! Alright. Uh, after that...

At two... is McCannon still silenced?

[Machannan (James)]
Yes. I don't know how to get rid of him.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, cool. Would using this take an action?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yep, but you can apply that to McCannon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Cool, I will do that.

[Referee (Landie)]
McCannon is no longer silenced.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, and with an action... We... what can we do?

We can use our elbow. Sorry about your shadow, dude, it's going to die. No, my precious child!

No damage, it'll live.

[Referee (Landie)]
Makes no damage.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And that's my turn. Salute. That's the end of my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
I got my shadows confused, hang on. Meek's shadow is moving to initiative now. Sorry, initiative four.

And... It's this shadow's turn. It is going to go for Jacob, I suppose.

I'm just going to move Meek down so I can target the skeleton. It spends an action flying in. It's currently where Meek's token is.

I'm not going to stack them because that'll just be a pain in my ass. And it's going to take two... Uh...

Needs to be a living creature to steal their shadow. Jacob is immune to it. Does Jacob take void damage?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
He could. Probably not. Because that was an issue I ran into with abomination vaults.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Jacob takes no damage. Yeah, no, he just attacks again.

And it doesn't matter if it hits because Jacob's unaffected.

[Machannan (James)]
Jacob!

[Referee (Landie)]
Jacob, my goat. Um... I've moved Meek back.

I'll move the shadow to where it is.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh... I'm so glad I had Meek targeted still.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's now Para's turn. Set as current combatant.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, I will... Um... Pop up my halo.

Doom condition would have reset by now, right?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, you'd be fine. If you turned it off. If you didn't, you'd be dead, so...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, it hits the 3 near the doll.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh shit, I untargeted. Nope. Meek is still targeted, good.

[Referee (Landie)]
Um...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um... And then I will...

[Referee (Landie)]
Fess.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Um...

[Referee (Landie)]
Fess. Fess. They're all stunned 1.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I will heal Meek. It is a little bit of overkill, but I have no other option. It's either level 1 or it's level 3.

[Referee (Landie)]
Very good. So Meek goes to a wounded one.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
What happened? Why am I on my back? Why am I looking at someone's crotch?

[Referee (Landie)]
We apply that to Meek. Yes. We can...

Remove dying. And add wounded. That is all of Para's actions.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Yeah, the apply healing will blur it out for me.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yep, I already applied it to you. Oh, okay. You're all good.

Everything's applied as it should. Para's done, we move to Shadow. Which Shadow?

This one, the one that got fireballed. Am I okay to delete the fireball template? Yep.

Thank you. They all got fireballed. They did.

Well... It's not going to attack the skeleton, so it might as well hit Meek. It's going to strike...

Sorry, fly, and then attack Meek. For 10 damage. And, uh, steal your Shadow.

Which is now maxed out at Enfeebled 4. Enfeebled 7, that was unintentional, hang on. Uh...

God, it turned up the gravity. Things got so heavy. There you go.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Just turn to Jelly.

[Referee (Landie)]
Ah, that's a turn. Mimosa.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That's tough, you have to tumble through to get in there, I think.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh no, you can walk through them, they're incorporeal. I assume that's how that works. Any ghost-touch weapons you have get stuck.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I see you're also muted.

[Referee (Landie)]
These things are muted off-guard, they are not.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, that was still one turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... You're going to tumble through? Oh no, you can step through, you can step around.

Or is it... I have...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Do I need to tumble through? You said that if you're incorporeal I can just step through.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, no, no, you can step sort of on the desk. Oh no, right, they incor... Yeah, no.

Nevermind, I'm griefing myself.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, I'm just gonna go. Yes, please. Holy shit.

[Referee (Landie)]
Kill on this guy. Oh, Meek's shadow. It's gone.

Meek's shadow's dead.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, was that bad?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
My precious shadow. Peter Pan's gonna be pissed.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Um, and then... One more hit. Ah.

Okay, good.

[Referee (Landie)]
Meek, it's your turn. You're currently prone. I will stand up.

Okay. Do they have reactive strike? They do not.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Right, you're already...

[Kamon (Heart)]
QTFO. The only one I can see.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I will try to blast with vitality. Oop, that should be a one action.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, it should be not resistant to this at all. Correct, very good. Ah, that's your last action, we move back to the greater shadow.

Sorry, redacted. He is stunned one, he loses an action. And this is looking awfully alive and hit-able.

Spends an action attacking you. So close. With his next action, he steals your shadow.

He pulls out your shadow, making you infeable too. That is his turn. We move to the...

[Verr (Verheehee)]
If I summon a flaming skull, would that count as light source?

[Referee (Landie)]
Does it shed magical light?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
It sheds light and is magical. I'm going to cast Slow on the big guy. Can I please have a foot save?

[Referee (Landie)]
He gets a success, he is slowed for one round.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Okay. If I'm strong and table doesn't attack carry weight, I'd be screwed. My backpack would be an anchor.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
And then Jacob is going to do a strike. And egg.

[Referee (Landie)]
Cannon!

[Machannan (James)]
Yes!

[Referee (Landie)]
Holy shit. Well done. You should target the one that's in the magical light.

[Machannan (James)]
Oh, okay. We'll shoot that next one. I'm going to make this one...

Yeah, Paragose. I'm going to make this one off-guard to Mimosa.

[Referee (Landie)]
Do you mind shooting the one in the magical light? I think you would've. Surely.

[Machannan (James)]
Sure.

[Referee (Landie)]
Good. Good. Because otherwise...

[Machannan (James)]
Otherwise they're immune to...

[Referee (Landie)]
Otherwise they're immune to your precision damage.

[Machannan (James)]
Which is... Good point. I didn't get that...

Did I get that undead one? Yeah. I had to double check.

I had to redo my feats, because my feats were off-guard.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm going to let you attack the one that isn't going to block most of your damage.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, no, I appreciate that. I thought that one was also in the light. For some reason.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, he's avoided it.

[Machannan (James)]
Alright, yeah, so if I hit this guy with the 20... Yep. Yes, that is my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, we move to Khamon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hello.

[Referee (Landie)]
Hello.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's going to pop right back up in a couple of seconds. But... As I can't really see anything, I'm afraid I might have to start...

Oh! Start moving, especially because it seems that... Our good friend didn't get it.

So, going to move right over here. Yeah, right over here. Okay.

Let me check if I can move that far one sec. I cannot.

[Referee (Landie)]
Well, let me see. You got 25 speed?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, no, that's good.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. So, we are going to... So, that is one action.

We have two left. I really want to try this spell since I haven't gotten to it yet. Noise blast!

Oh, 10 feet, the burst is pretty big. Alright, I'm going to lower it down here. Please roll a fortitude save.

Okay. Let me target, hold on. Oops, that's the wrong button.

[Referee (Landie)]
I've got it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
There we go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Two successes, they both take health. They are in magical light, they don't resist it. And we take 7 damage each.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Joy is dead. And my turn.

[Referee (Landie)]
This shadow is stunned 1, loses an action. It's going to take a swing at my cannon through the door. No longer going for Jacob.

Miss. One more. Hit.

Hitting the cannon for 12 damage. We move to our holy light, Para. Do you sustain your light spell?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Okay, they get to roll their saves again. They ended their turns in your thing, so their saves get 1 worse. Fail.

Crit fail. Crit fail. Crit fail on the big guy is huge.

Well done. Not that you did much, I guess. What would you like to do for your turn?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm going to target the big guy with a moonlight ray.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, whoops, he isn't in the light. It's just the... Ignore the other shadow that got stunned 1.

Uh, yep.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Well done.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Very hurt by that. Let's see. And then I have 25 feet, so if I...

[Machannan (James)]
Let's see, that's where a cannon is, isn't it? I'll be right back, I'm going to grab some clothing from down the street.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No worries. Oops. Oh, oh, where am I going?

Hello. There's 5... 10...

Okay, I'm going to go here. I think that is...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, good.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Great.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, maybe you've done an extra diagonal.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Have I?

[Referee (Landie)]
No, you're good. Unless your speed's like 20.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's 25, thankfully.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, good. Oh, yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, now I'm in here, now he has to make a save. Um... Or is it Winona's turn?

[Referee (Landie)]
Make a save. No, I think I've been doing today when you cast it. So, the save is for the stunned, but now that he is in the light, he has his resistance negated.

That's what I've been doing. So it is his turn. He's coming.

He's going to fly towards you. Hits you. Oh, no way!

I rolled three ones.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So he is dead. I rolled an I would do, that sucks.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, so I can take reactions as in people?

[Referee (Landie)]
People just minuses to your strength checks. I came with Jacob, very nice. Oh, so close to the crit.

Uh... Hooking him. I love precision damage.

No way.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Is he like worn away?

[Referee (Landie)]
He survives on the brink as well, both of the greater shadows. He doesn't get a turn. So...

That was Mimosa's last action, meek. What you got for us, buddy?

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Let's see. What miracle can I do? I only have one in view unless I move.

[Referee (Landie)]
I do have a 30-foot cone, but I might hit some allies. Uh... Yeah, it's just going to nick everyone.

Thanks for healing me and bringing back to life.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Collateral damage! No, I wouldn't.

[Referee (Landie)]
They both really hurt. Take your pick of who you want to try and... If you do two attacks, you might get them both.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
You have to go after the big one and want to conk him in the first place. That's true.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, it's a mean one.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I'll do a regular one action and fight Parley's last.

[Referee (Landie)]
Nice! Parley makes just the king of punching above his weight. He killed it!

Good job! Skadoosh.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
See if I can nail the other one.

[Referee (Landie)]
Big burst of fire, you killed them both. Well done. It's my life force, how's it taste?

Hey. We move to Vur. One left.

What you got for us? Yep.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Deku's going to try to do a little fight.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's in the magic collect. Takes the full. Yep.

And it'll do the map. Holy shit. These are the Vur summons we missed.

How do you want to do it?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Deku just starts eating it. Starts plouring into it. Just shoveling stuff inside of him.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Eugh. Good boy! Through the mouth or through the ribcage goes now?

Both.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
You notice his shadow expands as he consumes more and more.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
You can't taste it if you shove it into a ribcage. It's the mouth, buddy.

[Referee (Landie)]
Cleaning out... Oh, hang on, I'll give you XP first. Uh, again, level 4s would be Mechanon and Meek.

Level 4s and lowers, that would be Clapton Meek. And an extra 30 XP in for the trap. Uh, double to 286 XP for Mechanon and Meek.

Big encounter. Well done. I don't think I applied that automatically again.

Do you clean out Julia's room? Money. Yep.

[Kamon (Heart)]
400 gold.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Have we found her? Like, I wouldn't want to touch the room until we found her. But we've also been taking 400 gold.

Okay, if she's not dead and unable to come back... Yeah. We'll leave the room until we know what happened to her.

And if she's, like, dead dead, then we'll take her stuff.

[Referee (Landie)]
Now have the typewriter, it was sitting on a table here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
What did Meek already pocket? I was making a joke, he didn't do anything, but... I'd like to think as you were...

As you were explaining that Meek had just gone and I was like, ooh, gold.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
A lot of gold.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, we have the typewriter.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Also, are these guys still enfeebled? Yep. Will the cleanse thing help them?

[Referee (Landie)]
Halo ends. The mention of the typewriter and the stones being reunited is 50.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, oops. Will the power cleanse still work or did it get used up?

[Referee (Landie)]
It got consumed when you used it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Eh, alright. Let me delete it from my inventory then.

[Referee (Landie)]
They're all one-time use items. Okay. What's the power?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm afraid it might be disabled. Darling. Alright, I'll pick...

What were you saying about the typewriter landing?

[Referee (Landie)]
The mention of the typewriter and the stones was on page 50 of the manuscript.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alrighty. I mean, do we want to reunite them or do we want to explore? Explore.

But are we stopping for the day or are we continuing on?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I feel like we're really close to the end. Okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Let's reunite the stones then. We could explore the top floor a little bit more first since we explored all of downstairs. I guess she might let us explore if we finish everything anyway.

And we might find what we need to revive after. Are we going to wait for James to be back?

[Referee (Landie)]
I don't think so. James needs to get going soon so I think we just push on.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okie dokie.

[Referee (Landie)]
Upstairs.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh wait, there's two doors down here. First we should explore. And the typewriter's just right here.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'll take the typewriter with you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
Who wants to take the typewriter? I'll stick it in the inventory.

[Kamon (Heart)]
He'll take it. Unless someone else wishes to. He can take it for now.

Okay. I take the typewriter. And then, door opening time!

[Referee (Landie)]
You search these rooms, it's just her closet and her personal bathroom and stuff. Nothing too crazy up here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Clothes.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Anything my size in here?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm afraid not.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Don't have kids.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Do we want to quickly heal up before we go on? That would be wise. That would be wise.

Virg, could you please have your skeleton go somewhere that he's not going to get hit?

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Ah, I see how it is.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'd rather not kill him.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
He'll go away that side of the door.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I do need my cannon in here though. So he can get some healing. Alright, gonna do the full 30 foot.

I will assume everyone gets within 30 feet of Virg.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I still have most of my blood in me. There's some there, some over there, some on the ceiling. How'd I get there?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I didn't lose blood, I know where it is.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
How do you determine if you have to cast cleanse or do something?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think it depends on what gives it to you.

[Referee (Landie)]
Yeah, this one has a specific condition that will end it. You can do a medicine check or recall knowledge sort of thing if you want to figure it out.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, I can do that. Darling, thank you.

[Referee (Landie)]
I know what to do, I have this axe. Meek, you are an expert in the subject matter as you do not have a shadow, but you don't know what will fix it. Hera, you can see Meek's shadow is coming back slowly.

Do you think it just needs time? And being in sunlight would help.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, we're stuck in darkness, so...

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
So, I need needle and thread to get it back on, don't I?

[Referee (Landie)]
Sitting in the manuscript is a blank page. Sorry, not the manuscript, in the typewriter is a blank page. There are bits of page around similar to what you've been picking up, but these ones are all blank.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I wonder if we typed something, it would come true. Does anyone wish to test that out? Alright.

Go ahead.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
It's not a cold-balled typewriter.

[Referee (Landie)]
It doesn't scream when you use it. Well, let me see if you find an actual piece of the manuscript.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, you just have the guidelines for using it on page 50.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Who has page 50? Let me check if I do, but I don't think I have page 50. It's not me.

Nope, 93320.

[Referee (Landie)]
Have I not given you 50?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm not griefing you.

[Referee (Landie)]
I made 50. If you don't have page 50 yet, then it's in this room.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright, everybody. Nose to the floor, sniff it out.

[Referee (Landie)]
Can I test it out? I'm better at that. Have I made page 50?

Oh, yeah, I've never made it, my bad. Sitting on the page wasn't with the typewriter, it was on her bed or something. No wonder this doesn't make sense.

You don't have the entire plot.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
52 does say, like, the Ever After Stones and the typewriter were reunited. Finally, the heroes could move beyond the basement to their destination. They needed to be careful.

The reality they create must have balance. There cannot be triumph without hindrance. But the darkness was close.

It would stop at nothing to achieve its goals. So, we have to overcome something? But we have to make sure we write the thing to overcome.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Para illuminated the darkness with her light. Cleansing the area. Illuminating the riches of the mansion.

Ready for the adventurer's reward.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It sounds like for every good thing, we have to add a bad thing. And it has to be an equal bad thing. She's probably gonna get the curse again, or something like that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And if you have a large treasure hoard, that probably means there's a large treasure guardian.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
And McKenna dies in the process.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh no. I think you should sacrifice your own character if you're gonna make a threat like that.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Jacob dies in the process.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Does that work?

[Referee (Landie)]
Do you type that in?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sorry, what's being typed in now?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm testing. I'm testing to see if it works. Do I get hurt?

[Referee (Landie)]
Is that why you make page 53?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, I guess... Do we only have one page? And is it only one sentence?

Do you only get one shot?

[Referee (Landie)]
A page can be whatever you want. You need to write whatever's being put on the page in chat.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I also feel like whatever we write is gonna be it. I don't think we get multiple shots, because I think we have to complete the page for it to happen. Oh, okay.

I don't think we get to try these out.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, so we can write about binding the author and using the title page, Revival, we get her back. Since it's a Word of Power, if you think about it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think we should explore more before we make a decision.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, okay. That's fine.

[Referee (Landie)]
Um... You can explore the top floor. There's a few tripwires, but even if you set them off, it doesn't really mean anything.

If you search all the rooms, you'll find some money and the key for the room downstairs that you... ...struggled with. So you can add another 200 gold to the party stash.

There are more Words of Power. They're more of the ones that you already have. There's nothing else on the top floor, though.

Feel free to wander.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. So, if there's nothing more, I suppose then we should get to the typewriter and...

[Referee (Landie)]
If you spend time searching the house, the only place you haven't explored that is unavailable is where you need to go. In the basement, beyond the locked vault door.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, we should have the door unlocked for sure. Honestly, just making it take as long as that last door did would be definitely...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
This thing goes on forever, oh my god.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Even this door?

[Referee (Landie)]
There, though, you find the rickety stairs that lead up. And Mamosa finds the corner stairs that lead up and the outside stairs that lead up over here.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I find everything! Should I just make the entire map visible?

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm gonna make the whole map visible, I think.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I think I'm done, I think I got...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's very funny seeing everyone running around through the windows.

[Referee (Landie)]
Were you able to see everything, or did I fuck up?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, I could see. I just can't. Thank you, Otter.

[Referee (Landie)]
But we'll get a little bit brighter. Now I'm dragging Mamosa through the walls.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
If I drag somewhere, it'll automatically do my pathing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You probably have the pathfinding on.

[Referee (Landie)]
So this brings me back to the question, what do you write on the manuscript?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm thinking... I'm trying to make sure...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Don't try and trick the manuscript into giving us a negative. Because I know that's always been a problem whenever we encounter something that's like... A good and a bad.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm gonna take us back to the basement, because that's where you need to go.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
What could be more horrible than... Jacob... Going out in a blaze of glory.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Where was the bomb?

[Referee (Landie)]
Over here. I don't know if you can see the three doors, but they're all locked.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Are they secret?

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, they're secret. That's funny. It's like a vault door, but it almost seems like it's part of the wall rather than a door.

I know typically vault doors are like that, but this almost seems like a prop. It's not real.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
It kind of looks like that does.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So does anyone have any ideas?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm trying to think.

[Machannan (James)]
I'm getting ready to leave soon, but what's going on right now? We're in the final push.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
We have to write something very kind of specific on the paper. Describe it to me.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It has to be... Mimosa, can you put 52 in the chat again? Yeah.

I don't want to have to go hunting it down again. How long can a page be?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Important question. I have written a song and I realized I might have written too much.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, the pages can be a lot longer than what I've written. The pages I've written are typically less than a third of the page that you've found. There's a lot of room for edits and things on this draft.

[Machannan (James)]
Let's talk about trapping the darkness.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It says there cannot be triumph without hindrance, so it has to have balance.

[Machannan (James)]
Let's trap the darkness in a sword. Or gun. I'd like to keep this darkness close at hand, but I'm not really comfortable with it running out into the world.

Besides, I think I might be able to use it for something. We gotta do a little experiment down at the skeleton cave.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Got this cave.

[Machannan (James)]
I think the safest thing would be to stuff it inside this nice gun. Gives me the freedom to track down where it came from, I wish. Any objections?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Let's see what Kamon has cooking first. I'm not cooking.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I am being chopped.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Is that chopping?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Do you want to send what you have so far so we can look at it?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sure, why not. Alright, cool. Give me more disadvantages to put into this, because the servants staying dead, us being attacked seems like an okay enough, and being hit by silence again seems like a good enough disadvantage.

But maybe more?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Could we also use all the past trials we've had to balance out what we're getting? Sure. Because someone almost died, a couple people have almost gone down, we've been enfeebled.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I don't know if I would call it impenetrable. Alright, give me a better word to use. I'm sorry, it was a 10 minute markup.

If you do have edits, please feel free to add them, and or write them in voiceover flow. So, change the wording of the gate, add more of the trials. Which other trials should I add to the thing?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Um, I mean, it doesn't seem that bad? Do we need more?

[Kamon (Heart)]
It just has to be balanced. So, silenced and shadow attacked is good enough, or should there be more negatives? Oh, and Julia not being too happy with us technically robbing her.

That was the other disadvantage at the end there.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
This is my shithead parade.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm okay for that, yes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
With my cannons?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You're alright.

[Kamon (Heart)]
How would we get Julia back that we might need to add? Well, adding it into yours, like combining them.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Would you like a PS after the party makes haste?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright. Party makes haste.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It does seem very funny, the party makes haste right after that.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Makes it sound like we're just like, okay, bye, goodbye, we're never talking to you again, goodbye.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's good to know I imagined it, alright.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I mean, you don't have to do a PS, but that one was more of a joke.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Don't worry, don't worry, um... The darkness retreated, here we go. Darkness retreated.

However...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Are you unhappy, Landy? Uh, Landy, would you like someone to make a check to maybe figure out if we're on the right track or not?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Here we go. That's the, with the added cannon bit.

[Referee (Landie)]
Basically I have a good enough check, uh, threshold, and I think that one passes it. Due to the restraints of the story, uh, obviously... Well, you'll find out soon.

Do you collect the stones together?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah, like two halves of a coconut. Mm-hmm.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh... Uh, you open the... Uh, the...

How do I open this? Do that? It opens, revealing a corpse behind the door.

The vault, uh, slowly opens itself. Uh, behind you, more of the shadows surround you. They are unable to withstand the might of the Everafter Stones, and they're banished.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Three chairs.

[Referee (Landie)]
Down the, uh, past the corpse, you see, is the elevator that is outside that you have not been through yet.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Right, then folks, there we go.

[Referee (Landie)]
Do you go up the elevator?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Referee (Landie)]
The elevator takes longer than expected to go up a single floor, and you end up at a weird stop, uh, outside a room with a spiral symbol on the door, similar to what is on the stones.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
How are you going to hold them up to it?

[Referee (Landie)]
Nothing happens.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So I repeat what they show us?

[Referee (Landie)]
The elevator has stopped in some sort of interdimensional space where you are now in front of a door in a small room, rather than a, uh, up at the, uh, up at the pool.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh no.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, you're in front of a door with the spiral symbol on it, similar to the stones that you have. The elevator can go up again if you would like.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Pyrah opening the door did, uh, nothing, right?

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh, does Pyrah try to open the door, sorry?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, yeah, that's what I was doing with the stones.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, the stones don't do anything.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Does it just open?

[Referee (Landie)]
The door is locked. Well, it's not locked, it's shut. It cannot be opened.

Do you hear as you, uh, fiddle with the door? No! Don't come in!

Stop! From behind the door.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Hello? We're here to help.

[Referee (Landie)]
Hello, yes, are you there? My name's Julia Dubois. Please, help me.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Uh, how do we help you without opening the door?

[Referee (Landie)]
Do not open the door. The darkness cannot escape.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh, sweetie. Do you know that the darkness has kind of escaped already? Your house is in darkness.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, that's part of the story. You need to make sure it doesn't escape.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh!

[Referee (Landie)]
I regained my sanity. You must have changed the story. Did you write an ending?

[Kamon (Heart)]
We did.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
We did, especially for the darkness.

[Referee (Landie)]
Does the darkness escape? Do not let it escape.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No, the darkness does not escape. The darkness does not escape. It is going to be...

Contained. Yeah, it's going to be contained.

[Machannan (James)]
What did we write? Contained? What do you mean?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
You get your wish, McKenna.

[Machannan (James)]
Yes. Julia, what we're saying is you have the opportunity to write a sequel.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
What we're saying is we have a way to trap the darkness.

[Referee (Landie)]
A sequel? Yes, that's a good idea. I'll write a sequel.

I'll write a new story. Yes.

[Machannan (James)]
This will surely have no negative consequences.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So how do we help you?

[Referee (Landie)]
No, this story is no good. It's no good. I didn't mean to involve you in this.

I'm sorry. The story needed heroes. I'll write a new story.

You'll be heroes again. The next one will work. Yes, I'm certain.

You've given me back my sanity by including my revival in your script. Thank you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You're most welcome. But we must... Go ahead.

[Referee (Landie)]
We cannot let the Ballad of Creation go ahead. I'll write a new script. I'll include you all in it to help me.

Yes.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
This... Oh, this was a ballad? You were trying to create a ballad?

[Referee (Landie)]
It's not me the darkness wants to write a ballad. It wants to escape. I won't let it.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
She's going to kind of cover her mouth because we just gave that to McCannon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
This is what we get for trusting.

[Machannan (James)]
The world's a darkness, Mackie.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Give her to us.

[Referee (Landie)]
You must keep the Everafter Stones safe. They're essential for making art become reality.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
There's plenty safe. There's plenty safe.

[Referee (Landie)]
If the darkness has the stones, it can create whatever it wants. It can control the story. It always wants a horror story.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's in safe hands.

[Machannan (James)]
Keep those far away from me and my... There's a nice gun here. That's not that nice.

It's tolerated. Oh, this gun's shot. Tolerated.

Warp grips has mildew. The trigger has not piloted protection. Good perfection.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright. We do need to go in to try and help you. We do need to go in and try and help you.

We'll keep the stones safe and we'll save you from the darkness that has, I guess, caged you, alright? And you'll be able to write as much as you like. You can make us heroes if you desire, but in order for you to write again, you need to get out, don't you?

[Referee (Landie)]
No, I can write. I have my typewriters here with me. I'll write a new book.

The darkness wants me to write. It wants me to write a story where it escapes. I won't let it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, just for clarification reasons, do we still have her typewriter?

[Referee (Landie)]
Yes, you do.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. Okay.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
What if we... Okay, but Melissa's gonna be like, okay, huddle. What if we change the words to say the darkness escaped into the gun and then could not get out?

Sure.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Does anyone have, like, a pen? Anybody got some whiteout? We can use a pen.

It should work. Just, like, scribble out the other words. But wait, didn't we say McKennan helps out his hand and basically eats the darkness?

[Referee (Landie)]
That is in the script.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, that is in the script.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Well, I mean, if we can't cage it, then it's fine. Yeah, we can do it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Caging it in McKenna.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
If it's so bent on escaping, we can let it escape into a new trap.

[Kamon (Heart)]
McKennan is the trap, I'm afraid. He wants... yeah.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's okay. It's all good.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, so no need to mess with whiteout.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Julia, can we tell you what we wrote? Will that help? If we say it out...

well, it's already happened, never mind.

[Referee (Landie)]
The script that you wrote is what I've written. You're following the actions I set for you in the script. I left the manuscript for you to guide you.

It's already done.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, so then you know what our plan is, then, with our friend McKennan.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hello!

[Referee (Landie)]
I will make sure I will fix it in a sequel, yes. You must leave now. The veil, you have thwarted it.

Well done. I will contact you again.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Okay, well, good luck. Good luck.

[Machannan (James)]
It was a good plan, but...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Wait, you're just gonna stay there in that vault with the darkness?

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, that's the idea. I can't escape yet.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's not ready. The story must be perfect so the darkness doesn't escape.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, I guess I'm just confused. Okay. Okay, huddle time.

Because we still have her typewriter and this is an interdimensional space, I imagine that the Julia here is a little different from the Julia we're going to see behind the actual vault that we're going to right now.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
Well, you found her corpse. In very, very hushed terms.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We did find her corpse.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
In very hushed terms, yeah. I'm sorry. Maybe that is the darkness and it's trying to get us to free her themselves.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, we could find out by keeping the typewriter with us. Keep a load of paper in and see if Julia contacts us that way.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No, wait, guys, we wrote the ending, which was, we get to the vault, right? We get to the vault, we open the door, we see the bones. Landi, you said we see the bones?

Yep. We see the bones. Now we are supposed to be attacked by the remaining shadows of our servants and we're getting silence attacked again.

We were already attacked.

[Referee (Landie)]
I glossed over it quickly. The Everafter Stones repelled them.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, right. Okay, so that's happened. Now we just need to speak the title word.

So, as a group, all together now. Everybody speak to Landi. Ready?

No, it's for Michael. Not today. A different story, man.

Okay, so, the party, all together now, say Revival.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
Revival.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Cool. Revival, yes, we all say it together. Awesome.

Julia, how is Bones Julia doing? McKenna, hold out your hand. Oh, sorry.

Hold out your hand for the darkness. You're currently not near the bones.

[Referee (Landie)]
You went up the elevator a little bit to where Julia's new writing room is. You could go back down the elevator if you wish. Or you could go up.

[Machannan (James)]
I want to go up. I don't want to be trapped here anymore. Let's take a gun.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Wait, sorry. So, we're in front of her bones? We said the words.

[Referee (Landie)]
No, you're not in front of her bones. Do you wish to go in front of her bones? You're currently at the door to the writing room that she's currently in that has the spiral.

It is up the elevator in an interdimensional space. Would you like to go back down the elevator to the basement or up to the pool?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think everything that was in what you wrote is done. All done. I think this is the real one, and I think she just wants us to leave and she'll contact us again once she has a sequel.

Okay. I don't think there's anything else we can do here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
My cannon's supposed to eat darkness, but I guess that's not happening, so. Alright, well. Sorry about the darkness.

I'm so confused. Sorry, you wanted to absorb the darkness to carry the burden until it can be destroyed. And you're supposed to, like, hold out your hand.

Yes, yes. And leap into your embrace and then it, you know, gets absorbed into wherever. Yeah, I hold the gun.

Yeah, okay. And leaps into his gun. Sure, that's what we're searching.

What did you write? So. You say leaps into his gun?

I misheard you. Don't worry about it. No, your gun!

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No, no, it says your gun.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Don't worry about it. It says your gun.

[Machannan (James)]
Okay, so what are we doing here right now? Like, what's our concern?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, I don't actually.

[Referee (Landie)]
Julia calls out to her. You need to leave before the darkness. That makes you insane.

[Machannan (James)]
Sounds good, Julia!

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, cool, we leave. We're halfway there already.

[Machannan (James)]
Press the up button.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I think we just leave.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, let's leave.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright.

[Machannan (James)]
I press it.

[Referee (Landie)]
Alright, uh. You go up to the maintenance shed that was on the, out near the pool. There's a manuscript page on the ground in the shed.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Alright, well.

[Referee (Landie)]
Who's picking it up?

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Not me. Thank you. Thank you.

You're welcome.

[Referee (Landie)]
You open the door and the sun shines down onto you. An elven woman is standing about outside of the shed. As you all move out.

Uh, hello. Uh, hi. Thank you for dealing with the darkness problem of my manor.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Uh. You're most welcome, Julia.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes? Okay. It's good to see that you're alright.

Now that our job is done here, we will leave. We can always check in on you again. If you wish, to make sure that you're still alright.

Or, you could move in with any friends that you may have. So you're not left in the manor alone.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, I'll be okay by myself.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Um. Real quick.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
There's something in your vault that was talking to us. That said it was you.

[Referee (Landie)]
What vault? Hm.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, everyone.

[Machannan (James)]
Nevermind. Hello, Julia.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah! Just, in the moment she said that, Caman would be like, alright, everyone. And like, start herding them away.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
It's time to hit the dust. Julia said like, it was so nice to meet you. Your writing is lovely.

I'm the most Amerigold and I list my chart or whatever, I don't know. You can reach out to me anytime you would like. Have a good day!

And I think she'll- Okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And since you live in Brom- In the outskirts of Bronloch, you can always try and talk to me. I'm always around. My council business doesn't take up that much of my time.

[Referee (Landie)]
Uh. I feel this is a bit much for fixing my elevator, but thank you. Um.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hm.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Oh dear. Um. What- Okay.

It seems there's a bit of a mix-up. What day is it for you?

[Referee (Landie)]
I think it was...

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Forgotten.

[Referee (Landie)]
It's the... The 9th? The 8th today?

Whatever time zone we're in?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Um. Is that correct? Oh, right.

Or is that like- That is the correct day. Okay. Because we took a week- If it was still the 2nd or 1st or whatever for her, that would be concerning.

Yeah, so it's the correct day.

[Machannan (James)]
Uh. Uh. Anyways, Miss Julia.

Welcome for, uh. Jobbing the elevator. Tell you what, though.

Mm-hmm? Let us know if you see anything around here. I've been doing a lot of investigations in town.

Let me know if you hear anything from, uh, Manny Kane. You know. If you see anything funny about a murder, let me know.

[Referee (Landie)]
Oh, I'd love- Yes, that interests me greatly. I'd like to write a new mystery.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh. Okay. Thank you, McCannon.

[Machannan (James)]
Bye-bye! Hmm.

[Referee (Landie)]
That's interesting. Sure. And, uh.

Out of character, sorry, Otter. I added text to the page I put in your inventory.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh. I forgot that we had one.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Off we go.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It was- The darkness had been thwarted for a while now, and the veil lifts from the manor. But it would not lay in wait for long. The Ballad of Creation must continue.

The writer is still trapped. They cannot escape without releasing the darkness. They begin writing a new story to try and escape again.

Next time, the heroes would be ready. McCannon feels an evil stir within him. The heroes leave the elevator and the maintenance.

Julia Dubois greets them with a warm smile.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, isn't that fun.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Alright, everyone.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Off we go. No, it says gun. It definitely says gun now.

It says gun now. For sure. For sure.

Alright, let's go. It says gun.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, the thing about being in the gun is that it can still control the man holding the gun.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, cursed weapons, you know? Alright, off we go.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well done, everyone.

[Referee (Landie)]
You get 100 XP. Thanks. You get paid 20 gold from her publisher.

20 gold each for solving this.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, yay.

[Referee (Landie)]
They don't seem to know what you're talking about. Have you mentioned, like, darkness or anything like that?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh. Right, cool. Splitting the gold between everyone.

Are we selling? Okay, so you know how we said the jewelry thing? Is that selling as is?

[Referee (Landie)]
Jewelry, full value. You can just turn the jewelry to gold.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, let me just add that then. 250. Yes, delete.

Gold. Oops.

[Referee (Landie)]
Thank you for playing, everyone. I had a lot of fun running this for you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hell yeah, that was awesome.

[Machannan (James)]
Yeah, it was fun. How many people?

[Kamon (Heart)]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There's 6 people. 1030 divided by 6.

Okay. That rounds to 171 gold, 7 silver pieces.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Can you put that in chat so it's not just a scramble of numbers?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, sorry. 171 gold, 7 silver.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Angi.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I can afford an adamantine frying pan now. Yes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
If that is what your soul desires.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
It has great nonstick properties.

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right. Good night, everyone. It's early in the morning for me, and I am leaving now.

Bye.

[Referee (Landie)]
Bye bye.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sticky keys.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Sticky keys. I think that was her revenge for the brain scramble.

[Machannan (James)]
That was magnificent.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
That was great.

[Referee (Landie)]
Trying to look at how to change the mansion in the woods to being the Ballad of Creation. Edit thread. There we go.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Locannon is cursed. First place.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, and then once we go to Bronloch, we can just shop, right? Anything that's common is fair game.

[Referee (Landie)]
There's a chance you'll find uncommon stuff as well.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
100 away from level 6. You can see it would be really funny if we could find a typewriter.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I made level 3.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That means... Oh damn, that is a level 9 item. Damn it.

The printing press? No, the knapsack of halfling kind.

[Referee (Landie)]
I love the knapsack of halfling kind.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Mimosa needs it.

[Referee (Landie)]
She does.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It is 675 gold.

[Verr (Verheehee)]
The bag holding the spacious bags at the moment, if that's what you're asking.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was looking at spacious pouch, but I was also looking at the knapsack of halfling kind specifically.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I'm about 200 gold away from it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Spacious pouch is common.

[Referee (Landie)]
You can even buy common recipes. Yeah, up to 7th level.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I can only get up to 3 right now.

[Referee (Landie)]
If you, um... Once you learn uncommon and rare stuff, you need to talk to drug dealers and stuff in town. To have a learned rare recipe, I think.

[Meek (MrNybbs)]
I plan to take the inventor feat eventually, so I can just make them as I go. I just have to roll some insane checks to do it. It's all first cooking crap anyway, so it's not like I'm going to invent a bag of holding type 3.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Thank you for playing.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Thanks for having me. That was a fun session.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Makes a real venture now. He died once.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
I love the Twin Peaks feel at the end.

[Referee (Landie)]
I'm glad. We'll do more of this eventually when I write 30 more pages of... How many did I write?

I think you got all of them. One of them doesn't count because you got to write it. You got to write page 53.

[Machannan (James)]
Remember, you can legally steal from real life books and nobody can stop you.

[Referee (Landie)]
I wrote 15 of these.

[Machannan (James)]
Well, they were all solid, all awesome. Excellent work, and thank you for running. I have to go to work.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
Yeah, thank you.

[Mimosa (Nessie)]
No worries.

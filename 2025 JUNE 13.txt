[Speaker 6]
So I just read what the mission's gonna be and oopsies, uh-oh.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe we should just not come today. Yikes!

[Speaker 1]
Make it be sick, folks. Catch us through. Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

[Speaker 6]
It seems to be wanting Plink's soul, man. Hello!

[Speaker 1]
Where is Plink's bod?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I don't know. Uh, he was in one of the sessions that otter. If you mean his sheet, it's in my folder, but as for location, I don't think it was ever really given one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, just the, um, all right, so I think it's abandoned tavern right now. I'm not sure where it is right now in the maps.

[Speaker 3]
Um, it's Plink's bar.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, it is. This is what it says on the deed. I don't know ifâ€”uh, heart is supposed to be here, right?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Where is heart? but it's still the mission and request.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, isn't it?

[Speaker 3]
Just keep thinking about what his unfinished business would be. And he'd just be like, my business is never finished.

[Speaker 6]
Like I'm, I'm a business owner. What are you talking about? Do you ever meet Klinkbar?

[Speaker 4]
No, I haven't yet.

[Speaker 6]
He is a scrungly Tengu pro. Um, who's in his like 50s.

[Speaker 3]
He is of Oriental descent.

[Speaker 6]
And he owns a bar. He's a hoarder. Hello, I'm alive.

Hello. He usually takes like the more odd loot. And then he just hoards it.

He won't use it. It just goes in his bag. And he, uh, he was lunch to a manticore a little bit ago.

And he came back a ghost, but he will never admit he's a ghost.

[Speaker 3]
So if you ask what his unfinished business is, that's why he gives you the, I'm a businessman. Like my business is never finished. Like I'm busy.

I've got shit that I've always having to do.

[Speaker 4]
Klink is giving me, um, middle aged Italian American plumber vibes.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

[Speaker 5]
It's me.

[Speaker 3]
Just with the, um, have you seen how to Panda? He's a little bit more like the goose dad. Oh, I love the goose dads.

Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I thought you're going to say that he's looking for princesses in another castle.

[Speaker 3]
You wouldn't look for a princess unless the princess had some cool shit. I mean, princesses do typically have cool stuff.

[Speaker 5]
They're always decorated in the finest of shinies.

[Speaker 3]
Manaya likes those shinies. Klink wants that rusted piece of heirloom that nobody cares about.

[Speaker 6]
Or like five spoons and like a chipped teacup. I get that. More collector than a...

Yes, Richards. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Imagine that one show and they'll be like the bad person, like a collector of, um, memories. I mean, like he valued items that people cherished because they held memories. I'm trying to think of it now.

It was such a good one. But like a lot of the story was just, she was going grand collecting like a lot of benign items and people like, you know, what's wrong with you? Like, why is he getting all this gold and stuff?

And you're like, Oh, all the memories. And people are like, Oh, that's like an alien from like a family member that's no longer around. Things like that.

Does Googling that give you anything?

[Speaker 6]
Just like typing out a villain who collects memory items or something? Not really.

[Speaker 8]
Was it from a franchise?

[Speaker 5]
It was from a series, but it wasn't a very big one.

[Speaker 2]
And I'm guessing you don't remember the series either.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't remember what language was it in.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Fair enough.

[Speaker 5]
I want to say it wasn't French.

[Speaker 2]
Good enough.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Nessie, first off, I'd like you to give an update on Klinkz Bar and what it looks like and whatnot. And then I'm going to drop you people into the party.

So you drop yourselves into the party sheet, of course.

[Speaker 6]
I might add Rose if we don't have a healer. Klinkz Bar would probably look a lot the same. The pantry is probably a little bit more organized.

It's definitely more cleaned, more up to code. It's got a stock of all sorts of alcohols. Yeah, some of which are very expensive.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he's got 39 really expensive brandies.

[Speaker 6]
It would have music.

[Speaker 3]
By hiring a band.

[Speaker 2]
Magic jukebox.

[Speaker 1]
Stole a jukebox.

[Speaker 3]
Or, you know, maybe he's got haunted instruments. He's not picky. He tried to befriend a zombie once.

How did that go for him? His other friends killed the zombie because it's an abomination and he couldn't have it. And then they stole the cat that had resurrected the zombie.

So he lost two friends that day.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. All sorts are welcome there. Interestingly enough, it doesn't look like there's a lot of barf.

[Speaker 3]
But yeah, the tavern is what the map looks like.

[Speaker 6]
I wonder if my regular ghost...

[Speaker 3]
You wouldn't need to change it, because then you'd have to buy new furniture and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
But that's what... Okay, they changed the name.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, buddy.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. I need the rest of you guys to please add yourselves to the party sheet. So I can drop you all down.

[Speaker 6]
Of course.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have any healers in the party?

[Speaker 5]
That's what I was just waiting for to see what everyone else was doing.

[Speaker 3]
I'll bring Meryl. What is Meryl?

[Speaker 6]
Paladin.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so she does have decent healing?

[Speaker 6]
A little bit.

[Speaker 3]
A little bit? Okay, so do we want to bring another little bit healer so that we have full healing?

[Speaker 5]
I could bring my summoner, but I completely misunderstood the way you worked and I don't think it'll work.

[Speaker 3]
Summoners are not healers.

[Speaker 5]
But he has healing spells.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Summoners are technically melee with spells. And I don't know why they don't construct it for you having melee in mind, because they're charm-based.

But you need to up your constitution, because your summon's health is your health. So if it dies, you die.

[Speaker 2]
Dying the game. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I was going to say one, and I was thinking I could act together if I do two actions, if I get two actions for myself. So I'd be able to cast cantrip on both characters. Like, that'd be my turn.

But I realized it doesn't work like that. After I started, I was like, oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Currently I'm stuck between Minaya or the Doctor, because on one hand it's undead stuff, on the other hand it's clink. I know, yeah, Minaya is attached to clink. But if she steals this stuff, there will be problems.

She got cant stealing from a patron that one time, that's how I... And then she never did it again. Oh, so she doesn't steal anymore?

Not from your patrons, but from other people. Okay, good. No longer at the bar, but...

Other people, places, yeah. So anyway, who would be best for this?

[Speaker 5]
I was going to go Vera or Hooch. So Hooch came up with some alchemist.

[Speaker 6]
Do you have a healing recipe? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So yeah, Hooch can also help heal. I hate decisions.

[Speaker 5]
I prefer to play Vera.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, then I'm going to pop Rose in.

[Speaker 2]
I do have some alchemy bottles with the Doctors, so might bring him instead. Actually, you know what? Nessie, who would you prefer to see on this one?

[Speaker 6]
Okay. So what is Ver...? He's a wizard.

[Speaker 3]
Merrill is a paladin, so we've got a tank, which is good.

[Speaker 6]
We need another... melee-er tank.

[Speaker 2]
I have neither, unless you want me to throw my level 1 kata at you. Levent, in this case. So I don't think that you could...

[Speaker 5]
I have a level 1 fighter.

[Speaker 3]
We're going to need another melee, otherwise... All Bar's character will do is just go down. Because they will be the only frontliner.

And that sucks, and I don't want that for Bar. Yeah, level 1 is really rough, but if you're a level 1 tank and you are the only tank, so you're the only one soaking in it all, it's not going to be fun.

[Speaker 2]
I do not have any tanky characters, I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 5]
I'll bring my tank as well, if that's alright.

[Speaker 2]
Oh hey, there we go, your tank. Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Will you allow me to bring Rose, James? Or do we have too many characters?

[Speaker 1]
No, I think it's perfect, because Klink is going to have... No, I think it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Because they don't want us to die. Now, there will be a price with Rose, with healing her, but you can just feed her food.

[Speaker 5]
The price is frontlining?

[Speaker 3]
The price is food. It's not her fault you're dumb enough to be a frontliner.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I did the whole flip coin thing. We're taking the doctor since it's ghostly business, then.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Would you prefer Minaya?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, no, either one is fine.

[Speaker 2]
I can't decide, so I was going to throw the responsibility over to you.

[Speaker 3]
Minaya is fitting, but I don't feel like you've played Dr. Batya in a while. That's true. I feel like you've played Minaya more than the good doctor.

That's true.

[Speaker 6]
Is he a good doctor? The evil doctor? I mean...

[Speaker 2]
Okay. A doctor.

[Speaker 5]
If you have to question it, do you need to answer?

[Speaker 6]
The gray doctor.

[Speaker 8]
Sure.

[Speaker 6]
A morally gray doctor. Okay. Bar, have you heard of the show The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell?

No.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Rose is named after a character from there. She is terrible, horrible, loud.

And looks like a road kill. She kind of was one at one point. I sent you the video.

If we're still waiting to start. I made her in a quick panic because whatever session we were at we were all going to die. I made her really fast.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, we love her. Staple of the community.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, staple of the community like some of her fur is stapled back together.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, her introduction was also amazing. 10 out of 10.

[Speaker 6]
She's a tanuki. She was amazing.

[Speaker 8]
Thank you. This works.

[Speaker 2]
He turned on his camera so I thought.

[Speaker 1]
Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yes. I just had to adjust my camera.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Let me dump all of you folks over here.

[Speaker 4]
Interesting.

[Speaker 6]
Who is the nervous headed guy? Probably clink.

[Speaker 3]
Is he glowing blue?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you're right. I was seeing a jackal head rather than a bird head with a beak.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's all good.

[Speaker 2]
I was also seeing a jackal head. Don't forget to long rest your character. He looks like he got into a fight before he got here.

Ow. Whiskers. You have to long rest whiskers.

Ver is fine. Who is Mara? Is who?

[Speaker 5]
Mara? It might be best if you delete whiskers at the moment.

[Speaker 3]
Is it supposed to be Merrill but it just looks weird?

[Speaker 5]
No, no.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not crazy. Oh, Denton. He did change the token name.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think you're seeing what you think you're seeing.

[Speaker 5]
Un-fucking-believable. Where's Amara?

[Speaker 2]
It's your Denton. Oh, never mind. It seems I was also saying things.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's just changed.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's definitely been that way the whole time. Mixing up letters.

[Speaker 7]
Oh no!

[Speaker 6]
That's the GM too much.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are getting ready to close down for the day. Kling has been looking unwell as least as much as a spirit can. Just kind of like oddly twitching in places.

Kind of like sometimes that angle. Kind of, yeah. Like snapping her neck around to look at somebody in a way that obviously wouldn't work.

Yeah, getting pretty rough. Bye. At the end of the day you guys are giving the opportunity to kind of shuffle everybody out before so you can attend to Kling.

Once you do that...

[Speaker 3]
You have to pin him down. He is not going to stand still for you to look at him.

[Speaker 6]
But once you do...

[Speaker 1]
It's excluding Luke Cutlery from initiative. I don't know what that means.

[Speaker 2]
I think it was from the flying cutlery. So you might want... I think some of their stats might still be in.

So that's probably what you're saying by exclude cutlery from initiative. Some of whose stats?

[Speaker 3]
The cutlery from the inn was haunted. And we had to fight it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I thought you said lewd cutlery.

[Speaker 1]
That's a different establishment.

[Speaker 3]
I think we didn't have that. Rose owned an establishment, absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, alright, that's fair. I'm literally at this point just waiting for the rest of you to... Well, no, a bunch of you did roll initiative.

Well, you rolled perception checks, but did you...

[Speaker 7]
Oh, you were serious about the initiative? Oh, you're making a joke! Oh, sorry!

[Speaker 1]
There are a bunch of ghosts here.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I thought you were kidding.

[Speaker 5]
It's just easier to get into the swing of things.

[Speaker 4]
I was going to say I had a thing, but it's not the thing that I thought it was.

[Speaker 3]
If you need help, Barb, just let us know.

[Speaker 4]
No, I thought Champion's Aura would either help you guys out or alert possibly the ghosts or link to my being a paladin of the God of Death. But it's only followers of my deity within the aura.

[Speaker 3]
Also, Clink would not correlate that he needs to be annoyed or scared or mad at you or goose angry because he's not dead, so...

[Speaker 2]
So only followers of your deity benefit from the aura, or...? There is no benefit to it currently.

[Speaker 4]
They just know that I'm a champion of the Raven Queen when they're in my aura.

[Speaker 3]
I think he would think that's neat that there's a Raven Queen out there. But that would be the extent of his...

[Speaker 1]
Let us start off with the Wailing Ghost.

[Speaker 3]
Are we... Should we get into the formation first or are we just how you've dropped us?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. You guys are pretty optimally... You guys are in a great spot.

If you guys want to move around, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, were we taken by surprise? We can sit ourselves down on benches.

[Speaker 1]
Not quite. Things have been going wrong with Clink the whole day which is probably why Meryl's here.

[Speaker 3]
We're in combat, so this is where we're at.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so if you want to be moved to... Yeah, it's locked somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
I'd probably swap there with Denton. Who is Denton? Denton is my fighter.

[Speaker 2]
He got stuck in the labyrinth last time. Can you move Rose over here?

[Speaker 3]
She would not be this close to where everyone's taking care of Clink. There's no Clink or anything.

[Speaker 1]
Probably just move me back behind.

[Speaker 2]
Ah! Splendid. I'm just going to move myself behind Meryl.

Just a bit. There we go. So I'm not exactly in the line of fire.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. So the Wailing Ghosts go to spend one action to move up. There's a fighter incoming.

Load up. Act fighter. Pretty simple.

5 plus 9. Pretty critical. We'll attempt to demoralize you.

[Speaker 5]
I'm feeling pretty demoralized already. And then Denton's up. He's going to do a haunt attack as he thrashes his haunts raging around.

He's going to raise his shield. And I think that's as much as he can do. So he's just going to do a second attack.

Second hit. And that is his turn. Damage is damage.

Now to... Now it's Fehr's turn. Fehr's going to do...

His undead. Pardon? I was thinking his undead.

So I'm going to do a slashing strike. It's not your turn.

[Speaker 7]
What are you doing?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sorry. No worries.

[Speaker 1]
There's a dwarven looking spirit who's holding a magical dagger. This one's going to think. Before he moves he's going to do a chiding rebuke.

Misses. Do a second time. Also misses.

Okay, now, Fehr, you may go.

[Speaker 5]
Fehr's going to raise his hands and he's going to do a slashing gust. And dismiss. And second attack.

Hey, that's a hit. And he's going to command his hand to go over here. And attack that creature.

Also hit. And that is his turn. Does the slashing seem to have much effect?

As Fehr's hand starts to sneakily crouch behind and grab the ghost in the back.

[Speaker 1]
Did not take damage from me. Well, he took one. Wait, no, he took nothing from the claw.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 5]
So the attack speed had little effect?

[Speaker 1]
The slashing gust had little effect and the other one had pretty much... Yeah, your little claw guy didn't do anything. Which brings us to Riz.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, there's a ghost. I'll boo. Oh, I have our bombs.

I guess I'll try to stab someone with my sword. See if I get a second hit. Going back and that's my turn.

We need them a little bit more clumped together.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Welcome to the dogs. Two actions.

Wait, no, it's been one action.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no! Go away!

[Speaker 1]
No! It's going to moan frightfully.

[Speaker 3]
Like I haven't heard that before.

[Speaker 1]
Which is... Every creature within will be moaned. So I think that's...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's everyone.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Do we start out with two hero points or one?

[Speaker 1]
You'll start out with one hero point.

[Speaker 4]
I have two from my last session.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they restarted the game You don't love me.

[Speaker 5]
I'm sorry. So we all gonna roll? There you go.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to roll again.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl, this is old hat to Meryl. She is so used to this.

[Speaker 3]
So is Rose, but I think in a completely opposite way.

[Speaker 1]
There are Dr. Basha and Sokka.

[Speaker 2]
Sokka! It is Polish.

[Speaker 7]
Dr. Basha and Sokka, make your fucking thing.

[Speaker 1]
I don't even see Sokka on here. Yeah, you're all good. That brings us down to Cleek.

[Speaker 6]
Cool. Here we go. Yeah.

Do a pass.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no! I think we can do one more. For whatever it's worth.

Probably should have moved, but I forgot about that.

[Speaker 1]
There you go, Rebecca.

[Speaker 2]
Hello. Everything decided to crash very suddenly. I think I might have opened something.

[Speaker 1]
That's two actions? Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
The spell was two actions.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to the Spirit Hound. A different Spirit Hound. He's going to run up Rabbit first.

[Speaker 3]
I probably should have moved.

[Speaker 1]
Just barely hits.

[Speaker 7]
No!

[Speaker 1]
Does not. Oh, it's in Markman's Grafts. That's the end of it.

[Speaker 4]
Can I move over the bar?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, easily.

[Speaker 4]
And it's an action to raise my shield?

[Speaker 1]
To move your...

[Speaker 3]
Move your character right here. If you have the...

[Speaker 4]
I only have 20 feet of movement.

[Speaker 3]
You only have 20 feet? You should have 20.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know, maybe because of the armor.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, maybe.

[Speaker 5]
If you have low strength, it reduces by 5.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to ditch your backpack while you're in the thing, it's up to you.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to move yourself 5 feet down because you'd be able to ditch the rest of your inventory here.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
So, right there, I guess. No, because now it says I have more bulk than I did before.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just move your thing down.

[Speaker 3]
Did you...

[Speaker 4]
Did everything in your backpack fall out of your backpack? I clicked it and told it it was dropped.

[Speaker 1]
We don't have to actually remove the backpack right now? That's totally fine because we could just move you to the...

[Speaker 3]
Whatever.

[Speaker 1]
I could literally just move you right there.

[Speaker 3]
And then put all your stuff back in your backpack so you don't have all that extra bulk. And we'll just pretend you dropped the backpack.

[Speaker 4]
I said I dropped the backpack and everything didn't change.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, guys, stop talking about the backpack.

[Speaker 5]
Let the turn go. Let's just get the backpack.

[Speaker 4]
Buddy, you can't give us a really shitty system and then tell us to stop worrying about it when it's crap.

[Speaker 1]
I can fix the backpack thing later. That's what I'm saying.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, great.

[Speaker 1]
I don't even know what's encumbering you right now.

[Speaker 3]
I was trying to explain it, but I'll wait.

[Speaker 4]
And I get two actions? Is that it? Yep.

Alright, then I'm done. I'm useless, as always.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you raised your shield? Oh, that's good.

[Speaker 1]
None of them have died. Oh, they're incorporeal, so they can't grab. That's been two actions.

[Speaker 3]
So Rose isn't grabbed?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Rose is not grabbed. That's a mistake on my part.

I missed...

[Speaker 7]
that one.

[Speaker 3]
Is that void damage?

[Speaker 1]
It is void damage. What happens when I click that? Oh, it says there's no damage.

[Speaker 3]
He's immune!

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's interesting.

[Speaker 3]
Because he's one of them now, so he's going to be immune to most of their attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Amazing.

[Speaker 3]
Good for him, good for him. Does he heal from void? He heals from the skull's charm.

Okay. Which is the opposite of heal.

[Speaker 1]
Good, good, good, good. Who is Dr. Basha next?

[Speaker 2]
Alright, let's see who the most beat up is. It's this guy near Denton. I probably should deal with the person next to me.

It's fine. If I deal with this, then the tank can come over. We're casting Force Barrage.

And using all three of my actions. Do I roll it three times? Or are you just going to multiply it by three?

The darts for Force Barrage? How does this one do? Oh, you roll damage separately.

Okay, okay. Two, three. Alright.

And those are my three actions. Oh, he's dead! Alright then, that will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Move one of the hazards to its space. I'm just going to activate where it's turned to be.

[Speaker 5]
Whoa! It's just running off?

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. It got vanquished. The trap is there now, where it once was.

[Speaker 7]
Indeed.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to come over here, raise my shield, and move it.

[Speaker 1]
Fergus, which is this guy. Okay, so a lot closer. So you can see the dagger has a kind of primitive firearm embedded within it as well.

And it is glowing. It has a lot of spider iconography all over it. Alright, I'm going to cast the add-in new thing for generating the attack.

That's cool. I just barely missed.

[Speaker 3]
Aha! Aha!

[Speaker 1]
What just happened there?

[Speaker 3]
I'm not sure. Did your little ghost touch weapon?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't think it worked properly. My computer is being really slow right now, I think because the battery is low. I tried to demoralize you.

I failed! That is his turn over. I will try to add that little ghost touch thing as well.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's when the enemy is attacked. Okay, that's when the enemy is attacked.

[Speaker 1]
There is next.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, realizing that my spells aren't too good. I'm not good against undead. That is a horrible thing for a necromancer.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I always forget that in order to get ghosts you need ghost touch things.

[Speaker 5]
So it's critical against this one for 10 damage. There we go. And then for my last action I guess Good, that one is destroyed.

And that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
And a new hazard appears.

[Speaker 3]
What? What are these?

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry about it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm staring right at them. What do you mean don't worry about them? I can see what they are.

[Speaker 2]
Don't worry about them. Gross. Just don't step on it, I guess.

[Speaker 5]
The problem is you're worrying about them and you don't want to worry about it.

[Speaker 3]
That's a big bomber.

[Speaker 7]
It should just let me...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, okay. One action. This thing should get one slash damage.

And this guy gets all of it. I think I'm going to throw another bomb. No, I'm not.

I'm going to walk closer so that an arrow can go through. Oh god, no.

[Speaker 7]
Let's see if this works. Oh well.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if that's going to work against the ghost, but...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's muted. My bad. Apparently barking is unintelligible and does not count as sharing a language which is understandable.

I didn't miss because of the shield. That is its turn. Meryl!

You kill it with a first hit.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, hell yeah! Walk away from the trap, yeah. Walk away from whatever this is.

Hell no.

[Speaker 1]
You have two actions left, Meryl. Each time one of these things dies, there's a little bit of ghostly light that appears in its face and begins getting hazardous.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You could try to mess with it, or obviously you could go elsewhere and return to killing.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have much other than smacking people. Well, I can demoralize. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You can also, you have occultism and religion and medicine and stuff like that. You also have diplomacy. You can do recall knowledge and stuff like that.

[Speaker 4]
That sounds like a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to recall knowledge, there you go. Yeah, you just press T to target somebody and you press that button the same way that you would attack.

[Speaker 7]
Very good.

[Speaker 4]
What is the seek action for? Is that for looking for something specifically?

[Speaker 1]
That's for, I believe for spotting Am I crazy?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so spotting hidden souls, enemies, traps, that sort of stuff. So if someone's in combat like a rogue and they're trying to hide, you can use it to actively seek.

[Speaker 4]
Gather information on the weird spots.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Technically that's exploration, but I could just treat that as recall knowledge with regard.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's perfect. You speak with your deity and Mom, what's that?

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Upon hearing you pray, the debris storm or the spirit that's about to begin whirling chairs and tables and cutlery around apologizes and fades.

[Speaker 3]
It's more like the Mom, they're touching me!

[Speaker 1]
My turn to play on the Xbox. There's a final remaining spirit hound, but where? Oh, I covered him accidentally.

Dr. Bosch is right here.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It's fine. Start fighting at the necromancers.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, ow. Alright, is this double damage?

[Speaker 1]
Or is it just the 8? I already rolled an SA critical.

[Speaker 2]
You're good. Ow.

[Speaker 1]
Aww.

[Speaker 2]
Praise be.

[Speaker 1]
I keep going at it. Dr. Bosch here.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Well, as much as You know what? I'm going to see how well they tolerate electricity.

[Speaker 7]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Does Clint have a vulnerability or a weakness to ghost touch?

[Speaker 3]
I don't The only thing he has is immunity to There is something he is resistant to, but I don't think it's ghost touch. It's something else, but it doesn't show up. So, I'm going to say no.

[Speaker 1]
That would have been funny to smack it in.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I mean, he's a ghost, so ghost touch would hit him.

[Speaker 5]
I think they play ghost plays differently. Like, you don't get the resistances that normal ghosts do, and you don't get some of the penalties they have. Which is totally reasonable.

[Speaker 2]
Oh good, it died. Thank goodness. And then I'll just cast shield.

But I dealt with that problem. Did it cast? Did it?

Okay, there we go. And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
The door behind the bar slams shut and locks itself on the movie locking door.

[Speaker 6]
Hey! Who's messing with my bar? Get out!

[Speaker 1]
You have the phantom footsteps.

[Speaker 5]
Can we bring out a Ouija board so we can talk to Clint?

[Speaker 4]
I'm right here! It's like I can still hear his voice.

[Speaker 5]
It's almost like he talks to me still. Phantom footsteps. Denton!

Denton's concerned about the footsteps. Aww.

[Speaker 2]
I guess he really is concerned about the footsteps. Hey!

[Speaker 1]
You're fine!

[Speaker 5]
Yay! I'm alive! Can I tell where that will say was coming from?

The audible footsteps? The phantom footsteps?

[Speaker 1]
No. You can make checks if you want.

[Speaker 4]
I apologize if you heard a large crash.

[Speaker 1]
Religious people can, if they're trained, can, and by trained people it just means you have proficiency, you can ritually ward off lesser spirits.

[Speaker 5]
And that is my turn. Hits and does no damage.

[Speaker 1]
Why does it do no damage?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, double resistance, which is not magical.

[Speaker 2]
And it doesn't take precision damage. I believe ghosts are immune to that, I think? That might be why it was none at all.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, why not? Oh, come on!

[Speaker 1]
Like this. I'm bailing the guy right in front of me. Critical hit?

Ooh. This is rough. Nah, we'll do it again.

I tried my best.

[Speaker 5]
Yay! Bear's turn. I'm gonna do my action for the hand.

That didn't work. I'm looking for the action for the hand. When I was casting the spell, it was working, right?

Like it seemed to affect it?

[Speaker 8]
It did seem to affect it, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so I'll do that one for the two attacks. I'm gonna do just only one target. And then I guess I'll try to appease the spirit?

Okay. Recall.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that would definitely work. Where is it? Bring us the rose!

[Speaker 7]
Yep. Um...

[Speaker 3]
Actually, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna hand you a healing potion. No, no, no.

I'm gonna do battle medicine on you. That's what I'm gonna do. Okay.

Sorry, hand.

[Speaker 7]
There.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Then I will do another battle medicine on this guy.

[Speaker 8]
Baby boy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, nevermind.

[Speaker 3]
Let's click! Click! I'm here.

I'm here.

[Speaker 7]
Oh... Let's try this. Boo.

[Speaker 1]
You're like me, baby. It's upsetting to you. It's humiliating.

You're such a large animal.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna cast shield on myself.

[Speaker 7]
Aww.

[Speaker 4]
Can you come back to me at the end of the round?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. I'm gonna delay your turn to end of round. Dr. Boshit!

Wait, Bar, why did you send me a private message saying that you messed up your leveling?

[Speaker 4]
Because why would I say that in public? Thank you for letting everyone know.

[Speaker 1]
You're welcome. It sounds better coming from me. I also messed up my leveling, too.

[Speaker 5]
No, no, no, no, no.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna check up your...

[Speaker 7]
Hmm...

[Speaker 2]
So now we are... Let's try electric arc since I don't think telep... will work very good.

Please do a basic.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this is Mr. Birgit. What are you doing? What?

[Speaker 7]
No damage.

[Speaker 2]
No damage?

[Speaker 1]
No damage. It does have rather high resistance.

[Speaker 2]
Oof, if that makes sense. Well, I will, um... I will just do a shield to them and then I will end my turn.

[Speaker 7]
You lot would work, Dr. Boshit.

[Speaker 1]
Phantom footsteps are then going to affect their reactions. Actually, they're just going to... They get their reaction back, basically.

That then brings us to Merrill.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, uh...

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Can I say that I used some of my movement last turn to move over here?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sure. I don't think you used all of your actions last turn.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Okay, I have a new feat. Defensive advance.

What is stride?

[Speaker 1]
Stride is any time you move.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. So I can make a melee strike as a bonus or something? So I can do two melee strikes?

[Speaker 1]
What it does is, with the protection of your shield, you dive in the battle. So you raise your shield and you move at the same time using this two action. Defensive advance is two actions.

It lets you move, it lets you raise your shield and if you end in melee right next to somebody you can also attack them. So it lets you get three actions for the price of two.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
That hits.

[Speaker 4]
Do I need to hit him again?

[Speaker 1]
Buddy, could you not apply ghost touch here? Oh, so I hear background noise. Who is that?

It's Bear!

[Speaker 4]
He's still up?

[Speaker 1]
He is still up, yeah. So he looks like he takes basically any damage under five he does not take.

[Speaker 4]
Ugh, dick. So because I made that melee strike as part of defensive advance, do I make my next melee strike without the minus five? Alright, fine.

I missed anyways. I think that's everything.

[Speaker 5]
Ready, on my turn I'm going to try to finish off the enemy. Mess with the balls, you get the horns. I want to throw a business card.

Does it seem like I can touch him?

[Speaker 1]
He is incorporeal.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to recall knowledge as my last action.

[Speaker 1]
I have to reveal this. Sorry, go ahead and ask your question.

[Speaker 5]
Resistances or immunities?

[Speaker 7]
Do they both count or just the one?

[Speaker 1]
You can't think of anything. Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Denton is struggling. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Fergus is going to move towards the lane.

[Speaker 5]
He's doing it. Attack of opportunity. Oh, you do have one.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, nice. Oh shit, I clicked blink.

[Speaker 3]
Oh jeez, I have shield. No, no, no, I used my reaction for shield. No, no, no.

Oh, I don't think shield would work. Well, I mean, it'll help. Oh, no.

No, it didn't help me at all. That sucks.

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't help you at all.

[Speaker 2]
Would a shield block reaction? Oh, no, you're right. Sorry.

You can reduce the damage a little. It won't block all of it.

[Speaker 3]
Never done it all myself, which means I've never done it before ever, apparently. Hmm. That's a reaction.

Where does 5 come from?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, because I think we're Boreal, so a piece of it, though.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, right there.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it would just take off 5 damage. I don't see the damage from Yeah, because it's not It's not doing it right.

[Speaker 1]
No, it does not.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's weird.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he has minus 5 strength because he's a Oh, okay. It's supposed to still do it, so I'm gonna roll. I'm gonna roll for crit.

This will be the actual damage. There you go.

[Speaker 3]
Ouchies! Minus 5. So, 14 damage.

And my shield is gone. Ow! Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
You're supposed to be able to interact physically with a There we go. With a ghost touch thing as if it's actually physical. Yeah.

That's the only thing you can interact with physically.

[Speaker 3]
Aw, this thing looks really bad.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, does it have something that's ghost touched? It does have something that's ghost touched.

[Speaker 2]
Can you benefit from healing potions, Clint?

[Speaker 1]
It's weapon is ghost touch.

[Speaker 2]
I don't.

[Speaker 3]
I benefit from harm, I think. Oh no. You have a herald?

I believe healing potions do affect You are damaged by vitality damage and aren't healed by vitality healing effects.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so potions can fix you.

[Speaker 3]
Right? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, potions aren't vitality, so they affect them. Yeah, and I think you can also treat wounds because that's also unmitigated healing.

[Speaker 3]
When it's Rose's turn, she'll heal Clanker if you go before Rose and you can do something, but yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
There's also a feat called stitched flesh that will also do that. There.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I'm gonna command my guy to run up here and try to disarm him. Ayy. How do I do a disarm on this minion?

[Speaker 1]
Click on him, then click basic action macro.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Dissection, disarm. Success!

Pretty nice. And let's all And I don't really have much else I can do over here. I guess other action Yeah, that's all I can do, sorry.

Oh no, no, sorry, I go there and I Can I throw it? Throw the weapon at someone as part of an action? Off the ground?

No, so you weaken your target's grasp on the item And further attempts to disarm Okay, alright, nevermind. I'll stay over there and I'm not gonna do anything, I'm just gonna end my turn. Further attempts to disarm Wait, no Did I recall knowledge on this guy?

Use my action to recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. You are trained in occultism. Cool.

I have something for recall knowledge in combat. So looking at it, you know that it's resistant to all damage 5, except for force, ghost touch, and vitality. And has double resistance to non-magical damage.

Additionally, you recognize that the It's not from It's not from Torbell, necessarily, but it is enchanted with a couple extra runes from Torbell. It's wielding something that's been enhanced by the hollow of spiders. A little while back, that clink died on the way too, but the dagger itself is not originally from there.

You can tell that spider design is much older. That is why the other one exploded with force barrage. Completely fuckin' annihilated them.

Alrighty, and I think Rose Oh, is it my turn?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to apologize, I only just finished Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'll just give him a shielding potion. An elixir, excuse me. I'll give him I'm looking at the wrong I should give him not put it in his mouth Uh Would that take all of my actions or do I get one more?

[Speaker 1]
Because I pulled it out, I opened it, and I gave it to him Then you gotta Oh Activate that Oh, because you had to move Yeah, that would take it Okay, so then I'm done.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's all good He's got three more hit points. Woo Stop getting so close to me Um Ooh Okay, I'm going to unleash my psyche I'm gonna disappear

[Speaker 2]
Understandable, have a great day Yeah

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, like I'm hiding behind the bar or something

[Speaker 7]
Like I'm concealed

[Speaker 1]
That's really funny Let me add Concealed Amazing Dr. Potion

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to try exploding this one but I guess it requires that I will hide Okay Cast Cast I am targeting it One Two Three And those will be my actions

[Speaker 1]
It's not looking good

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, didn't die, but close enough Alright

[Speaker 1]
Very, very poor Uh, the locking door opens and then slams shut again

[Speaker 2]
Throwing a tantrum

[Speaker 1]
Ghost light Move ghost light over Barrel on What?

[Speaker 4]
I wasn't looking at you, buddy Oh Ooh You sure can Have you used your hero point?

[Speaker 1]
No, I will use it and I will roll again You right click it Reroll with hero point Uh, it says reroll Keep new, keep lower, keep higher Uh, click reroll, keep higher I don't know why I didn't do that Hey!

[Speaker 4]
Wow Excellent work Oh yeah You have to click critical It's on the right side You hear in the back of your mind Kill it, kill it, kill it But you can't discern where it's coming from I feel like Meryl is pretty used to hearing voices that she can't place Yeah Oh, hey I think I have one more action And I'm gonna Recall knowledge See if I can identify what this thing is Which thing?

[Speaker 1]
Which thing are you talking about?

[Speaker 4]
The thing I'm hitting

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Fergus, the one that you just killed It's a ghost, plain and simple This one is a particularly vengeful one It was likely sent out by a patron Or it has some greater benefactor that's coming in, that's why it was armed

[Speaker 3]
The previous owner of the bar wants it back Overcooked Overcooked and cold dead feathers

[Speaker 1]
Meryl, you add a Let's see here, two things happen Disperse Two of those?

[Speaker 7]
Three?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay, that's There's that one, and that one Yeah, there were two Meryl, your longsword becomes a ghost touch Oh! Additionally, the ghost touch dagger has fallen

[Speaker 3]
Lucky bitch Ghost touch allows you to hit ghosts and do normal damage instead of like the half damage or whatever you've been doing

[Speaker 1]
And third, there are two ghost touch runes in the place of the spirits that you previously damaged

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to add those

[Speaker 3]
Rose is going to grab it and add it to her fourth hand

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to add all three of those to the party sheet I'm going to add them to the stash so you can all see them

[Speaker 4]
Okay

[Speaker 7]
Bless you

[Speaker 5]
Oops, I thought I muted what I wanted to say and made you listen to hear me cough

[Speaker 7]
Oh no

[Speaker 2]
It's like turning on the camera to record after you've done the recording

[Speaker 7]
I can't?

[Speaker 5]
That's rough Can anyone use that pistol?

[Speaker 2]
There's a few people who can use that pistol Can?

[Speaker 4]
Yes Should?

[Speaker 2]
Probably not Okay, and then who should?

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I've got that pistol I've got that pistol for dead and otherwise The dagger pistol Okay There it goes There it goes What?

[Speaker 1]
Your weapon auto becomes Go to actors, look at the very top, should be the party and if you double click on, what is it, open sheets right next to the folder Does Meryl's sword independent of the runes become a ghost touch sword?

[Speaker 3]
Yes Oh, neat Yeah I'm actually going to go in and manually Nice Does anybody want that last ghost touch? I mean, there are two of them Oh, there's two, okay Yeah, we can take one each Does Denton want a ghost touch Does he have a ghost touch already?

[Speaker 2]
He took the ghost touch dagger pistol

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, cool

[Speaker 5]
Denton doesn't really have a weapon So rather than a rune Something he can actually use for a range as well

[Speaker 3]
I'm just thinking how stupid it would be if Rose's four can had ghost touch

[Speaker 2]
Look, if you ever regret the decision you can extract the rune at another time

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's just funny

[Speaker 2]
So you can take the fork I'll take the other ghost touch I'm glad she can take the fork It's attached to her

[Speaker 5]
I can't remember if I want to ghost touch my natural weapons I need to get the hand wraps of Thanks, Jenna

[Speaker 8]
Good, it's been updated

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, two things One, it's been over an hour Go ahead and everybody add an additional hero point Vera and Meryl can each add an additional hero point on top of that for going after some of the spirits here And Klink is going to begin fading into the basement of the bar

[Speaker 8]
Oh dear

[Speaker 3]
As we fade to a commercial he becomes concealed again and you just see feathers and flapping and he's like

[Speaker 2]
You know that poem, Don't Rage Against the Dying of the Light? I don't Let me try and get it Rage Against the Dying of the Klink It's titled Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night which is when you immediately said that one I don't know I don't remember how to get the ghost touch on Can you let Penelope in, please?

[Speaker 6]
Whoa, it's the kitty cat that got stuck outside Poor cat Poor cat, poor cat Poor kitty kitty cat How do you get ghost touch on? What the heck?

[Speaker 2]
What are you trying to put it onto? The fork hand Do you have it as a weapon, the fork? Yes It's the dagger that I just renamed fork hand Okay, okay So if you click on your Click the edit tool Then go into details And then if you scroll you should see precious material and runes Okay So then what do I put it as?

Because I'm not seeing anything that says ghost touch To put ghost touch you need to put a fundamental rune on it first, I believe Yes, so put a plus one to your potency Okay But you need to buy the potency rune first, don't you? No, she stole it off a dead body, it's fine No, no, no, no, you fundamentally cannot apply One of those fun runes, like a ghost touch Without a potency rune Yeah, so the plus ones, plus twos, they actually allow So you have the fundamental runes, plus ones, twos And they actually allow you to add the other runes Hey, do you want your gun? That's a cool gun you got That's a cool gun, can I see it?

Denton, I think you should not let her see it Can I see your gun please?

[Speaker 3]
I just want to shoot something real fast Just above his head She'll non-lethally, non-PvP Stab you in the leg with her fork hand Let me see it! Give it to me!

[Speaker 2]
I need that rune! I don't think he's going to give it to you I'm dreadfully afraid You have your rune, I have mine Pew, pew, pew!

[Speaker 4]
And the little finger guns Merrill is very distracted Merrill is very distracted by the fact that She now knows her sword has a name It has a name? It has a name now! Whoa!

[Speaker 1]
Clinkz Bar is on the Isle of the Hidden Blood Oh, that's convenient There are a bunch of dwarven craftsmen So if you'd like to purchase a potency rune Or other runes to apply You can do so And fork, clinkz bar I'm going to check if I can even afford one How much are they?

[Speaker 2]
I'm checking Oh, weapon potency runes Plus ones are fairly cheap It's 35 gold Give me money!

[Speaker 8]
Give me money!

[Speaker 2]
You don't have 35 gold? No!

[Speaker 3]
Okay She'll start poking Dr. Abashi She's like, give me money!

[Speaker 2]
You said there were 35?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, it's 35 I need 16 gold! Give me money!

[Speaker 2]
I imagine you're stabbing him in the boot And he's just going to go like And hop on one foot You know that little thing when you're trying to dodge a cat That's running underfoot, right? Yeah That sort of hop Only if you promise Only if you promise to pay it back But please, stop stabbing me Fine, fine, I'll pay it back With like a A DC of like 2 She's not paying you back I don't even have to check, I just know What level is everybody by the way?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, 2 1 and 3 Rose is level 1 Which is why she's like Forcing people to give her money But I could have sworn you got some from The um, what's it?

[Speaker 2]
The labyrinth She has 19 gold She has how much? She has 19 gold, yeah Ah, okay This is why we do the Earn income downtime This is why you give me money! By the way, he will follow up On the 16 gold in the future, he will give it to you But he is going to prod you about it later 16 And will you Please stop stabbing me Alright, I'll stop for now But if I don't get my gold I just gave it to you Oh, you gave it to him?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, yeah, then she'd stop Wait, who are you giving it to? Um, Rose just bullied Dr. Basha No, that's awesome

[Speaker 2]
And he did say as long as As long as he pays him back And even though he can tell that Rose probably won't They're definitely going to check up again They're going to be like, hey, so Like in a few minutes Speaking of The doctor's going to go get himself

[Speaker 3]
Of course I have your money I'll just go get it, and then she runs away

[Speaker 2]
I like to think that we tried to pull Klink from sinking into the basement And then when it was clear that that wasn't working We're like, okay, just stay there We're going to get something

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I just told Mandy It's like the Jumanji scene Where he's like falling through the floor

[Speaker 2]
Have you seen Jumanji? I have, I think I saw the latest one But not the newer ones, the older ones

[Speaker 3]
I can find the scene I'm talking about the original one Yeah, I was just going to say I'll find it, but Bar's not allowed to watch it

[Speaker 2]
I see, yeah, I think I only watched the newer one Where they get stuck in the game version of Jumanji

[Speaker 3]
You need to watch the original, it's so good It's better than the newer ones The newer ones are good, but it is better than the newer ones It's so good

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll give it a check I'm having trouble

[Speaker 4]
I'm also echoing Sorry, I think that was hard I'm having trouble finding the cantrips I can get from my ghost hunter dedication

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was just about to ask about that Rufus, did you pick spirit lore or haunt lore?

[Speaker 4]
I went with spirit I was supposed to have Technically fortune telling lore For some reason And I changed it to undead lore

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's not going to stand up on its own, honey

[Speaker 4]
As part of having the death domain champion

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, alright

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you might have had that from There's an ancestry thing as well, so you might have been supposed to have both Yeah, you get Oh, sorry, you go ahead, I'm going to type this in the chat

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, it's alright I was just going to mention about how when I added the whole Potency rune and ghost touch thing It automatically updated the price Of my staff And updated the name too That's cool, I love that And I don't remember if I mentioned it before But I do love how the familiar stuff is all Automated, that is so useful

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that says me typing as Merrill That's funny

[Speaker 3]
Time to get that potency rune

[Speaker 2]
Speaking of potency runes I need to get some for armor, but those are infinitely more pricier

[Speaker 3]
And unfortunately Unfortunately for everybody else, this makes Rose Pretty much broke, which means she'll be

[Speaker 2]
Stabbing at people

[Speaker 7]
That's rough, buddy

[Speaker 2]
Listen, it's 50 more gold on my end To get an armor potency But I know she's going to be stabbing me for all 160

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just go ahead and add it to your inventory And then delete the gold for it

[Speaker 7]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I should be looking at proficiencies Here we go, so proficiency spirit lore Undead, and I'm going to add

[Speaker 3]
Fortune With ghost touch

[Speaker 6]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
You also have proficiency in fortune telling But you're going to get proficiency in a lot of skills And you're going to level them up very, very quickly

[Speaker 4]
Okay That doesn't Answer my question of How do I get these new cantrips

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so that's the second thing So you're just wondering What ones you can choose?

[Speaker 4]
When I go to add them I can't find ones that have The divination Enchantment or necromancy trait

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's because when you search for them Hold on, I do know how that's going on So when you search for them And you add those traits Usually that means You're searching for things that have all of the above Rather than any of the above

[Speaker 4]
No, even when I select any of the above They just don't appear in the traits list

[Speaker 1]
Interesting

[Speaker 4]
Like under D where divination should be There's darkness, death, detection, disease, dream, druid

[Speaker 5]
So Just a moment So you don't do it in the trait It's in the school section

[Speaker 1]
Where is that school section? Yeah, I'm not seeing the school section

[Speaker 5]
So I use Archives thing to make it easy And then I just copy everything over Because I know the nethers So Share screen So the easiest way I know Is if you go to the school here Occult tradition

[Speaker 4]
Hang on, I'm not looking at your screen yet Ok

[Speaker 5]
So I'll do it in the overflow Because people are mean when I use the game channel So you can go there Ok, so this is for the occult tradition And then it has the different schools down here So you can do divination And I'll tell you the cantrip So you've got proximate, joint past, read air or time sense What was the other one again?

[Speaker 4]
How do you get them from nethers into foundry?

[Speaker 5]
You just search it up once you've done it Ok So you just search You want to say divination To say approximate You just type approximate and drag it over I'm sorry, I spaced out for a second And I just saw chewed levents business card I'm sorry, you chewed what business card?

[Speaker 2]
Don't go for my inventory No, I'm not I'm looking at the chat And I don't know if Rose did it on purpose But I've just seen half eaten Well now it's half eaten, it was chewed beforehand Levents business card This is Nessie's inventory Again, spaced out and that's the first thing I see when I space back in Why is it progressing? Have I given any of your characters a business card yet? I don't think you've been in a game with Levent, James

[Speaker 1]
I haven't

[Speaker 2]
I made business cards And just every so often A character will find them in their inventory It seems Rose has been eating hers

[Speaker 1]
So if I go into the compendium browser It says it lets me sort by class and school I'm not sure if that's the case

[Speaker 4]
Oh James, when this session is over Remind me to tell you about what's coming up In the next big arc of my Dragon Age game

[Speaker 7]
Hell yeah

[Speaker 4]
Nessie is intimidated And probably should be

[Speaker 3]
Oh hey you're back Yeah I was accidentally muted I did do it on purpose Yeah They're chewed and half eaten And I showed it to you on purpose

[Speaker 2]
Well I hope they're enjoyable

[Speaker 1]
Do they? So on Pathfinder 2, do they just not show the school Anywhere in the For spells? Yeah for spells It should I've clicked on it Wait I can do a little screenshot Yeah if you show me where it is Oh!

[Speaker 2]
The traditions, arcane, divine, occult Those are the schools

[Speaker 5]
So occult is a spell list And then the divine is like the school

[Speaker 2]
Yeah it's not that Classes have their own unique spell list It's that some classes, some subclasses Either pick from one of those four Divine, arcane, the other one Primal

[Speaker 1]
The trait that ghost hunter has And maybe ghost hunter is just legacy

[Speaker 7]
I don't know

[Speaker 5]
It has to have the occult So it's from the occult spell list And then you search from the schools

[Speaker 1]
So when I'm looking at Pathfinder 2 On Foundry

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh there are schools beneath that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah if something is divination, enchantment or necromancy Where do I see that?

[Speaker 5]
So It should say something like that And you see at the top So the first one is arcane And then it has I believe it has It's ok I think it's because it's legacy content Because If I go in Foundry And I go to spells It has the traditions here We're now looking at the traditions Right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah So we're looking for divination Enchantment Which may just not exist Because it's remastered And right now I think virtually everything is done by traditions So Bar for the moment I'm going to let you just pick anything off the Occult spell list Oh I already found them in that thingy Excellent Excellent If it's already worked I'm not sure What is it? Divination, enchantment and necromancy?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah sorry I didn't realize you were talking to me

[Speaker 7]
Oh shoot

[Speaker 1]
There's I'm going to screenshot this I'm going to send you this one

[Speaker 4]
I saw that but since I don't have The invoke true name I saw that but since I don't have other magic It doesn't seem like it would be useful

[Speaker 1]
The one thing that you can do Is you can We're looking at invoke true name There is a downtime action that you can use for learning Creatures true names

[Speaker 4]
But again I don't have any Spells that I can use offensively

[Speaker 1]
Right Well you might now

[Speaker 6]
No not yet Oh not yet okay

[Speaker 4]
So I might take it later I don't have a use for it now So I'm not going to have it use up space in my

[Speaker 6]
Spell book

[Speaker 5]
That's reasonable Hey James can you delete The character sheet in chat Which one? It like the hand Oh

[Speaker 1]
I deleted it

[Speaker 4]
The classic It's still there

[Speaker 5]
Alright might need a bit of time to upload I'm going to delete it There you go Don't delete the new one that's in there The new one's a new one

[Speaker 4]
Don't delete the new it It belongs there

[Speaker 5]
It belongs here yeah

[Speaker 7]
Over

[Speaker 5]
You see It has grown

[Speaker 1]
Plus one status bonus to your choice of attack rolls Will saves your charisma based skill checks during the spell's duration Same bonus to you Hey that's pretty That's really good Okay alright so here's the deal I've given you guys a bunch of loot and stuff like that What I'd like to do is I'd like to have you guys do Downtime actions Or I think that this would be good I'd like to spend more time on Link and like the haunt proper Next week I have to use the restroom really bad

[Speaker 3]
If you do it next week it cannot be on a Friday

[Speaker 1]
It just can't be on a Friday that's totally fine

[Speaker 3]
Or it has to be earlier on a Friday Early on a Friday or not on a Friday

[Speaker 2]
Oh are we putting a pin on it for today

[Speaker 1]
I so I would like to Reason Reason being I'm probably going to have to go into work early tonight Okay Which is you know fine Because it means I get to sleep more before the work from home job tomorrow Yeah Yeah But I think the other advantage is that gives you guys a chance to make more money On downtime Buy money on gear and stuff like that And more importantly the protective call The kind of glowing light that was partially tangible That's been surrounding Clink ever since Clink died It's faded it's been cracking all day It's faded at which point Clink Clink sunk downwards And it's currently covering The entrance to the basement

[Speaker 2]
So I'm hearing

[Speaker 5]
It's now Alba

[Speaker 2]
No There's a crow on there that would peck you if you tried And also I'm pretty sure A lawyer from whose character was the lawyer again Rose Lee So I'm afraid you can't just invade As funny as it would be

[Speaker 5]
Yeah I'm pretty sure we just cleaned out

[Speaker 3]
Whoever dies is permanently banned from this establishment And will be hurt

[Speaker 1]
Amazing But Can I just create a second party and add that for The kingdom

[Speaker 3]
Oh what's that I don't think Clink's gonna be able to do Downtimes

[Speaker 1]
Clink is currently In a hell of his own memories at the moment

[Speaker 3]
I may be sinking down into hell But I can still run this bar

[Speaker 1]
So your bar is It's a level As far as I know it's a level 5 organization I don't know what the restrictions are As far as like the level of an organization versus the character But The gold that you would get from The gold that you would get from Your investment would be enough to hire Have 10 hirelings for one year For the bar

[Speaker 6]
Wow

[Speaker 1]
That's very good You level up organizations in Pathfinder 2nd edition Based on how many followers they have

[Speaker 3]
So do I have the 10 or do I need to pay for the 10

[Speaker 1]
You get the 10 By Sort of Oh

[Speaker 3]
Okay yeah I can do that Oh Can I hero point that Can I hero point my downtime

[Speaker 1]
Can you hero point your downtime Yes

[Speaker 3]
Technically in session Yeah There we go

[Speaker 1]
That's good Yeah

[Speaker 3]
At least in my little brain If it's during the week We don't get the hero point Might as well

[Speaker 1]
That's totally reasonable I got to go use the restroom I'll be back No problem

[Speaker 2]
You know Today's session report is going to be real easy So does anyone else want to grab it

[Speaker 3]
I can't I would love to do session report But I cannot trust myself

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough

[Speaker 3]
There's still two that I said I would do That I haven't done and I'm never going to do them

[Speaker 2]
For the last session one The one that they were apparent skeletons at Did anyone else offer to do the report for that I very much was not there Oh for who I missed a session I think last week Because I needed to sleep Last week Just last week

[Speaker 3]
I don't remember what last week was

[Speaker 2]
All I remember was mentioned being skeletons That was all I garnered Who ran last week I did

[Speaker 3]
Oh you did okay sorry I ran the two You ran Who was there I don't think I was there Oh okay Because it was king maker Friday Which one is me

[Speaker 4]
I have a question

[Speaker 3]
Yes

[Speaker 4]
That one Yeah good job Can I do gather information In your sheet

[Speaker 3]
In the actions tab There's encounter exploration And downtime And then you can click browse And if it pops up in there the answer is yes

[Speaker 4]
Oh okay thank you

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I don't see gather information But I think there's other There's study Or practical research There's a bunch of other things Think earned income Is there stealing Can rose just steal That would be a thievery

[Speaker 2]
Earned income

[Speaker 3]
In a moment What are her skills She's level 1 Okay rose What are you going to do for your downtime What's she trained in She's trained in

[Speaker 5]
I'm trained in minotaur lore

[Speaker 3]
Thievery, stealth, occultism Medicine, crafting arcana, survival And intimidation

[Speaker 2]
Nice I got undone lore

[Speaker 5]
From undertaker

[Speaker 2]
You can be a mortician Yes I don't think you want to be a mortician

[Speaker 5]
That's how I started

[Speaker 2]
Indeed You can use intimidation and that's how you're mugging people Okay so earned income So roll your intimidation And then check the table Okay

[Speaker 3]
She's got one hero playing because she needs it She doesn't need it Hell yeah

[Speaker 2]
Huzzah

[Speaker 4]
Couldn't find me in that window Pardon me yelling at the cat

[Speaker 2]
No problem So at level 1 and trained If we're doing it for all 7 days You would earn in total 1.4 gold over the week Oh cool Or 2 silver per day if you want to do it day by day No I want the easy 1.4

[Speaker 3]
Okay so 1 gold 4 silver Yes She is 14 away from technically being

[Speaker 2]
Huzzah 14 away from Oh nice Just 14 more to go Technically

[Speaker 5]
That's a fail

[Speaker 4]
Can you explain how to use the table again

[Speaker 2]
Oh okay yes What level is your character 2 Okay so you go to task level then to 2 And then you roll your First roll what your What task you're going to do No no Ver was right on that part I did mess up the order slightly Thank you Nessie Bar what are you trying to do to earn income

[Speaker 4]
So I went with Spirit lore Which could be like settling ghosts Soothing spirits Just kind of general Church of the dead stuff

[Speaker 7]
Awesome cool

[Speaker 2]
Hold on let me expand the table Oh it doesn't give you the Hold on I'll just screenshot the And put them in chat so you can Look at them in chat That might make life a little easier for you Alright Rare downtimes I'll check that out later So for earn income you roll the 24 For spirit lore which would be a success At level 2 you're trained In that lore only right and not an expert So you go to task level You go to 2 and then you go to trained Which is 3 silver But if you want to make

[Speaker 4]
I can't go to the DC that I made and then go over to trained

[Speaker 2]
Oh I wish Do you know how much money I'd be making No I'm afraid you can't do that Yes it's 3 silver If you want to do it over the course of the week that would be Gold 1 silver in total

[Speaker 4]
Oh ok yes So it's per day

[Speaker 2]
I should have probably clarified Yes it's 3 silver per day So 2 gold and 1 silver for the entire week

[Speaker 4]
Alright thank you

[Speaker 2]
You're welcome But it would be so great if you could just go to the DC Alas

[Speaker 4]
There actually isn't that big of a difference In What I make Doing it 7 days a week Level 2 trained And doing it level 8 trained Once There's just a 4 silver difference

[Speaker 5]
Level 8 Level 8 is like 2 gold per day

[Speaker 4]
Yes because I rolled a 24

[Speaker 2]
Yes and you work harder the lower level you go Get richer type of beat When you're a higher level you can earn 2 gold a day When you're a lower level it's 3 silver

[Speaker 5]
Also the CR is a lot higher And then if you get a critical fail There is penalties for a critical fail So like a level 8 I think the DC is 23

[Speaker 2]
It's 24 which is what she got

[Speaker 5]
So if you roll like a 14 or something You get a critical fail, you waste the whole week And you also suffer a penalty So a critical fail you earn nothing for your work And you're fired immediately and you can't continue at the task Your reputation suffers Potentially making it difficult to find rewarding jobs in the community in the future

[Speaker 2]
But the point is Just for ease you're always working At your level appropriate thing But like James said Occasionally higher level things may pop up But that I believe would just be announced Yes But those would be announced

[Speaker 4]
And in my down time I'm going to be investigating my new sword My apparently named sword

[Speaker 2]
So are you earning income Or are you investigating your sword

[Speaker 4]
I'm earning income But like you can't spend every second of the day Either sleeping or earning income

[Speaker 5]
So for the purpose of this Mechanically though I was joking

[Speaker 2]
Sure I mean you are doing spirit lore So I guess you could be like as she's working She's looking around but it wouldn't Be you're highly concentrating on it

[Speaker 5]
I'm scared that my hand is now A medium sized creature

[Speaker 2]
Why did it get bigger

[Speaker 5]
Because I just got the mature companion and it goes up a size

[Speaker 3]
I love that feature because now it's just creepy

[Speaker 4]
It's big It's big enough to ride

[Speaker 2]
You know Before it was just oh it's an undead hand Now it's sort of being implied That it's growing So is it linked to another creature Does it want the hand back I mean it is friendly enough to you But where is the hand it's own creature Things to ponder

[Speaker 5]
I have the ritual creature crate undead For zombies And lore wise It is the creation of one of my creatures

[Speaker 2]
Nice okay cool So it just grows bigger

[Speaker 5]
As my skills increase

[Speaker 4]
Imagine how big the hand would get If you built a hand using femurs instead of phalanges

[Speaker 2]
Spooky

[Speaker 4]
Also a lot of dead people's legs

[Speaker 3]
Yes Okay Would Meryl have a problem with Klink Because Klink is a ghost A spirit

[Speaker 4]
She is not sure if Klink is 100% dead So she figures that either He needs to get fixed and go back to being living Or get helped along So she is on his way to accepting that he is dead And moving on to the next realm She isn't sure what it is yet

[Speaker 3]
She'll find out that he is dead He died He full on Pathfinder died No more Because James put us against a big ol monster And he crit Klink and got double his health So he died But James let him become a ghost

[Speaker 2]
I wonder then If Meryl is just kind of icked out by Verza undead hand thing

[Speaker 5]
I totally pretend it's mine as well Like you just say there is this human hand that comes on my slave And just detaches

[Speaker 3]
Aw man you can't do it anymore Um Okay It's hard to tell if we were able to flee Because James did say we were all trapped In some like encircled thing Of mines and stuff So it's still his fault again You can't do it anymore But you totally could have done the trick Where you're like shake my hand But it's like your minion And you pull your hand away And you're like oh my hand fell off

[Speaker 5]
Yeah I do that to new people that don't know

[Speaker 3]
Your hand is too big now to do that

[Speaker 7]
I laugh

[Speaker 4]
Meryl takes a very pragmatic view Of practitioners of necromancy Because If they are willing to work beside her Then clearly They are not evil enough to be Her problem to kill

[Speaker 7]
Okay

[Speaker 2]
That's reassuring

[Speaker 5]
I hire my minions as cheap labor and farms

[Speaker 8]
Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Yeah the ghost dedication Specifically says that Clink needs to have Like a goal or something that would help him move on But the problem with Clink is that's not his style The wee bit of a workaholic

[Speaker 4]
I have an idea Oh I know I'm not going to tell you yet

[Speaker 3]
You do this every time It's not fair Look I'm going to say these cool and obvious things That Nessie isn't allowed to hear

[Speaker 4]
Are you not going to be here Next time when we Look at this big bad monster but Nessie can't see it

[Speaker 7]
What was that one

[Speaker 3]
You did that in When in RPG's You were like guys look at this being Look at this monster but then you spoiled it And you said Nessie don't look You've done that like three times

[Speaker 4]
Because they always whine about it

[Speaker 8]
I'm pretty sure all of those things

[Speaker 4]
Are things that have been revealed So far

[Speaker 3]
Today you're like James We need to talk about what I'm going to do Like I'm not in the room

[Speaker 5]
I will be here next week I'll be on holidays I don't think I'll be there

[Speaker 3]
Talking about Saturday games Or I'm talking about Saturday games I don't know what we're going to do next week Because I'll be busy on Friday

[Speaker 4]
I need to figure out How to record our games

[Speaker 3]
I think Otter used to record it With OBS studio I can ask her

[Speaker 6]
Are you going on holiday

[Speaker 4]
That's cool

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to the Philippines

[Speaker 4]
Have fun

[Speaker 5]
I met my partner When she was on a student visa

[Speaker 4]
In Australia

[Speaker 5]
Still in the process of getting a visa To come back to Australia

[Speaker 2]
Best of luck to them And have fun in the Philippines You're going in summer I hope your place has AC

[Speaker 5]
Definitely They went out for a holiday Somewhere the other day With a family And the place they went to didn't have a fridge What do you mean it doesn't have a fridge?

We went to see the family in the province And there's no electricity I'm like what? There's no electricity out there It's not worthwhile to put the power lines in there That's crazy They probably have other storage systems And food preservation They don't have much food preservation Really?

[Speaker 2]
I'd imagine you'd have a style They probably have a lot of canned goods They just don't eat meat You don't need much storage for rice It's true, rice can be stored dry Spam, do they eat a lot of Spam?

[Speaker 4]
Sometimes Spam, Spam, Spam Spam, Spam, Spam I had an entire box set of Monty Python When I was like 8 That's awesome Were there other questions?

[Speaker 5]
What's the meaning of life?

[Speaker 2]
42 Asterix This isn't to do with immediate But how exactly should I be playing out I was just thinking that But Mimosa being a Noble Yeah Do you have to pay Nova?

[Speaker 3]
That's something I have to do

[Speaker 2]
Counseling is also A bit separate to Noble work I know it's Kingmaker adjacent But I'm not too sure how to go about it Don't run out of missiles I don't know what to do

[Speaker 5]
I guess it's just this forever

[Speaker 1]
I took a dedication that was all kinds of fucked up From a cannon

[Speaker 7]
I feel sad I got an unvair

[Speaker 2]
Oh right It was the possessed one

[Speaker 1]
It's the fucked up I think it's living vessel I defined it

[Speaker 2]
That one was spooky

[Speaker 1]
And then I got a skill feat For reveal true name

[Speaker 2]
Nice I was going to take the true name cantrip For the doctor for flavor reasons But then it occurred to me That bad guys don't typically give you their full names

[Speaker 1]
No but what you can do Is you can find You can literally find With downtime And there's a bunch of them People's true names Which is crazy

[Speaker 2]
Also back to the council work thing How do I roll for this stuff

[Speaker 1]
The councilor thing Good question

[Speaker 2]
Also follower wise How would I go around getting more followers Also I did the math on how expensive 100 unskilled hirelings would be for a year It is a lot of money

[Speaker 5]
No It's

[Speaker 2]
300 Yeah it's 10 gold a day So it's like 3650 No unskilled

[Speaker 1]
So unskilled are 1 silver per day

[Speaker 2]
They're 1 silver? I thought they were 3

[Speaker 1]
I could be mistaken Archives of myth says Unskilled is 1 silver piece And skilled hirelings are 5 silver pieces

[Speaker 2]
Ok

[Speaker 5]
While you're on that page How much is it for a caster hireling

[Speaker 2]
I think that would be skilled

[Speaker 1]
It does not mention a caster hireling I might treat them as a researcher

[Speaker 5]
Can I hire people to help me do my rituals I think a researcher would be perfect for that If my companion gets spellcaster abilities Can it help me in my damn time As a secondary caster

[Speaker 1]
1 yes it can 2 and that's totally fine That's the purpose of followers as far as I'm concerned A lot of you guys do cooler and cooler shit There is, it looks like Spellcaster equipment How did I I was searching for this for so fucking long ages ago And it's right in front of me right now Animals, fixers What are fixers

[Speaker 5]
For like gambling

[Speaker 3]
It's supposed to be a fixer

[Speaker 2]
Still So the council accounts as an organization And gaining more followers I imagine would be from hiring So if I hire people do I just rule They manage to convert X amount of people I genuinely don't know how it would work

[Speaker 1]
That's a good question, there's not a ton of rules When it comes to organizations to begin with But it slots in well to things like Victory point subsystems and stuff like that So I think your organization is your voting block

[Speaker 7]
And yeah Let's see

[Speaker 2]
Ok

[Speaker 1]
I think for the next, basically Any kind of modifications to it that Happen as a result of game events will be things like Oh there's windfall, there's a sudden issue with your voting block Now you have to go spend money if you want to recover them Or do something else to go get them back But for the moment probably going to use the mob that you guys had Yeah I think that's going to work very well actually Using the mob that you guys had I think of them as friendly forces or something In Brawnlock as being your Yes, ok As being your followers For that next year

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry I didn't catch all of that

[Speaker 1]
Yeah sorry So I'm going to use the people that you guys were recruiting To basically form a friendly mob Against the demons in Brawnlock As your voting base

[Speaker 2]
Ok, so do I just keep track of My rolls and stuff? When you ask keep track of the rolls, I don't know what you mean by that Right, before I became council member I rolled a lot of Saving people from demon stuff During one of those Oh you get 12 people from that Should I record down every single instance of me doing that during downtime?

So it can be looked at later

[Speaker 1]
I think I think I already have the grand total Which is 70 something Wow I don't think it's 70 Give me a moment Sensation has low from 1 to 20

[Speaker 8]
Ok cool

[Speaker 1]
Shoot maybe this is the thing that we use For people making New PCs and stuff like that As they come up as tenants For increasing that base level Increasing the starting character level Yeah I just had a thought I couldn't resist it

[Speaker 2]
I mean hey, it would establish character relations as well

[Speaker 1]
Alright, before I go Does anybody else have any other questions for me?

[Speaker 5]
With the free archetype, are we bound to the 3 faiths Before we choose a second archetype If we're choosing an archetype without class feature?

[Speaker 1]
I feel like I asked that question in chat a few days ago Because I did not know the answer You're the person to ask I'm not the person to ask, I just work here What's the question? The only difference between a normal character And free archetype characters Is that the character receives an extra class fee at second level And every even level thereafter That they can only use for archetype feats

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, it just gives you more stuff It's fun

[Speaker 1]
So they're extra class feats They're not like extra dedications

[Speaker 5]
So it has an effect If the group all have the same archetypes You might want to ignore the free archetype And select a certain number of feats What?

[Speaker 1]
Which we don't have that restriction Intentionally, because that would be more work for me It also wouldn't make sense But that was like an added bonus to it making more work for me That's already being untenable I'm trying to find a good place to search for downtime activities Wait no, I should do it in Foundry What am I thinking? There we are, there's McKannon Who is slowly healing

[Speaker 2]
Oh, actually I did have one last question Because I realized it wasn't mentioned before I did the mapper hex of the Hidden Bluff But I do understand that the Hidden Bluff is full of traps So I was just wondering How much of the Hidden Bluff did I manage to map Before running into something too high level And me making it run out of there Where was this downtime action? Let me grab it

[Speaker 1]
McKannon, let's go to actions Actions, downtime And I can just browse downtime actions here

[Speaker 2]
That found it Copy message link Here it is in voice overflow

[Speaker 7]
So that says downtime

[Speaker 1]
I don't see Learn True Name on there Let me answer your question That was on the 18th and you were mapping it

[Speaker 2]
Map the area Is an actual activity Let me just

[Speaker 5]
There's also the Learn Downtowner Attracting voice overflow for you

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so that's the regular Learn Name But there's also one specifically that's Learn True Name Or is No, you might just be Let's see here I feel like it's described differently here Am I insane? Let's double check

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to hop off, have a good day

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, have a good night Hey Hey

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's a Kingmaker one Interesting Which is this You're going to have to remind me of that one I'm going to have to think about that

[Speaker 7]
Okay There we go

[Speaker 2]
That was all my questions So I It is technically morning Goodbye

[Speaker 1]
I'll see you, thank you for playing

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for running, it was excellent

[Speaker 1]
Next week we're going to do a lot of Nonsense

[Speaker 4]
I apologize for insulting Pathfinder yet again When I got frustrated

[Speaker 1]
It happens, though I was going to yell at you Because your speed would have been reduced by 10 feet Had you been encumbered in 5 feet

[Speaker 4]
Eh, 5 feet

[Speaker 1]
Maybe even worse So

[Speaker 4]
We've gotten out of the Introductory phase Mini arc Of the Dragon Age game And they are headed to their first big city Where I've got Three Interconnected stories going One of which is Starts off with A necromancer Who is becoming a witch But her lab assistant Stole the last thing She needed to complete her Lactary Which she had cursed to turn thieves into a cat So he turned into a cat and stole The gemstone And took off So she has been trying to chase him down And is in the big city So simultaneous with that She has started A plague in the city So that The city will die and she can Rule it as a witch with her undead lover And they're getting Their first real introduction To the Party of Adversaries One of whom is pretty I can't remember if I said he's pretending to work for the lich Or actually working for the lich Probably will depend on how well They do facing her down And he is Protecting the elven ghetto From the plague Because The rival party's goal is to End human supremacy I picked out some nice Character art for her So they're going to have to deal with The city being under quarantine And Mimosa's Kind of on again Off again pirate lover Knows that something important And valuable is coming into the city And is going to want the party to help Steal that But he doesn't know that the valuable thing Is a cat The guy that's been polymorphed into a cat So that's going to get interesting very quickly The final battle Professor is going to be A full on CR-18 Demi-lich Plus some spells because fuck you But I have a backup plan Where if they do Some things right Possibly if they end the plague And get rid of a mini-boss That's hiding in the nearby wetlands They'll secure the help Of this What's the name of it It's one of those Big angels But not a planer I think It was in Tome of Beasts Empyrean So I have set them up already To be pretty much Not in but affiliated with a faction That is Sending them to fight big bats They're not a Hiring group I don't know if you want me to explain Some of the political background of Dragon Age So in Dragon Age Inquisition Which came out 10-11 years ago There was This group formed Called the Inquisition And they had a lot of power But after they completed their goals After a couple of years They shut down So that the church Couldn't use them to pursue It's own goals But because there is another Threat to the world This Elven God of Rebellion Dickhead A not insignificant Proportion of The Inquisition's agents Are still active Still answering to the Inquisitor Just not officially the Inquisition anymore And the party started out As having been hired by one of those Inquisition agents And he's going to be their handler And send them Off to their quests

[Speaker 5]
That sounds cool I'll catch you soon I hope you have a great night

[Speaker 4]
Good night I'm excited I got the initial Shell of the quest The witch And the feet turned cat From Book of Random Encounters Not really fun shots but adventure seeds And then I just Made it more complicated So it is from The Game Master's Book of Random Encounters By Jeff Ashworth It comes from Something like Black Hobbit Productions And they put out a bunch of A handful of books Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master I don't have that one I have Game Master's Book of Non-Player Characters And another one I think, I'm not sure They're really nice Just for reference and Inspiration Yeah, that sounds likely He has Game Master's Book of Instant Towns and City Legendary Location More Random Encounters

[Speaker 7]
I am back

[Speaker 4]
Huzzah! It was really weird to be talking to myself There

[Speaker 1]
It's any kind of experience You have to be able to spontaneously Go off in these sentences and go to the next one I don't know how people do that at the same time as video gamers So I do have Instant Towns and Cities Some of them I was I definitely had a difference in taste When I was reading through those A lot of times when I'm making stuff for Kevin's Valley or anything else For settlements especially I'm trying to think of Specifically, there is this chance of this thing going wrong I'm trying to invent very specific events For people to trigger off of And for things to happen passively Things are easy to manage But can happen passively in the background So that they can activate at some point I feel like there was Less of those I didn't like how they were presented In the Instant Towns and Cities Even though I didn't like how they were presented Because I thought the events themselves were really cool I kept feeling like I wanted more Here's the version of Innsmouth I want to know exactly when The mermen rise up Or the fish people rise up Which one are they going to Give me a Give me a condition for something Just erupting spontaneously Which is really helpful when you have other people running factions In the game especially Because it kind of keeps them I don't want to say on a leash But it helps They need challenges injected into the game If they're not being challenged By other factions It's usually a good idea The reason I like

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, me too, I need to go to bed The reason I like the books Is they're great for The seeds of ideas So I found somebody In the book of non-player characters That just sounds like A lot of fun as a villain And I'm going to build something to use him in

[Speaker 1]
No, for real Because they're good Really good Alright, I'm going to bounce and get ready to go grab some coffee

[Speaker 4]
Alright, goodnight

[Speaker 1]
Goodnight

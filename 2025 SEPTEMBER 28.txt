[Speaker 9]
...joining us, but hopefully... They got banned for their crimes, as they deserved.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I still don't know what they did, but, you know, I'm sure it was justified. They committed heresy. That's all we need to know.

Heresy of the worst kind.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 11]
I saw the conversation. They were being really annoying about character creation.

[Speaker 5]
Are you going to do that voice the entire time, my dude?

[Speaker 9]
Nah, I just mind playing my character. I'm just trying to get used to it. Fair enough.

Fair enough. Continue. Fine.

I'll explain.

[Speaker 11]
Well, if I'm being given explicit permission to do it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, shit. Oh, Astra, you still need to help me with my character.

[Speaker 3]
I do. Hey, James. So, character creation is now at level three, right?

[Speaker 1]
It's level two. Unless you run a game.

[Speaker 3]
Level two? Okay. Alright, never mind then.

[Speaker 5]
I was going to say, I'm definitely not running a game. I'm too dyslexic for that shit.

[Speaker 3]
Can we throw all the characters in the party into the void?

[Speaker 11]
Ah, yes. Let me get... I'm just trying to figure out which of these sheets is mine.

[Speaker 5]
It'll have your name on it.

[Speaker 1]
It will not have your character name on it if you created it with a character name. Have you created an actor in Foundry before?

[Speaker 11]
I have filled out a sheet on Foundry. I don't know how to make a new one.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so that's what we need to do first, I believe. What's your character's name?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I put him over in character creation. His name's Drovosk.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we have not gotten a Drovosk, so what you need to do is go ahead and... Yeah, I'm going to eject Palutene. That person has been banned.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, it's under Lord Silver. Drovosk is a handy, strong, wieldy orc.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I have him down on the character creation page.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's under his gamertag, or his Discord name.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. What are you... Hold on.

Are you talking about on Foundry or on Discord?

[Speaker 2]
On Discord I have him down. I didn't know if I had to...

[Speaker 1]
Right, right. We gotta get that to Foundry. That's what I'm talking about.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I get you now.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to turn down the Spanish guitars real quick.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's probably a good idea. I'm going to turn you up also. You're kind of quiet.

[Speaker 1]
There we are. I was leaning away from the mic, so that's going to be... Wait, no.

Click guard. It makes sense. It happens.

Son of a bitch. Go ahead. Go to the Actors tab on Foundry.

I can lead you there if it's not obvious. And... A little person icon.

And there's another person icon below it that says Create Actor.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, okay. I see it.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. Yep, made him. I can just fill out his stuff real quick.

Because we're only able to, so it's not that difficult.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Esmeralda, you want to hop in a private really quick so you can help me with my character? Me? Yeah.

Um... Well, you can do it in here. I don't really mind.

It's not a big deal. Go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
I think the only thing we need to do is pick a... Archetype feat. Okay.

So that's basically a dedication.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah, we were looking at it earlier, remember? That's why... And then everybody...

Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Do they not have Guardian on here yet?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shoot. What did you make? A Guardian?

For some reason, that is exclusive to version 13. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Well, that's problematic. Yep. Alright, start another character.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. While you do that, I'm going to see if there's anything I can do for you.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, hang on. I'm going to pull from the pool of characters to see which one I can play.

[Speaker 8]
They're already working on version 14.

[Speaker 7]
Um... What dedication pairs well with gunslingers?

[Speaker 5]
I'll check Google for this shit.

[Speaker 1]
A ranger is... Let's see here. What does he have for his dedication?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you could do a ranger dedication.

[Speaker 1]
I was referring to the character A ranger. There's also the...

[Speaker 2]
What does he have? That's the name of a character?

[Speaker 1]
He's got... That's so funny. Spellshot dedication.

That's interesting. You cast arcane spells like a wizard getting a spellbook before...

[Speaker 5]
Firework dedication. Firework dedication. Let's read this shit real quick.

[Speaker 10]
Uh, you know what? I had been wanting to play a...

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. I'm torn between a monk and a champion. I'd say either of those are quite solid.

I'm seeing as I had gone into this wanting to play a guardian, I'll play a champion. D-d-d-dwarf.

[Speaker 5]
What does this even do? What does firework technician do? O-o-o-oathkeeper.

[Speaker 3]
Are you trained in crafting?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, probably not.

[Speaker 3]
No, you were not. Alright, so that one's out of the works. Um...

Ranger. Ranger dedication. You become trained in survival if you...

Yep, you have the... Basically you get hunt prey. What else do you get down the line?

At level 4... What does this mean? You gain first or second level ranger feat at level 4.

What does that mean? What is a... I guess that's just a...

Oh, okay. I get what that means. Never mind.

Ignore me.

[Speaker 1]
You backdate some downtime. Sure. I mean, at the very least, some of your downtime is retraining.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna try and re-up my Discord. Everyone's coming through robotic for me.

[Speaker 4]
I was just thinking, like, I don't know, a month's worth?

[Speaker 1]
But I didn't disconnect and reconnect, so mine just went down to red, so I'm gonna do that. Testing. 1, 2, 3.

[Speaker 13]
Erk.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, excellent. But yeah, if you want to do stuff like... I mean, spend ages.

If you want to do earn income and whatnot, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I think you should go with ranger.

[Speaker 5]
I will look at...

[Speaker 3]
Let me look at some of the ranger feats.

[Speaker 8]
Gain cascade.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I have a minor headache.

[Speaker 11]
Sorry to hear it.

[Speaker 10]
You're a fun one.

[Speaker 2]
Justice, holy aura, nimble reprisal so I can get around more.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, shit. I think I'm gonna look at spell shot really quickly, because I remember being interested in that. Already?

I don't remember why, but I remember being interested.

[Speaker 3]
You don't have the prerequisite?

[Speaker 5]
What's the prerequisite?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Way of the spell shot.

[Speaker 5]
Ah.

[Speaker 3]
How do I get that? I have no idea. Let's go to rescue.

Uh, no. The spell shot dedication, you're required to have way of the spell shot as a prerequisite. Neither of us have any idea what that means.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah, give me one more tonight.

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Sometime before you go to bed.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh, question? Yo. Uh...

When it comes to deity domains, do I have to be a cleric to access alternate domains?

[Speaker 1]
Or what, you're gonna have to tag whatever feature you're trying to access here. Sorry, what? Discord ate that.

Whatever feature you're trying to access, or whatever you're trying to do specifically, you're gonna have to put that in the chat, tag it, because I don't know all the lingo. Uh-huh. I'm still mostly just getting used to monsters and stuff like that, and I've only played the investigator.

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough. Uh... It's the alternate domains under Trud.

My Discord is really slow for some reason.

[Speaker 5]
Nappin' duo dedication business.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on a second, I'm gonna pick everybody, I'm gonna disconnect everybody. And then we're gonna reconnect.

[Speaker 13]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 10]
Howdy. Hello.

[Speaker 5]
Astral, can you read snappin' duo dedication?

[Speaker 3]
Sniping duo?

[Speaker 5]
That one, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Sniping duo. Um... When you take this dedication, choose one willing non-minion ally to act as your spotter.

Okay. This character does not need to specialize in any ranged. Blah blah blah.

[Speaker 10]
I'm gonna set my gear to 30.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think you should go with ranger.

[Speaker 5]
What does it give me?

[Speaker 3]
It gives you access to a bunch of ranger feats. I only saw four? You only saw four, but that's because you weren't looking in ranger feats.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'm gonna go with it.

[Speaker 3]
I went to ranger feats, and it says you can... There's things like animal companion, crossbow ace, hunter's shot, initiate warden, monster hunter, twin takedown... Okay, yeah, I'll do it.

Favored terrain, hunter's aim, quick draw, which you already have access to. I don't see it. Relentless stalker.

[Speaker 10]
Gotta have an adventurer's pack.

[Speaker 5]
How do I add it?

[Speaker 3]
Drag it.

[Speaker 5]
How come?

[Speaker 3]
That's strange, but fair enough. Drag it to archetype feature? Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Archetype slot?

[Speaker 1]
Remember, the primary thing right now is getting this moving. Remember, you are in Pathfinder 2nd edition. You're allowed to retrain.

Kyrona, what we'll do is we'll start you off with those ten arrows. And then what we'll do is go over the crafting rule specifics later on.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, sounds good. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I'll take dwarf lord. Between earn income and the crafting rules, that'll be super easy. Among other things, whatever kind of...

Basically, however many weeks it takes you to craft that other stuff would take about the same... There's usually a gold cost when it comes to crafting. It's actually really similar to how it worked in my campaign previously.

Surprisingly. It's really fucking similar where you're mostly spending gold. And then whatever money you need to fund that crafting endeavor, you could just earn with earn income.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
I need to write that down for BTT ideas. I want to be able to mark down something. This person is coming back after this many weeks.

How do I catch up?

[Speaker 10]
Alright, and then I'm just going to very quickly throw the path...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I saw in reference to your question from earlier, it looks pretty clear like the alternate domains are for... It looks like there's two specific feats for that. One of which is for clerics, one of which is for clerics and champions.

[Speaker 13]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
So a cleric can take Expanded Domain Initiate, or a champion... So that's not accessible to you. But a champion could take a Splinter Faith feat to redefine the domains available to them.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just take one of the non-alternate domains. There's still another one that works for me, and it does... It's partially just so I have an additional charge of Leon Hands.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think... Everybody, go ahead and drag yourselves up to the party sheet.

[Speaker 7]
Um, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what level is this all going to be. I don't know what character to bring. It's up to you guys.

[Speaker 5]
We got two new people, so...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, bring whatever you want. Honestly, bring a high level for like Sherpas. To like Sherpa the new people.

That's also totally fine. Because high level enemies, if you come across them, they'll focus on the high level people.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, James, did we... Did anybody decide for last session that me, Astral, and Heart played in? Did we decide how we were splitting that?

Because I didn't...

[Speaker 1]
We added the... Right, because you never fucking spoke to Heart. And you never collected the loot.

So, what I did was I had Heart take the... Oh, hi Heart! I had Heart take that gear.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
And then you all can... You're still free to split it up with whoever was in that session. Which I think was, what?

[Speaker 5]
Susudio... Yeah, uh... Pastro...

Uh... Arsonist Goblin... Arsonist Goblin...

I'm forgetting how... Fidel Castro. I'm forgetting how to say my fucking name.

Ficastro. Ficastro. It's Ficastro.

It's like Fic... Ficastro.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, it's a pun. Uh-huh.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's a... No, it's not a pun. It's, uh...

Fidel Castro. But, um... D&D.

[Speaker 6]
I see.

[Speaker 5]
I have no shame.

[Speaker 2]
Um, okay. I have nothing down on there, and now I'm gonna make her in the foundry. I do not have the permissions to create a folder, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
I'm thinking about bringing Kibi.

[Speaker 5]
Kibi! If possible, I'd rather not play a rat dungeon tonight, but if that's what all the other people want to play, we could play a rat dungeon. I don't really care.

[Speaker 1]
There's always rat... Listen, rat dungeon never ends. But, no, seriously.

Whatever you guys want to, uh... People earlier got to fight a rat gorgoyle. That was fun.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy. A rat gorgoyle? Well...

I... I'm not nearly high level. Oh, no.

Well, yeah. I'm a level two. Maybe I should...

Do Arsenis Goblin, since that's my lowest level.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like there's a bit of a power disparity in this party setup, from what I'm hearing.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there's... There's a... Most...

I think everybody except for Kibi is level two, so I think I'm gonna drag Kibi back and do Arsenis Goblin.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Heart, do you have the, um... The gold amount for, uh... The split for every character?

From last session?

[Speaker 4]
Oh!

[Speaker 5]
Uh...

[Speaker 1]
You guys got that gold. If you did not get that gold, then it's gone.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, well, because I only... There was supposed to... There was, like, 300.

I still have 80. But... It's fine.

It's not a big deal. It's just...

[Speaker 12]
Yeah. You still have...

[Speaker 1]
If there was 300 gold, and there were five people, then...

[Speaker 5]
Right, but I had 80 at the beginning of the session. I didn't get any gold from that session. Which is fine.

I don't mind. It's... Not a big deal.

It's just... You know. Yeah.

I'm trying to afford my guns!

[Speaker 3]
You're right. Heart's gonna be joining us, so I can bring a higher level, if they're bringing a higher level. Alright, Kibi's back.

[Speaker 1]
You bring a higher level anyways. You're like, make sure these people don't die.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi will make sure people don't die.

[Speaker 1]
Always a valid option.

[Speaker 5]
Who's trying to do... Who's trying to do shit? Someone's trying to do shit to my character.

Oof.

[Speaker 12]
Whoever's doing it, keep doing it.

[Speaker 5]
Stop touching my character inappropriately.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sorry. It also said something about mine. This is not a scheduled doctor's visit.

By the way, Scooter, other good choices for dedication are Investigator, Alchemist, and Inventor. So if we... If you train in another skill later on, like if you get...

Those require crafting, I believe. So if you were able to get the crafting skill, if you're able to train in the crafting skill, you can also retrain your dedication, so you can get one of those. If you don't like Ranger.

It's just a downtime action.

[Speaker 5]
Don't I have... I heard James mention... I think it was called Earn Income or some shit for downtime.

Doesn't Castrar also have that? Everybody does. Yeah, but he has a bonus to it.

Oh, right. Hold on. A big bonus to it.

[Speaker 3]
We were looking at that. Yeah.

[Speaker 13]
That should work. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. He does.

[Speaker 5]
Where do I see that?

[Speaker 3]
When you use Lore to earn income. Do you have a Lore skill? Probably not.

We do not have a Lore skill. How does one achieve a Lore skill, James?

[Speaker 1]
Mostly through feats and leveling up or background and character creation. But more importantly, he needs to... That's...

We're not doing downtime right now. Right now, we're figuring out where you guys are... Because I'm going to launch you head first into the Rat Dungeon.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, let's do a Sun Shrine. Let's do a Sun Shrine. I don't know, man.

Yeah, Sun Shrine's good. Eh, I'm fine with that.

[Speaker 9]
You know what?

[Speaker 3]
Isn't there a bounty board?

[Speaker 5]
Hold on. Yeah, let's do a fucking bounty. I'm a bounty hunter, so we might as well.

[Speaker 7]
Quest board.

[Speaker 5]
That's why everybody's down for it.

[Speaker 1]
I can do a Sun Shrine. I can do a... Let's see what Bear has prepared for me.

[Speaker 4]
My vote's for Sun Shrine.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. We can do a Sun Shrine. I am good.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a little nervous about a Sun Shrine, considering we asked James if level twos could play it, and he was like, I mean, sure. What was your exact words?

[Speaker 5]
That'd be a little bit difficult.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The Sun Shrines are so varied in level.

[Speaker 4]
Well, find us a low-level one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, that's my plan now, is there's Blue Doppel Hollow. Foundry? I know.

He said it's near... We're close.

[Speaker 10]
Set you to trained. Set you to trained. You to trained.

[Speaker 2]
Unburdened Iron, because otherwise my movement speed is 15 feet. And Dwarven Lore, because I like having skills.

[Speaker 1]
So, everybody, drive yourselves up to the party sheet. Let's see who we got here. We're going to handle initial introductions, and then I'm launching you guys out.

[Speaker 13]
I think everybody's in.

[Speaker 1]
Keep Eve, Castro, Minaya, and Magus Chiron. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Hang on, let me just move my character sheet up there.

[Speaker 1]
You just gotta click, hold, and drag and towards the... There's no scroll wheel while you're dragging, but if it's off towards the top... There it is.

Yeah, there you go.

[Speaker 2]
Ladies and gentlemen, Bastion.

[Speaker 3]
Ladies and little men, let's do this.

[Speaker 6]
That was a good pun.

[Speaker 8]
That is a haunt, vampire's tomb, there's the Temple of Zimmerick. That was funny. If memory serves...

Yep, I got Darkvision.

[Speaker 13]
So be it.

[Speaker 3]
How you doing, Curly? How you doing, Curly?

[Speaker 1]
For the benefit of the new person, everybody go around, introduce yourselves, with just race, class, or, sorry, name, character's name, and a brief one to two sentence description of your character's demeanor or appearance, if you want. You can be more descriptive if you want. No pressure.

Starting with... Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Well, Kibi is a catfolk, and a barbarian. They're not the brightest rock in the box, but, you know...

She's very sweet, and also very dangerous. But yeah, she's just a barbarian from an island down south. As you can see in her picture, she's got like a white and like tannish fur.

I don't really know what else to say other than she's a really big woman with a lot of fur. Yeah. That's Kibi.

Now I need to put eyedrops in this dog's eyes.

[Speaker 2]
An important part of the quest.

[Speaker 3]
Cat's sitting for six dogs right now.

[Speaker 13]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
I'll go next. Minaya is like a fairly large crow, but has just a few orangish feathers. She's wearing one of...

You know those friendship necklaces that sort of like join up the moon and sun? Similar to that she's wearing. Otherwise, she isn't much of note.

She's a bird. She's wearing a pair of socks. We're good to go.

Come on, girl.

[Speaker 5]
You're awake. I guess I can go next. Focastro is a male arctic elf.

He is wearing a classic military-esque uniform, and he has a holstered pistol. He is a gunslinger, and that is all. Yeah, he is a gunslinger.

[Speaker 4]
Kyrona is a young human woman wearing relatively light armor. She has a small pair of antlers, and she has been going increasingly insane as we've transitioned to this different world, so she probably has some dark circles under her eyes, and her hair is really messed up.

[Speaker 3]
Girl's going through it.

[Speaker 6]
Understandable. Ooh. There is probably shiny stuff in the Sun Shrine, which is beneficial for everyone, and I forgot to give the reason to why Manaia is here as well.

She's like, ah, treasure. Rather than, yes, we're saving the realm.

[Speaker 5]
Focastro is the same. He doesn't give a shit about the realm. He just wants the money.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's keeping you all alive.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you, Kibi.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, sorry, I was digging through. I was trying to find a good temporary image for my character just because I'm putting my stuff together kind of last second because of technical issues. Hrelga is a dwarf.

She is a champion of Trud. She's a very strong-willed, law-abiding person, but she also has a very short temper when someone is breaking rules, being evil, or acting the fool. Generally, she's going to be trying to keep everyone alive.

Yeah, because I'm a justice champion, and I got Lay on Hands, so I can reduce damage and I can undo damage. Nice. She is a short but firmly built woman with red hair.

She's wearing a full suit of armor.

[Speaker 8]
Very good.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know how to upload an image for her, so I put one under my character's thing on Discord.

[Speaker 3]
By the way, in the bottom left, you should be able to right-click on your name, and you can set your character to Hrelga.

[Speaker 2]
Player character. Okay, there we go. My options were that or, for some reason, Manticore parentheses Scorpion Tail.

[Speaker 3]
I still have to give that to Nessie's character.

[Speaker 2]
Damn, how many games do I have to run to be able to have a whole-ass Manticore?

[Speaker 1]
You have to save it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. The previous campaign, I almost had a dragon. I just decided, fuck it, and I stopped playing in the server, so I did not get that dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Damn. Yeah. Bro was on the cusp of greatness.

Nah, it was a baby dragon. It wasn't a big boy.

[Speaker 3]
A baby grows into a big dragon.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, true. True, true, true, true. But I was a goblin, so my age was like 50.

I wasn't gonna see shit.

[Speaker 2]
I do like the character named Magus Kyrona.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, her name is just Kyrona. She's labeled Magus Kyrona because she was originally a witch, and I'm trying to respect her.

[Speaker 2]
You know what? That's valid.

[Speaker 5]
You should join the Mechanicum. Become a tech priest.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if you know this, but my deity is a man with a hammer.

[Speaker 3]
Are most dwarves?

[Speaker 2]
He's not a very technical person. Also, I hope you like that I've traded out my bad Cockney accent for a bad Scottish one. I love it.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, Irohna.

[Speaker 1]
Oberon's been giving you information, feeding you info about how to... Very cool. Oberon's been feeding you information about how to get a head start on the Sun Shrines, especially since it seems like some of the Ice Fae are going to be coming back early.

The theme ballad of the Wild Hunt features Banassus most prominently is going to be taking place closer to Halloween, and the frost is going to be coming down from the north come the turn of winter. This year, at least. And Banassus right now is thinking of targeting Sol Brasier, so Oberon's been trying to figure out which of these places...

Everything's been reshuffled a little bit. He's trying to figure out if there are any Sun Shrines that are a little bit easier to... to get growing here without necessarily having to do really brutal combat, and Tor Bluedapple is the...

Yeah, Tor Bluedapple is the one to go with. It's about one day by sea, or sorry, one day by... Like half a day.

Maybe. I'd say two days total either way, at least. Between going over the water here in the center of Lake Bonaros, and then one additional day to go a day inland to Tor Bluedapple.

He's warned you that a aspirant of Banassus, somebody who's looking to prove themselves, is going to be hunting your ship during the process. Yeah. Now, he's not going to be...

All you have to do is either deal 10 damage to the rider, or deal 10 damage to the... Deal 10 damage to the rider, or deal 10 damage to the drake to dispel him.

[Speaker 3]
Got it. Wait, what mode of transportation are we taking?

[Speaker 1]
We're going to start off with boat.

[Speaker 3]
On a... over water?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. Oh no. Kiwi doesn't like boats or water.

[Speaker 4]
I'll keep you dry, Kiwi. Don't worry.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi got here via ship in a very unfortunate way. It crashed, or it sunk. So no water.

And no ships. Okay. Where would you like us to place our tokens?

[Speaker 12]
Gonna drop it straight in the center here.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. Oh! We're in the void.

[Speaker 1]
The gray void. Pop down a tile, keep this nice and simple. I just want to get going here.

I want to get started. Select. Create.

[Speaker 2]
Whoa. So just a slight issue. I don't have a token.

[Speaker 1]
What you do is you drag it out onto the... So it'll have a faceless appearance, which is totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was trying to edit it, and I think in the process I lost the original.

[Speaker 3]
What you can do is right-click your character, go to the, or right-click on the tile, wherever it is, and go to Appearance. Not Appearance, sorry. Resources, and have Attributes, HP, displayed for always for everyone, and that way we can know exactly where you are if you are unable to get the image sorted out right now.

So you'll have a health bar. And you can also do your name that way.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you see here, what you did was you copied over a link to, like, the internet.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I realized that. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you just gotta browse files. I think we're good to go. And if not, like I said, it's fine.

Oh, you're not even faceless, you're just beard.

[Speaker 2]
I am just, I am a health bar and nothing else. Because I don't remember how to upload images onto Foundry.

[Speaker 1]
Well, we're gonna be taking care of that later.

[Speaker 3]
I will have bought some potions beforehand, so I'm gonna go ahead and add those to my inventory.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, perfect. This is what we're gonna do for people who are struggling with their tokens. Fun.

This is the ideal. Yeah, it still doesn't show up.

[Speaker 3]
So delete this character and then redrag them.

[Speaker 2]
How do I delete it? Well, they can't do it here. No, I have to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. And it also doesn't work, so I just have to go to players, copy the path, do it for the token, and the prototype token appears.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, there we go. That is disgusting.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm not necessarily happy with having that glued to my face, but I get it.

[Speaker 3]
It's temporary. Isn't that Rez's character?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and that's also the one that I did to him.

[Speaker 3]
Jesus. That is cruel and unusual, James.

[Speaker 1]
Definitely unusual.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, there's a second Helga here.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. These are the pains of the token not being existent. Yep.

Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good opportunity. If you guys would like, you can do this. If you want to press up...

Yeah, if you guys would like to do exploration activities before any of these, you can do so.

[Speaker 3]
Phoebe's gonna be holding on to the floor.

[Speaker 4]
I'm imagining her with her claws dug into the floor.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there's like scratches all over the place from where she's like dug into the boards themselves. Sorry, but she can't really help right now.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, it's not Rez's shield. It's guard. Defend, that's it.

[Speaker 7]
Um, Picastro, what are you good at?

[Speaker 5]
I'm good at avoiding notice. something about writing. And gathering information and impersonation.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we should have made you an investigator, not a ranger then.

[Speaker 5]
I also have sense of direction and track.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, let me look at exploration.

[Speaker 4]
Where should I be looking for... There we go, okay. Ignore me.

[Speaker 3]
We could use a navigator of some kind. I did activate scout. Picastro has a compass, I believe.

I believe I said... Yeah, there's somebody in every session that wishes we had a compass.

[Speaker 4]
So... Does... Does scout...

Oh, what's the word I'm looking for? If you have two people scouting, do you get a plus two?

[Speaker 1]
Provided... I don't believe you get a plus two, but it does mean that if one person succeeds, it's additional chances to succeed or something like that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Stack is the word I was looking for.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so it doesn't stack.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. So go to the basic action macros down at the bottom, Scooter.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And go to exploration, it's the middle tab. Uh-huh, I'm already there, yeah. Go to sense direction.

I think that will cover... You have a compass, so add that to your... Add that as a thingy.

How? Let me look, I think it just gives a plus something, so just... Let me look.

[Speaker 5]
Where is your... Uh... It...

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
I know I have one.

[Speaker 3]
You do, I just don't see...

[Speaker 5]
It says... Uh... I think it auto-thinks that you have a compass, because the only option is no compass.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so you're good.

[Speaker 5]
So I got a nine. So I'm not as good at sensing direction as the caster thought.

[Speaker 3]
No, I do. Oh, Kibi has sense direction plus six.

[Speaker 2]
Is sense direction survival?

[Speaker 3]
Um... I don't know what it's attached to. Probably survival, but I'm in the basic action macros tab, and I went to exploration, and sense direction is an actual thing you can select.

[Speaker 4]
I'll be back in a second.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Mine's a plus five. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Gonna be watching out for big rocks. Titanic-style rocks. Just make sure we're not navigating into any kind of bad area.

[Speaker 5]
Why does one of the actions just squeeze... I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
And why do I have a plus eight in that? Oh, okay. Somehow, Kibi's giant ass has a...

let's see... has an eleven.

[Speaker 5]
Right, but the image is a fucking... is a fucking claw. So my brain immediately went to, like, squeezing something, like a lemon.

[Speaker 6]
I imagine it's because, you know, if you're trying to squeeze into a small hole, you're probably trying to escape a giant eagle of sorts, you know?

[Speaker 3]
That's fair, that's fair. I was thinking, like, you know, a room, the wall's closing in and you have to, like, squeeze out of it. Or maybe you want to squeeze through, like, you know, a cave that you're definitely not supposed to go in, because it has, like, a 300% chance of you dying and getting stuck.

Cave delving. You pointless sport. Oh, right!

There's a person with a dragon trying to kill us. Great!

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. So the area is fogged around you guys. I'm gonna have you add yourselves to initiative.

Alright. I believe you get a plus one, thanks to Scout.

[Speaker 3]
You remember how to do that, Scooter? Yes, you do. I'm not stupid.

I've already done this three times. That's true, that's true. My bad.

Um... What about you, Silver?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... I think I know how to do this.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I imagine I'd probably just be a perception?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, you could roll it with perception.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was gonna think of another skill that would be relevant.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I got one of the highest. That's nice. I can hear Grandpa coming.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, who are we waiting on?

[Speaker 3]
James, I think?

[Speaker 1]
Kyrona's gonna be back in just a moment, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. That was the one I was trying to figure out. Someone hadn't rolled, it was Kyrona.

We also have a bird.

[Speaker 3]
Minaya.

[Speaker 2]
I know, but we have a bird next to the bird, who I'm assuming is the bird's familiar.

[Speaker 3]
It's the bird's bird, yep.

[Speaker 2]
Out of curiosity, which patron?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, the flame one. Hence the fire background when you click on them.

[Speaker 13]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Faith's flamekeeper. Nice.

[Speaker 3]
Where do you see the fire background?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, if you click on the core, it should show up as their profile.

[Speaker 3]
No, I don't see it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, oh no. I guess that's it for Mayura's only. I'll just screenshot it.

[Speaker 2]
It's good that everyone's starting with Mayura. However, because I rolled the lowest on initiative, I will not be able to protect fucking anyone until my turn.

[Speaker 5]
Don't worry, I'll hide behind you. This is what I'm here for. I've done it before.

I'm not disappointed about it.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay, I see.

[Speaker 2]
I was looking at the wrong thing. Haroga just looks at you like crouching behind her. Buddy, you're twice my height.

I don't think this is gonna work.

[Speaker 3]
Also, I was clicking on Minaya's expecting fire background, but you meant the birdie. And the birdie does have fire.

[Speaker 5]
What's your character's name? Oh, holy shit.

[Speaker 2]
Dwarves are sized medium, but you know, they're dwarves. So they're beefy. They're on the short end of medium in the same way that orcs are on the tall end.

[Speaker 5]
I feel like there should be small in between for small and medium. They should be like...

[Speaker 2]
Eh, maybe. Though I feel like that does run the risk of just like dividing the sizes into a few too many categories.

[Speaker 3]
Where's number six? Who am I missing?

[Speaker 5]
Oh no, you lost a dog.

[Speaker 3]
I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and ask yourself too, Nishtu.

[Speaker 3]
Yep, I do. There you are, girl. I was worried about you.

Constantly counting the dogs. There's six of them, and if there's not six of them in my sight, I have to figure out who is missing. Oh boy, Kiwi's starting.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Now remember, everybody has the opportunity or the choice to... win.

You won.

[Speaker 8]
Is that uncommon?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there we go. Yeah, that's what I thought it was. You can always delay your turn.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
You know what? I will delay my turn for after... For after Ficastro.

[Speaker 5]
I'm just delaying my turn until...

[Speaker 3]
Don't do it yet, because it's not your turn yet.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I will delay my turn for after Ficastro goes.

[Speaker 13]
There's three left.

[Speaker 1]
After Ficastro. Easy way to do that is just click on your assist here. Delay, cool.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Alright. That's why I surprised you.

Yeah, okay. Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 8]
I'll check the fly speed.

[Speaker 1]
They're gonna come screaming out of the fog here. Rig is actually going to land on the ship.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wonderful.

[Speaker 3]
Just for future reference, could I have... I didn't see it on the thingy. Could I have delayed my turn for after the enemy goes, or did I have to pick one that I could see?

[Speaker 1]
It could be after this guy goes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, because that's where I wanted it, but I didn't know exactly where he was in the lineup, so I just picked after Ficastro.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. If I'm researching correctly with how delaying works is that you can declare you're delaying, and then after any turn you can just snap yourself onto the initiative. I sense a breath weapon is happening.

[Speaker 3]
Unfortunately, probably, yeah. Oh, everybody but Kyrona.

[Speaker 4]
Don't hit the bird!

[Speaker 13]
I'm doing it.

[Speaker 3]
Don't hit the bird!

[Speaker 4]
Caustic mucus. Tasty!

[Speaker 3]
Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I'll hero point that.

[Speaker 3]
Ficastro, roll basic reflex. Let's ho! Come on, you know how this goes.

[Speaker 1]
Just look for the little button in the chat.

[Speaker 3]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, very nice. Kibi takes nothing. Okay, Ficastro take half.

[Speaker 5]
I'll take it.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi's fur gave her an extra advantage on acid.

[Speaker 8]
Ass.

[Speaker 7]
That too.

[Speaker 1]
So he begins to move and then do two actions, so that takes three actions. Normally, this takes three actions. I see he fires his crossbow.

Or is it Kibi? Since Kibi did not get hit. That was a magnificent roll.

[Speaker 2]
I don't have a reaction until my turn. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
That is his turn now. Either Kibi, did you want to go right after or did you want to let Kyrona go first?

[Speaker 4]
Let me go first, please.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, you go first.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so first I'm going to attempt to demoralize and I make an intimidation check.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, let me, before you do anything, there we go. They're no longer concealed. Go ahead and target this guy with T and then if you click that, action intimidate.

It's also in your basic action macro.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, tits.

[Speaker 1]
That is an excellent opportunity to hit your point.

[Speaker 4]
To use O. I also have Oh no, attempt a skill check and haven't yet rolled for Fae's fortune. Alright, so I'll go ahead and try again.

And actually this time I'm going to use assurance, so it will come out straight as 14.

[Speaker 1]
Is that enough? Experience, intimidation, proficiency, and it should be higher.

[Speaker 2]
It should be a 6-10.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, when I opened it, when I clicked use assurance, it automatically switched off the attribute bonus.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay, so and also said unintelligible, so the one that you would have hit with, for a lot of these creatures, what you're looking at is like probably closer to like a 17 or or an 18 or whatever have you. And okay, no, no, no, I see what happened. It said unintelligible, but this thing does understand you, so that would have been a success.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so it is frightened.

[Speaker 1]
The drake itself is frightened.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, and for the rest of my actions, I'm going to cast a once heightened force barrage. So that should be 2 and 4 plus 2.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, how do you have a heightened force barrage at level 2?

[Speaker 4]
Um, from Magus, I guess? It can be cast between 1 and 3 actions.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I thought you meant like you were up casting with a higher ranked slot.

[Speaker 4]
No, no.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I corrected that, but it didn't roll right, so I guess I'll just roll it again. Alright, 6 points of damage.

[Speaker 8]
Very good. Barrage, barrage.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, and that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, what you probably had to do was click cast, and that would have expended it if that dropped it into your spell card over.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, Kibi, you going before me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, Kibi.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, um, so Kibi, go ahead, but I think there's something I can add to that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, do you want to?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, I can't. Never mind, because I used 2 actions.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Gonna attack this asshole here.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, they both pop out of existence. Oh. You see them freeze?

It's just 10 damage on either of these guys. Go ahead, send them back. Until you guys actually get to the hollow, because they can't sustain their form here, because there's no frost.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that was anti-climactic.

[Speaker 1]
For the moment.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, ominous. And, uh, the castral yells, and stay gone!

[Speaker 2]
They've taken Kibi with them.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no! No, Kibi!

[Speaker 11]
Ah, you got that kid with her cat!

[Speaker 3]
Air lifted me out of there. Oh, okay. Yay!

[Speaker 2]
That was the easiest ADXP of my life.

[Speaker 7]
Right?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Later during the day, it's gonna be at nighttime, so you're getting towards your overnight travels here. You're almost beached at this point, but they're just taking things slower because of course it's nighttime, they want to be careful.

There's yet another flapping in the distance. If you guys want to, in this time, you guys would have had time to do tree wounds and stuff like that, so that wouldn't have been difficult.

[Speaker 3]
Right, I have a... I could probably do that on myself.

[Speaker 2]
I got a couple castings of Leon hands.

[Speaker 3]
Does anybody have a higher than a 6 tree wounds? Nope, I'm the best in the party. Got it.

Three cheers for Kibi. I can be everyone's doctor today. Sorry if you get fur in the stitches.

[Speaker 2]
Bless you. It's a good thing I'm capable of healing myself, otherwise I'd be subjected to medical malpractice.

[Speaker 3]
Don't let her cook, either.

[Speaker 2]
Fortunately, I've got cooking proficiency, so we should be fine. Also, I have a Leon hands up here that's for you to grab for whoever wants it.

[Speaker 4]
I'm perfectly healthy. Same, same.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, one of those got me up to full.

[Speaker 10]
Me too. Only took 6 damage.

[Speaker 2]
If you give me 10 minutes, I can heal Kibi more.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I can wait. I have treat wounds immunity for a while, but...

[Speaker 2]
That's just to one person, no? But that doesn't make you immune to the light of my god.

[Speaker 3]
That is true, that is true. Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
And then if you give me another 10 minutes, I can do that again.

[Speaker 3]
How far are we from shore?

[Speaker 1]
About a thousand feet at this point.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Within range of bringing a dingy out there. Problem is the Fonk has rolled in again, so they're being very, very careful about this.

[Speaker 2]
I'll assume I have time then to do this one last time to get Kibi back to full.

[Speaker 3]
I will have my axe out and ready. I'm not going to be standing near the edge. I don't want to get pulled in.

[Speaker 1]
Let me have a second. This is the easiest way to go about this.

[Speaker 7]
Oh! Little boat there.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Currently concealed. Unless you guys want to do some exploration activities, anybody successfully scouts, or searches and stuff like that, that's going to spot it pretty quickly.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I'll do a scout. Done. Clear.

Scout.

[Speaker 2]
To everyone that I think we'll just stay defending. We'll just stay in the front. In the hopes that the next thing that jumps us doesn't have AOEs.

[Speaker 5]
You're all ganging up on me again, no! I'm trying to stay away from you, you people.

[Speaker 2]
That sounds... I can't protect you if you're not in my healing order, you weirdo. You short person!

No, I'm kidding. You abomination! Do you want to come over here and say that to my face, little man?

You don't look like you've got much meat on your bones. I don't think that'd work out for you.

[Speaker 5]
By the way, I was saying that out of the game, but yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm also being cheeky.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and add yourselves to an issue.

[Speaker 5]
I figured, but...

[Speaker 3]
With dwarf cooking, I'm sure you could put some meat on those bones. I think dwarves do not have to eat meat for cooking.

[Speaker 5]
They do.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I rolled higher than literally anyone. So it's already an improvement on last time.

[Speaker 3]
Kyrona is three points higher. But yes, you definitely rolled higher than me and poor Picastro.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, I said I rolled higher than literally anyone. As in I didn't roll the lowest. Did somebody leave the call?

Oh, there we go. I think they're having mic problems.

[Speaker 1]
Disconnect whatever your input device is and then put it back in. And then set it back. And then go into your voice settings and set it again.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, alright.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, there we go.

[Speaker 6]
Sick, awesome. Oh no, it still thinks I'm in. Alright, give me a second.

Would you pick the me that's there? I do not. Thanks.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I can't wait to level up.

[Speaker 6]
Just as I was doing an active search, the ghosts don't want me doing that. Apparently.

[Speaker 1]
And you'll probably have to reload.

[Speaker 6]
What happened? The wifi decided it would pull a funny so I had to switch.

[Speaker 10]
The wifi.

[Speaker 7]
Brutality.

[Speaker 6]
I'll reload again. It's still telling me that I'm in.

[Speaker 5]
Picastro can't wait until he can afford a second gun.

[Speaker 6]
As this is right. Do I still exist on the thing for you guys? What a question.

[Speaker 3]
You know what? It's like that sometimes.

[Speaker 4]
I was just commenting on the amusing philosophical question.

[Speaker 6]
You know what? You guys can continue. I'm going to restart this computer.

It's still telling me that I'm in. See you in like a minute. Just continue on.

[Speaker 2]
We will be here. Have fun.

[Speaker 6]
Thanks.

[Speaker 2]
I miss them already. So what brings you out here on the sea?

[Speaker 4]
Like man.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, you as well. Money.

[Speaker 3]
I really like money.

[Speaker 5]
She does not like it. I was going to say for Castro reached through the vomit to find money but I'm not doing that.

[Speaker 7]
There's no money in it.

[Speaker 5]
It's just fur and whatever she ate for lunch. Not Mr. Crab. He hasn't hit that level yet.

He hasn't gone full money, money, money.

[Speaker 2]
Hey Lassiter, are you sure you don't need a lie down? You're kind of emptying yourself all over the deck. I'm catching more than one of the sailors giving you some mad stink eye right now.

[Speaker 4]
It's okay Kibi.

[Speaker 7]
Kibi does not like it. I know.

[Speaker 2]
I can't say I'm particularly fond of being up here on the water either. You ever tried hitting someone with a hammer from across a boat? What made you ask?

All I'm saying is that I'm not trained for ship combat.

[Speaker 4]
Kirona's going to cast dry moisture. Draw moisture to wash Kibi's vomit off the deck.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to go check to see if I can find a mop in the bucket.

[Speaker 4]
Hey James. So the cantrip timber creates a small dead tree. Could I use it to create a small bush of catnip instead?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so. Not unless it's falling on Kibi. And a large log of catnip.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. That doesn't sound like a good idea.

[Speaker 2]
Catnip?

[Speaker 3]
Would that be like pesh? Would that technically be pesh for Kibi? Something like that.

[Speaker 2]
But now I've only seen catnip depicted, that sounds like slamming a brick of cocaine over someone's head. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Hey! Try and have a good time!

[Speaker 4]
Alright. What are we waiting for at the moment?

[Speaker 1]
I'm sort of waiting for Heart. But Heart is... I mean, Heart has a rule.

So, at some point, Heart will be back.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Heart's just currently fighting the digital demons.

[Speaker 4]
Ah.

[Speaker 2]
We wish them luck on this endeavor.

[Speaker 4]
Godspeed.

[Speaker 2]
There are a lot of things rolling in this show right now. And they're rolling pretty high.

[Speaker 7]
Oh no. Hey, there they are. Welcome back!

[Speaker 12]
Are you back in?

[Speaker 9]
Hello!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, there we go. Hello.

[Speaker 12]
Oh yeah, just use your refri cow.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. That's what I'm hopping in with now. Since, um...

Seems there is poor connection.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway. Heart, jump in there. Add your character to initiative.

[Speaker 9]
Are you alright?

[Speaker 1]
He's gonna do. He's just command. Oh yeah.

To move twice.

[Speaker 6]
Initiative, initiative.

[Speaker 1]
Eh, they'll be giving priority on you guys. This ship is turning the water below into ice and it's... The sails are arranged on the side.

It's flying.

[Speaker 7]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
Do not crash into us. Sick. We do not want a Titanic.

[Speaker 1]
It's literally just a problem with the world. It's been a problem with Boundary for fucking forever. That they're never going to fix.

[Speaker 5]
What's the problem with Boundary?

[Speaker 12]
Don't worry about it. It'll come.

[Speaker 1]
It's not gonna fix until the world refreshes or the connection changes.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that hits.

[Speaker 1]
Got an attack versus Corona. Damage there. We're aiming at Helgen.

[Speaker 8]
Misses. Wow.

[Speaker 2]
That's the power of a champion with a shield. There's no wall of iron.

[Speaker 10]
More accurately, a wall of steel.

[Speaker 5]
Eh, whatever. Wouldn't it be more like wood? Wood and steel.

What? Oh, he said more accurately steel when he was referring to his...

[Speaker 1]
I have a steel shield. Alright, and he's gonna hunker down. Let's see.

Get some lesser cover there. Dude. Second fellow up.

Gunfire on Minaya.

[Speaker 4]
Ow.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he's doing it.

[Speaker 6]
Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
Centuries Aim.

[Speaker 12]
Holy cats.

[Speaker 2]
What do these centuries look like? Are they just like four goobers on a boat?

[Speaker 1]
They have black and blue armor that's not terribly metallic or anything like that. Looks like it's partially made of bodies, partially made of wood. Oh.

Neat. Not mass manufactured. Oh, it's high creep.

And the last one's gonna fire on Kibi.

[Speaker 7]
Hey. That's not nice. Ow.

Okay. Oh. Pathetic.

[Speaker 8]
And we use Centuries Aim.

[Speaker 1]
Miss. That's their turn now. If anybody wants to pull them closer, you could use a ballista.

One of the ballistas. On the rear of the ship. Alright, so there we go.

Paranoid.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that is a very interesting option. Um. So, yes.

I'm going to use one of the ballistas here. Um. One second to decide between what spell strikes I want to use.

Yeah, I'll do I guess I There we go. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Who are you firing at?

[Speaker 4]
Um. Should I aim at the Centuries or the boat, do you think?

[Speaker 2]
I think the boat, because if you can drag the boat in, then the melees can actually engage.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'll do that then. Um.

[Speaker 1]
Are you firing on? Oh, okay, you're using the Okay.

[Speaker 4]
So what do I roll for the ballista?

[Speaker 1]
I'll just roll with Oberon's Wreath, honestly.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um. If I'm using Oberon's Wreath, can I add Force Barrage?

[Speaker 1]
Force Barrage, is that a separate spell, or is that It is a separate spell, but um.

[Speaker 4]
Shooting Star is it's kind of something that adds onto the range strike. And Oberon's Wreath turns spells into ranged strikes.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, excellent.

[Speaker 1]
Target one of these guys, or Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I'm clicking cast and it's not casting.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, it made it into the So when you click cast on here, it'll just pop into the chat window, so Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Don't I have to make an attack roll? Nope, Force Barrage automatically hits.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 8]
And for that, just roll damage.

[Speaker 13]
Here we go.

[Speaker 4]
Ignore that it's acid. It should be not. Of course.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 13]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
That hits, and it's gonna pull these guys closer.

[Speaker 4]
And then you said that Shooting Star was supposed to add onto Yes, so the Shooting Star is added to a ranged attack, and the Wreath changes spells into ranged attacks. Okay. So it ignores the target's concealment, and reduces their cover by one degree.

Oh, for this strike only. Um, if the strike hits, which it did, Meteor Trail gives the benefits of concealment, negation, and cover reduction until the start of my next turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, but that's good, because this guy had lesser cover.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. These guys Not that guy again. Um, Um, is he still frightened of me?

[Speaker 1]
The Repertory key, yes, but he's not actually going, so I Okay. Right now he's mounted. If his mount got killed, or sorry, if his rider got killed, which is gonna happen here, then he would get messed up, or he would have his own initiative at that point.

But while he's mounted, he shares initiative and actions with the other guy.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm. There we go.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm. Yep, I'm just checking some 15, that's 20, that's 25.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's hilarious, I can just do that. I'm gonna use Defensive Advance, pull it up for reference. This lets me raise my shield, move, and strike if I end my movement within range of an enemy.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, you can just click and drag your character, and it'll show you the Oh, what? I misremembered. You have to click at the very top, token controls, and then select tokens.

So where are you trying to go?

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying to go here, I realize I need to use I realize I need to use two move actions to get here, so I'll just move, and then I'll Defensive Advance. Okay. So which one?

And then I'll target this guy.

[Speaker 8]
Hits.

[Speaker 1]
Take away that lesser cover, he doesn't have the benefit of that anymore. Is that the end of your turn? Yep.

[Speaker 2]
That is the end of my turn, yes. That's all three actions. Three.

[Speaker 1]
Then move back one.

[Speaker 8]
Less effective. That's right, anyways.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I was gonna shield block. Okay.

[Speaker 12]
Go ahead and pop it.

[Speaker 2]
I press the block button and just take damage. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
What? What? Is this gonna be the wet food?

I'll give it to him soon. You're fine, I'll give it to him. That's his turn.

Mediah. Ambusher.

[Speaker 6]
Huzzah. Alright. Targeting, targeting.

Oh, you know what would be very funny if it works? I can't get all of them, they're strategically placed, that's a shame. But I can get most of them.

I can get three of them. Please make a will save. You're fine.

It's just the enemies.

[Speaker 4]
Before we get to the end of the round, would anybody be willing to donate two actions to load the ballista? Because it deals...

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I can get the bird to do that.

[Speaker 4]
It does 4d12 piercing. Oh my god.

[Speaker 6]
Sure, I'll actually... That's probably more useful than what I was doing then. Sure, why not.

I'll load the ballista instead. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Are we? Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Most welcome. Anyway. Um...

Let's see. I'll cast this instead. Since I have one action left.

And because you are in the front lines, please take this.

[Speaker 10]
Ooh.

[Speaker 6]
And this.

[Speaker 10]
Fun.

[Speaker 6]
And that would be the end of my turn. Oopsie daisy. Please end my turn for me.

I need to get this thing to...

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you're on your ref account, you have access to the turn tracker.

[Speaker 6]
That is true, but... Ah, you got it. It's key.

Alright.

[Speaker 7]
Um... Oh, I never raged. What the fuck?

Okay. Um... Ooh.

I don't know if I want to get onto the ship that they're going to be on, because they might be sinking it.

[Speaker 3]
So I think I'm going to expend an action to draw a javelin. And then I'm going to throw said javelin.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. And that was... Yeah?

[Speaker 3]
One more. It's... Right in the face.

It's it for Kibi's turn.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'm going to move uh... 35 feet.

And I'm going to shoot the shit out of one of these guys. Uh... I choose that one.

And then... Uh... 23.

7. And then I reload. And then I reload, and that will be the end of my turn.

Yeah, that's good. Oh, I had a question.

[Speaker 2]
What's up? I noticed that the crit on that javelin rolled 2d6 instead of rolling uh... 1d6 plus the amount and then doubling it.

Are we doing crits differently in this setup? I just use whatever the foundry default is for that. Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Just wanted to check. Have this guy... Move.

Oh! Let's have him use this. He gets to go all the way around.

[Speaker 4]
Please remember that nobody is getting the effect of uh... cover or concealment.

[Speaker 9]
Not on the ship.

[Speaker 8]
These guys are going to lose concealment coming out of the fog anyways.

[Speaker 1]
And do some caustic mucus. I get everyone. No.

[Speaker 8]
Let's just use that one.

[Speaker 7]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 13]
Uh-oh boy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh man. Oh, reflex save first.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, nice, Minaya. There's a little...

[Speaker 1]
Go to the chat window. There's a little... Yeah, there you go.

Forkastra succeeds. Frogan fails. Frogan fails.

Hikaru...

[Speaker 2]
Hikaru was so wrapped up fighting these guys that she did not even see that coming.

[Speaker 1]
Hikaru doesn't take any damage. They... Crit succeeded.

I just... Minaya.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, they did.

[Speaker 1]
Well, Forkastra takes half. That is... All of them.

Beautiful. That's his turn.

[Speaker 4]
Does the attack have the earth, fire, metal, plant, water, or wood trait?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's got acid and primal.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Because unless I can find a reaction to save myself, Kyrena's gonna be down. And I don't have one.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you do have one.

[Speaker 4]
I do? Ah, thank you. Equal to level and ability modifier so that's intelligent.

So I know... Awesome. Alright, so I am at 5 HP.

Oh no, the temporary hit points are 5.

[Speaker 12]
Right. There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so are you taking over or am I roleplaying Oberon?

[Speaker 1]
We'll go over that in a moment.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, where was your initiative beforehand? You were...

[Speaker 4]
Uh, 22.

[Speaker 1]
22, so we're gonna move you back here. There you go.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I would say, uh, in Half-Hundred-Second Edition, it sets your initiative of whoever knocked you, but you weren't effectively knocked, so... That reminds me, this guy...

[Speaker 8]
Gotta make some attacks. Miss. Rekomess.

That's rough. This fellow's going to move backwards.

[Speaker 1]
Barakibi. Barakibi again. Critically miss.

Uh, Major Scanlon, also Oberon, is looking for a great prize. So, he's turning that... He's turning that ballista around to target the drake.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
So, Kyrona usually has brown eyes. When she gets hit and comes back up, you guys see that her eyes are flat green, no white at all, and glowing a little bit. Why?

Because Oberon's in charge. It's Oberon. Oh no!

[Speaker 2]
Kroga, currently staring down three archers, doesn't notice.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so am I rolling that ballista attack?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can take the, uh...

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so it's one action to aim, and one action to launch. And I just roll a regular ranged attack?

[Speaker 1]
Roll with Oberon's read.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I say that just for the sake of getting some of the other effects there. Oh, that's not an attack.

[Speaker 13]
There you go.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Okay. That's still not an attack.

[Speaker 1]
So go to your actions on the character sheet.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, thank you. I was on the wrong tab.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think 5e did it to where everything was basically inside the inventory.

[Speaker 4]
I need regular arrows. There we go, okay. Alright, now...

Regular arrow attack. Alright. And that is going to do 4d12.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful. When you hit... Uh, when you hit damage, go ahead, right under base damage, there's an area where you can add, um...

where you can add dice.

[Speaker 13]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So you would just go right next to the d... Uh, change the d4 to a d12. Put a 4 right before it.

[Speaker 4]
But I can't remove that base damage? That's fine. Okay.

[Speaker 10]
Dimash.

[Speaker 1]
Very fucking injured. Oh, it did do it. Okay.

Okay. Then did it do the splash damage?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I turned off the splash damage.

[Speaker 1]
Why would you do that? Oh, no, that's fine. I like this one.

Oh, because it's the, um, the ballista. Alright, so these vanish.

[Speaker 4]
Um, and I still have one action. So... Um, I'm gonna use that...

Oh! Do the archers vanish?

[Speaker 1]
They do, as does the boat.

[Speaker 4]
Ah.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Basically, they're popping... Think of these guys as, like, dimensional raiders. They're coming out to fuck with you guys, and if they get popped back, then...

makes it a little bit more difficult for them.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, go! I imagine having one foot on, like, the railing of this ship, and one foot on the railing of the other ship. Uh, just, like, grabs the railing before she falls into the water.

[Speaker 7]
Kibi! Oh, yay.

[Speaker 2]
Good for you.

[Speaker 4]
Who yelled Kibi? Did Kibi just yell Kibi like a Pokemon?

[Speaker 7]
Yes, that is now canon. This is exactly what happened. Oh my god, I get to level up?

[Speaker 5]
If we have one more encounter like this, I will also level up.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Should I put one into Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma? You know what, we'll do Charisma for, like, intimidation and stuff like that.

We don't need Wisdom or Intelligence. Intelligence. I get Brutality?

What does Brutality do?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't even get a notice for Kibi leveling up.

[Speaker 7]
Hirona is now level three. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
I just gotta get back on the ship. She's, like, got her hammer hooked around the Kibi will lift you up. Okay, you're very strong.

Alright, now put me down.

[Speaker 3]
She will do so. Kibi. Kibi, Kibi, Kibi.

[Speaker 2]
I heard a tale of these dimensional fuckers, but I had no idea they boost out Aerotechn about it.

[Speaker 6]
Well, they're defeated, we are not dead, all is well.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, now if you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second to heal myself.

[Speaker 7]
We can do Expert there. No, we're not gonna do Expert there, we're gonna do Trained, and...

[Speaker 1]
I changed the arrows in your inventory to read as Oberon's arrows, and I turned off the checkbox that says Destroy on Use.

[Speaker 4]
Perfect, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
That way you can have the arrows without. I was like, oh, I'll just add, like, a thousand of them, and then it, like, increased the bulk. I was like, wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh, Fakestra, I was gonna say, if you give me, like, uh, like, ten, like, ten minutes, I can use Lay on Hands again. I can just... pass those around.

Plus, also, Kibi's got, uh, medicine, just to save up on potions.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I like this song.

[Speaker 6]
I just suppose that was a saves up in spell slots.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this Dwarf Fortress music?

[Speaker 1]
It is.

[Speaker 2]
This is excellent. Oh, I hear it. The songs of my homeland.

Hee hee hee hee.

[Speaker 4]
Excellent. Reveal true name, which means I can now...

[Speaker 2]
So, like, every ten minutes, I have one of those to throw around.

[Speaker 9]
I can now use true names against people.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what skill to improve. Uh, should I do athletics, intimidation, nature, survival, or medicine?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, what's your... What's your archetype, out of curiosity?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, my dedication, or just my archetype itself? Uh, cause I'm a... I'm a giant's instinct, uh, barbarian, but my dedication is a mauler.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'd say athletics will probably do you a lot of good, especially with stuff like slam down.

[Speaker 4]
Um, can I get some healing also? Actually, what you guys actually hear is Kyrona just kind of turns towards the group without making any kind of unnecessary movements, and in a completely different voice, says this vessel requires healing.

[Speaker 3]
Duh!

[Speaker 2]
My, you're different from the last time I laid eyes on you.

[Speaker 3]
What happened to your eyes?

[Speaker 2]
Are you like an elf or something?

[Speaker 4]
I am far more than you would ever understand, little blonde.

[Speaker 2]
Apologies, I couldn't hear you over the guitars.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I am far more than you would ever understand, little blonde.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so you're a potentious! Alright, well, you still need healing, so get over here.

[Speaker 3]
Also, I healed you, Karelga.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you! I was only two below max, so it's still nice. Well, every ten minutes I'm just gonna cast, uh, this again, so if enough time passes that I can get someone back up to full, then that'll be good.

[Speaker 4]
So the effect on Kyrona ends after a minute, so probably before you cast Lay on Hands, and she just kind of sits down very abruptly and looks kind of nauseous, very unhappy.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh, damn. Oh, miss, you got all- you should like- Oh, never mind, the cats already healed you.

[Speaker 3]
I didn't think I'd heal that much, I was, like, expecting, like, maybe seven.

[Speaker 4]
Thanks, Kipi.

[Speaker 3]
Did we have to steal your thunder there, Miss Frelga?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, don't worry, the healing's not really my thunder, I'm doing, like, six health a cast. This is just for- Yeah, this is just for getting around the hour-long immunities on your healing.

[Speaker 6]
I'm just a little bit scripted, but not enough for a proper medical check.

[Speaker 1]
Just briefly, I want to ask you guys, when are you folks next available to play? I do have to go to work tomorrow.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I'm- I'm available Wednesday and Tuesday.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'm available any day of the week, so Wednesday or Saturday.

[Speaker 2]
Tuesday and Wednesday work well- Tuesday and Wednesday work well for me.

[Speaker 3]
You know, I'm always- I'm always available. So, Tuesday.

[Speaker 1]
I think Tuesday would be perfect, because you guys took two days to travel, so you'll be in time jail.

[Speaker 3]
So the 30th?

[Speaker 1]
It looks like it, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
And then we get to actually do the dungeon itself. These guys will go on the assault.

[Speaker 5]
I can go to sleep now.

[Speaker 1]
They make up their magic items, and more importantly, I can fix Oberon's wreath to talk about the spell shot stuff. It'll be good.

[Speaker 2]
And hopefully by- And hopefully the next time I'm playing, like, a different campaign, I'll be able to actually play Agar.D and- We are planning to- So, I am planning to switch to V13.

[Speaker 1]
If the simple calendar- If the simple calendar edit- Apparently somebody did make a edit to the simple calendar module that works for V13. I'm gonna see if that either gets merged with the module, or if it just works.

[Speaker 5]
Why wouldn't it work?

[Speaker 1]
There's a billion reasons why it might not work. I'm grateful to Foundry in a lot of ways. I also despise the people who make it in a lot of ways for a lot of reasons.

[Speaker 5]
They keep fucking- It's still better than rule 20.

[Speaker 1]
That's an extremely low bar, and I assure you, rule 20- I know the people that made rule 20. Rule 20 sucks so bad because they probably looked at paint, like Microsoft Paint and ScreenShare, and said it's better than that.

[Speaker 5]
The guys made it are dicks, so I can't really.

[Speaker 1]
I remember asking them on Foundry, like, why wasn't DragRuler part of, like, you know, core functionality? To begin with, it's like, well, not everybody needs to know movement when they're running combat. I run- We do things where we don't use movement all the time, and we never use the DragRuler.

It's like- But for people who do- If you're running a system that has combat that uses movement, maybe you guys do everything, theater of the mind, but the point of the VTT, the function of the VTT, is that you move people around on there during a combat. That's why we have things like grid. So if you're gonna support the grid, then I should be able to- Well, you could just count the squares.

It's like, why have a ruler in it to begin with? Why even give me the ability to measure it separately? You mean to tell me this thing is not default?

[Speaker 12]
You mean to tell me this is an add-on?

[Speaker 1]
Not until, like, version 12, I think, was the DragRuler implemented. It used to be a module, which is totally fucking insane.

[Speaker 2]
That's insane. Because that was the default on Roll20 for the entire time I was using that fucking thing.

[Speaker 1]
Imagine, you would have to, like, go here, and you would have to use this. It's not always super obvious, like, well, I can measure out to here, but those are a bunch of, like, relatively similar textures, so if I start moving Kibbe up there, I might be, like, here, here. If I'm counting individually on the screen, the whole point is for me to not count individually on the screen.

Before I started coding my own shit.

[Speaker 4]
Can you help me figure out downtime? Or is that gonna take too long for right now?

[Speaker 1]
It's not gonna take so... I'm not gonna do it right this second. I will probably message you, so I'll have some admin time at the shop, at work.

Okay. I'll go back and forth. We have a new bot for downtime that actually displays them on the...

on my website. My website's back up, too.

[Speaker 5]
You do D&D stuff at your work? How did you finagle that with your boss?

[Speaker 1]
No, I just message people while I'm doing other stuff, as well. That makes sense.

[Speaker 5]
My boss would crucify me.

[Speaker 1]
You have different jobs. I have a history of bullying my boss for stuff like this.

[Speaker 3]
Is this a... Okay, so that's a... Action.

Okay, where would I go? The session's over. Okay, we're not gonna do that.

Never mind. Alrighty!

[Speaker 5]
Oh, were you doing something?

[Speaker 7]
No, no, I wasn't.

[Speaker 5]
Is the session over, James?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so the session will be over when I come back on... We'll come back on Tuesday, and that'll be perfect, because you guys spent two days traveling.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, cool. Well, then, peace, everybody. Have a good rest of your night, day, or...

Whatever. Day. Year.

Yeah. Okay, bye.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, just one last thing before I get going. I just wanted to check. Will we be able to update my token by then?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Supposedly, there's an issue where I think regular players are not able to add their own art.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I can log into my referee account and do that for you, then.

[Speaker 2]
I have a reference image in my character page.

[Speaker 11]
Like, on Discord. I'm gonna try and draw something for her at some point, but I'm still working on doing that.

[Speaker 1]
Use file browser. So I think that this is probably fine. I've said this to regular players can use the file browser.

I don't think that they're actually able to delete anything.

[Speaker 9]
I'm pretty sure they're not able to delete anything. So... Um...

Hmm. Let me log out here. Log into my account.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I have a headache, and I have an early morning, so I'm going to head out. It was nice meeting you, Silver.

[Speaker 2]
Nice meeting you, too! I wish you the best. I wish you a good night.

[Speaker 12]
Thank you for...Silver, you were great. Skoder, heart, all great. Bar, thank you for coming back.

[Speaker 4]
I had much more fun. Good!

[Speaker 9]
I was hoping it was just a class problem.

[Speaker 2]
What was the class last time that they were having problems with?

[Speaker 4]
I went from 5E Warlock to Witch.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Very much not what I wanted.

[Speaker 12]
Oof.

[Speaker 2]
I could play Warlock for Pathfinder's second edition. Magus is the closest you'll get in PF2E at the moment.

[Speaker 9]
Um, so... What should I call you? Silver?

[Speaker 2]
Silver works, Anna works, I generally go by Silver.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so where do you have your character image uploaded?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, you know the character creation and campaign info?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right, in Discord. I was looking on Pathfinder, and I was like, I can't find it!

[Speaker 2]
Did I do that? It's under Lord Silver's characters, it's the last image.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, there we go. Very cute.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you! Yeah, no, I... There was like a different image that I used to use for her when I first came up with the character, like, years ago.

But I cannot find that image now.

[Speaker 11]
But I think that works, it's just she's not using the maul, she's using the Warhammer.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm looking forward to looking forward to Tuesday.

[Speaker 9]
There you go, all fixed.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Nice meeting all y'all, great playing with y'all. Y'all have a good night!

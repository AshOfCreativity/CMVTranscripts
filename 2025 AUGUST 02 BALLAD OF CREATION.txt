[Speaker 4]
Mik did the finish line. There's also Heroforge.

[Speaker 2]
There's also Heroforge and I got a lot of... Yeah, there's ArtStation, Heroforge, DeviantArt, kinda. If you want to take the time...

[Speaker 18]
I would never risk DeviantArt, but that's just because I know it's on there now.

[Speaker 2]
If you want to take the time, DeviantArt, or if you have all the time in the world, Pinterest.

[Speaker 4]
But you gotta know what you're looking for. He's a fighter, so he's got a sword, or does it matter what weapon? Like, plate armor, has shield.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, a shield. This guy doesn't have a shield. But his arm looks like one.

[Speaker 14]
Ooh. Okay, well I'm just gonna get distracted.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Otter and I went down a bunny trail, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna just casually send this one over to Nessie.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Oh. We should just have a channel for sharing cool art.

Yeah. Possible.

[Speaker 16]
There already is a channel.

[Speaker 4]
That's art to make.

[Speaker 17]
Art design.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, but you commissioned it. Close enough. Yeah.

Yeah. This feels hyper-specific. I think I'm missing the reference.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, god, that guy sucked.

[Speaker 16]
He did.

[Speaker 1]
He... had very bad faith arguments against Pathfinder 2, and it pissed me off. He...

You can tell he got all of his opinions on the tabletop 4chan board, you know? He just... Hmm.

Oh, they have wheelchairs in Pathfinder? That's so stupid, I hate that game, huh? Hey, James, come and homebrew OSR Shadows of the Demon Lord for me, because that's cool, right?

[Speaker 13]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
I was about to ask you what a Ray-Ban was.

[Speaker 21]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 1]
We have three characters in the party folder we are still missing.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, shit, sorry. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, there should be an arrow? He is now. I was watching.

Can't trick me. There's Jacob.

[Speaker 11]
Should I gamble or not? Should I join? Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Who's Jacob? Uh, pro-skeleton. Oh.

Belonging to, not his, like, rank.

[Speaker 2]
No, you need to name it, like, a play on words. That's not allowed.

[Speaker 23]
What do you mean? What's wrong with Jacob?

[Speaker 2]
Like, Bones McCoy. What were the other ones?

[Speaker 6]
Hey, he was once a person, and he demands his respect.

[Speaker 2]
It's not Jacob Bones, though, it's just Jacob. No, it's not. It means nothing.

What do you have against J-Names? I have nothing wrong with J-Names. Actually, that's not true.

My mother's name starts with a J, therefore I hate J-Names. There we go, I did it.

[Speaker 5]
Nope, nope, she's Julie. Let's see, we had Indiana Bones, McCully Skulkin, Bones McCoy.

[Speaker 1]
Man, I'm catching strays here just by having a J-Name, Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 5]
God, I don't remember what the lady's name was.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
I don't even remember who she was themed after.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
Because that one was a really weird one. Is she in my foundry still? Where are you, ma'am?

[Speaker 7]
How about Bone Joby?

[Speaker 2]
There you go.

[Speaker 7]
That's pretty good.

[Speaker 2]
That's acceptable.

[Speaker 3]
Boney? As in, spelled like Bonnie.

[Speaker 7]
Barney Scott. Sherlock Bones?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 9]
I'm one of the skeletons with the highest intelligence in the group.

[Speaker 2]
Your skeleton has the highest intelligence in the group? Does it? It's not gonna be bad.

I'm sure it'll be fine.

[Speaker 3]
Mr. Ribble, are you coming along on this journey, or you don't want to risk your character?

[Speaker 7]
I could. How many revives do I get? Depends how badly you die.

[Speaker 9]
There you go, mixing the list. What's the worst that could happen?

[Speaker 3]
You could die?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, true, true. I'll play Kineticist. I mean, if you stay in...

Hey, I don't want all of the... What's in that box? What?

Okay, I don't want Legos outside on the deck, please.

[Speaker 7]
Legolord's strong with this one.

[Speaker 6]
What did you do to Jacob? Is he gonna backstroy?

[Speaker 2]
No, why are we doing this? We're throwing all our popkins through the stupid doggy door into the house.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, Mikael's safe now. He's surrounded by protection.

[Speaker 3]
Some of you might want to rest your characters. They're injured, near death, injured.

[Speaker 2]
Whoa, who's near death? Oh, me. You!

It's me! Who's dead, said the person bloody as hell.

[Speaker 10]
Wow, you're like messed up.

[Speaker 2]
I have four hit points left. Wow. I don't remember what she did last, but she got so fucked up.

[Speaker 3]
Remember when we went into the hollow underneath the church and you got all those effects? That's what happened.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, there was suddenly a race between you and I over who had the most effects. Uh-huh. You won!

Woo!

[Speaker 3]
I went down several times because it was Vampire Fairies.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, and they had the knife.

[Speaker 3]
I am so glad that did not happen. But it was funny the amount of times I was going down.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I remember now.

[Speaker 1]
James acting like he really wanted it to happen when he gave out a hero point to stop it happening. Shaking my head. Should've given it to me, Nova can always use hero points out of combat.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, we are so very grateful you gave that hero point at the hour when it was supposed to occur. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Ah! Okay, so we're going to need everybody to go to their token prototype, whatever it's called. Prototype token.

And make sure that we can see your health. So resources, hovered by everyone.

[Speaker 1]
I think just having the health state's fine.

[Speaker 2]
If you want the healer to do her job, make sure that your health can be hovered by everyone.

[Speaker 1]
While you were looking at your characters, I would appreciate if your character was holding any weapons or things that they would normally be holding. Because I am a prick about that stuff. Also, James, I noticed McCannon has a potency rune in the striking room in his inventory.

I think you talked about putting it on a weapon, I can't remember what you put it on. Put it on something now or I'm going to get cranky.

[Speaker 3]
You can just...

[Speaker 11]
So where's this display thing?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's just a little semantic with the potency runes and stuff. You go into your sheet. You go to the very top where it says prototype token.

You click on it. You click resources. You see the display bar where it says hovered by owner.

You click that and say hovered by anyone.

[Speaker 4]
I just have token, I don't have the prototype thing.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like, that's what confused me. That's when you use the token on the sheet. Oh yeah, if you don't have that.

Next page.

[Speaker 4]
You right click and then you go into settings. Ooh, and you can add other bars to it. That's cool.

[Speaker 1]
That's my give-a-fuck bar. You can see it's empty.

[Speaker 4]
I think it worked. I think the bar helps a little bit more. Ah, everybody's within my aura.

Means I can't have snacks. You named your weapon police mortality? It slipped my mind, clearly.

It basically has a bunch of pennies in a sock, got it. Have you met my forget-me-stick?

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, we're good. Everyone got their weapons equipped so I can't be like, you don't have a weapon equipped, dipshit, draw it. We're good?

[Speaker 4]
Everyone happy?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you're not going to be happy for long, sorry. The group of you meet with Julia Dubois' publisher in Bronlock. They have asked you to do a wellness check on her.

Her staff haven't been into town in the recent weeks. You ask about town a little bit, and some of the rangers from the area say that a veil has descended over her mansion. So you start heading out there with caution.

Before you get to the scene that you currently see, you actually come across two pieces of paper. I am going to drag them into Common and Paras' inventories. I think I've done this correctly.

[Speaker 4]
There's Paras. They should have a description.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess they're worth one silver, sure. They're just sitting on the ground, and you each pick them up. Common finds hers first, a little bit later, Para finds hers.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, do I read this out loud? If you want. Okay.

We have to read? Oh dear.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, well, I will read out the script as he put it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh dear. Do you see those lights in the distance? What was that, sorry?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, I was commenting in character because we can see their eyes glinting, right?

[Speaker 12]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, so I'm just like, hmm, do you see those lights in the distance? It doesn't, hmm, bodes ominously.

[Speaker 1]
How you doing, James? We got you here.

[Speaker 11]
Yep. Yes, the tin can stream is working just fine.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to roll initiative for McCannon as we have entered a combat, and you can tell me what you want to do when it gets to your turn. There's a hot second before then.

[Speaker 2]
We also tied each other, no.

[Speaker 4]
We're tied two over, so we can't lose each other. Because everything started going dark. It's one of those dark days, it doesn't go dark.

[Speaker 1]
Para, it's your turn. You see four beasts wraithed in shadows surrounding the party. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 14]
For now, I'm going to activate my draconic barrage, which I think just puts the little floaty guys around me.

[Speaker 5]
Excuse me. But I don't think I can do anything with that just yet, so that is that, and then I will shield myself.

[Speaker 1]
You can sustain it the turn you cast it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, can you? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
So there are some spells, like Bless, where you can't, but this one doesn't state that, so you can. Are you going to shield still?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I think I'm going to still shield.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Whoops, I just skipped his turn. And me.

I forget. This is awful, because my players will not end their turn, but they'll take damage. Here, it's the opposite.

People end their turn, but they don't take damage. So, um... Okay, it's the one at the back's turn.

[Speaker 2]
He, uh... I'm so used to that big automatic.

[Speaker 1]
He takes an action to stride. I'll go for Jacob. We're not going to kill the goblin in the first encounter.

[Speaker 16]
Ah!

[Speaker 1]
First hit, crit.

[Speaker 12]
Hit Jacob with, uh... A bite.

[Speaker 1]
What is Jacob? Does he get any, like, skeleton resistances or anything?

[Speaker 6]
He's not that cool yet.

[Speaker 1]
I see. Uh, that's its turn. We move to Vo.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to give Jacob two turns. He's going to go up and he's going to do a little... Strikey strikey.

Miss. He took a bite. Also missing.

Ah. And then I'm going to do some trauma. On this guy.

[Speaker 2]
Love a good trauma.

[Speaker 4]
Oops.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to need you to do that save instead of me.

[Speaker 1]
That's his save. Ah.

[Speaker 20]
So he takes a half.

[Speaker 1]
I see that the shadows protect him as he resists that ability. Oh no, he doesn't. Magic damage.

Ah. Heh. These guys aren't that cool.

Alright, I believe that is your turn. Yep. Come on.

[Speaker 3]
Hello! We're going to do, you know, the fan favorite. We are throwing in lingering composition.

Eh.

[Speaker 15]
Oof. I feel inspired.

[Speaker 3]
Hehe. And then, we will... We'll yell at the dog, why not?

Eh, no, we'll keep that for later. Let's dart the guy first to see if... ...if it is that, you know, strong version. And... sorry, friend. It's damage.

We're done, and that will be the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, sorry. Ah, fuck. Sorry!

[Speaker 16]
Sorry. No, no. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to say you're all holding onto the rope because it's a logistical nightmare of tracking how far you can get between each other.

[Speaker 16]
Uh...

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. We don't really know.

[Speaker 15]
He's durable. Ish.

[Speaker 21]
No. No. It's lagging in the second.

[Speaker 4]
He's a tasty man, Alfred.

[Speaker 3]
He lives there instead, so I can't mess around.

[Speaker 1]
That's rough, buddy.

[Speaker 16]
Uh-huh. You like that, huh? Is that nice?

[Speaker 2]
My new ring lets me throw my daggers, right? I wasn't done!

[Speaker 1]
I know, sorry. Your ring... You need to be holding them both to have your benefits applied to both the doubling rings.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So I can't throw them and get them back? They're not returning?

[Speaker 1]
No, but... You have a returning... It's for dual-wielding.

[Speaker 16]
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

[Speaker 1]
It's not for throwing, you would need... What a cook.

[Speaker 2]
Now it's my turn, I'll let you do it.

[Speaker 12]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
First stride gets him to here. Can't flank.

[Speaker 15]
He's going for power-up.

[Speaker 1]
This is... This guy's going for Mimosa. One stride, he gets two attacks.

[Speaker 12]
Nice. Get.

[Speaker 1]
And? You can get a... Very nice!

Don't take that damage, you just beat it. Very good. Last one will spend two actions getting counter-attacked.

Attack. Rage quit, geez. Cannon, it's now your turn.

James is muted. I see his mouth moving, but I hear nothing.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe he's just doing that. Maybe he's just moving his mouth. Just to mess with us.

[Speaker 1]
He looks like he's in on the joke, but we still can't hear him. You're muted on Discord, Bart. That wasn't scripted, but you can have a hero point, because that gave me a good laugh.

What are you whispering, Foundry? Slash W. Um, you would have an investigation.

True! Okay. Um, where are we at?

Meek. Lucky Lost. Feeling a bit out of your depth, but you're alive, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 7]
So, no one quite knows what these things are, because no one did a lore check.

[Speaker 21]
No. I think we did.

[Speaker 2]
How is it that's not gonna be smart enough to do that?

[Speaker 15]
Alright, I will try to...

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 15]
Fireblast the one next to me.

[Speaker 2]
You are more than welcome to.

[Speaker 7]
That sounds good. That would be...

[Speaker 1]
That's some kind of dog. I think that dog's a dwarf. You've definitely seen dogs before.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, he did not go well.

[Speaker 15]
Alright, let's see. I'd imagine trying to turn into a cowhound, if you tried to smash it with a fire.

[Speaker 1]
I have a hero point, that made me laugh as well.

[Speaker 15]
Oh no, should I try rerolling then?

[Speaker 1]
You want to waste a hero point on an attack, sure. Nah, it's not wasting. Attacks are good uses of hero points.

[Speaker 5]
If you can actually hit.

[Speaker 1]
I have a level one. Maybe anything you use it on is a waste, honestly.

[Speaker 7]
Not having it. Did it include the plus one? From Anthem?

Yep. Oh, okay, it did. Had to explain that.

Yep, he's done. Okay. You move back to Para.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Para is going to activate her halo.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. You become doomed one, but it's okay. I know that sounds bad, but it's okay.

What's your spell save?

[Speaker 22]
My spell save is a 21.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, fail. Fail. They fucking hate the light, I couldn't think of the word I wanted.

This guy, grit fail, I think, on an 11 is stun free. Stun two. Stun two.

And stun one as they violently react to the light. It is now the guy's turn who has stunned three. Oh, sorry.

Whoops, that wasn't your whole turn. My bad.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, one action.

[Speaker 1]
Getting carried away.

[Speaker 5]
Unless it takes more than one action to activate because it's more difficult.

[Speaker 1]
This one. This one. It just makes you doomed one.

[Speaker 5]
Then I'm going to needle darts. I'm going to use silver. Damn, is that actually what it is?

What? What? 5d4?

[Speaker 20]
Are you level five?

[Speaker 5]
It's not by level of the character, is it?

[Speaker 1]
No, but level five, you get third level spells. 3d4 and that's heightened plus two.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it is three. Okay. I didn't realize it was 3d4 to start with.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's one of the stronger hand trips.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Why are they always unnamed?

[Speaker 1]
Ah, that is your last two actions.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Do you wish to sustain your halo? It's a three, it's three.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I will. Yes, I will sustain for now.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so they'll take that debuff again at the start of your next turn and you'll go to doomed two. Okay, that guy was stunned three, so he doesn't get to act.

[Speaker 20]
I'm going to use my staff and I'm going to body Jacob. Mm-hmm. I'm going to use my actions to predict attacks.

And Jacob's going to go, how?

[Speaker 6]
And he's going to miss horribly. And it's going to be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Come on, it is your turn.

[Speaker 17]
It is my turn.

[Speaker 3]
Courageous anthem. I am going to keep doing lingering composition until it works one of these times.

[Speaker 5]
It should work.

[Speaker 3]
Whoa, damn. It's fine, I still get the thing back, so it's alright. Then, with our two actions we have...

The dogs have strategically placed themselves in inconvenient places. We'll yell at the dogs, why not. And that will be my turn.

Do I press or are you going to?

[Speaker 1]
I'll do it, I get it. To dodging out of the way, you get a nice hit on this one. Very nice.

Pretty hurt, man.

[Speaker 13]
Ah, bad luck.

[Speaker 2]
It's all good.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I believe this next guy is stunned too. He has one action left.

He's going to keep going for power.

[Speaker 12]
Big bye.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, do you want me to apply the damage?

[Speaker 1]
You can apply your own damage. Okay. Thank you.

His turn is over. We go to the other guy who was stunned too. He is going to try and get Mimosa back for stabbing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, hang on.

[Speaker 13]
You dodging?

[Speaker 2]
I can't, let's fight 10, that's only... Oh, this isn't going to help either.

[Speaker 13]
He didn't roll a... He didn't roll a... He rolled a 19.

[Speaker 2]
It says critical hit for me.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You should dodge.

[Speaker 5]
It's a crit fight 10. Which means you can take it down out of crit.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he doesn't crit you because he dodged.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Would you like me to apply that to you? You got it.

[Speaker 2]
I got it.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent, that was his only action. We move to the guy who was only stunned once. He is going to try and get Kama.

Fight.

[Speaker 15]
Ow.

[Speaker 1]
Claw. Miss.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well, the one that did bite me I would like it to... Do a will save. Hold on, let me deal myself damage first.

Here we go. Ah, boo.

[Speaker 12]
You got that dog. I can't, it's your turn.

[Speaker 24]
Yup. Yup. Yup.

[Speaker 1]
Investigate a moment.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, dee.

[Speaker 12]
Trap man. Sneak.

[Speaker 10]
Ugh, the puppies are fast.

[Speaker 7]
Eh, he'll go after the one... Trying to eat our... Kobold.

Parrot.

[Speaker 11]
I guess stuff's interchangeable here.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, crap, he actually hit.

[Speaker 1]
How do, um... Do elemental blasts benefit from... Uh...

The hand wraps of Mighty Blows? Is that how you get striking?

[Speaker 5]
They're supposed to.

[Speaker 1]
No, they have a gate attenuator that does that.

[Speaker 5]
Is it not hand wraps of how the Mighty Blows?

[Speaker 7]
It wouldn't do me any good. By the gate attenuator you can put runes on like a weapon or hand wrap.

[Speaker 1]
Puppy takes nine. Um, it's gonna say he resisted this, but he doesn't because he's in the light. Takes an extra.

Not that much.

[Speaker 7]
I will try an experiment if it'll work. At my map, so... I'll try blasting it.

With Vitality. Three points of Vitality damage.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if it does anything. I don't know either, I'm gonna let the game tell me. Unaffected by Vitality.

[Speaker 15]
Eh, I figured they're dark creatures, they might not like the good vibe.

[Speaker 1]
He's done. Alright, we move back to Parra. You gain another level of Doomed.

You dogs all get to make your saving throw again. Uh, I guess they stayed in the light the whole time. Their saving throw is one degree worse.

So we'll go clockwise. That is a PredFail. Fail.

Fail. PredFail. Two of them have stunned three.

Another two are stunned two. There's the top one. And the last one.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, uh... Um, and then this time I am gonna turn the halo off. I will not sustain it.

Um... I will use my Draconic Barrage... ...on this guy.

[Speaker 1]
What's all the damage to this Draconic Barrage? Fail?

[Speaker 5]
Um, it's my chosen damage. So I actually have no idea. Oh, I choose!

I choose, how interesting. I'm gonna go with worse.

[Speaker 10]
Is it based on scale color?

[Speaker 5]
It's not, I just choose because I am a Cleric of Dragons. Um, I can't change the damage type, so, uh...

[Speaker 12]
Are you cooked, that guy?

[Speaker 1]
He's rockin' it on their trip, that's how you dab.

[Speaker 5]
Did he make the save?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there's a save?

[Speaker 5]
There is a save, it's a reflex save.

[Speaker 1]
I thought it was just like Magic Missile, okay, hang on. Uh, your save was 21, I think?

[Speaker 5]
Um, if you look at the damage underneath, there's like a little guy running, and it should be a dice.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yep. Forgot about that, I don't use that. He failed!

It all goes as I envisioned. I hear you cooked that guy, he gets to die stunned too. He never gets to take his stun condition away.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, um... And then I don't like this guy, so he's gonna get... Can I just sustain it two more times and just hit this guy?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I believe so. I don't think... I'm fairly certain you can.

If someone would like to prove me wrong, I would happily accept it. But uh, I also don't really care about this. Because I believe Bless states that only once on your turn when you sustain it, you get the sustain effect.

Which is my point of reference. So he gets to make the save as well.

[Speaker 24]
Jeez. I'll do it again.

[Speaker 14]
How many do I get?

[Speaker 7]
How many focus points do you get?

[Speaker 5]
It just says you get a small group of them, and they increase by one every time it's heightened. I have at least three.

[Speaker 7]
It doesn't display it in Foundry, does it?

[Speaker 16]
I'll figure it out.

[Speaker 5]
Because that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Does sustaining the spell that way just end the spell, or do you get... I think you can only sustain it once. I think reading the spell.

Because when you sustain it like that, all of them fly out and kamikaze. I'm gonna give that guy back his 10 health.

[Speaker 6]
In addition, you sustain the spell that the dragons fly off and bombard a creature within 60 feet. That creature takes 2d4 of the chosen type. Once the dragons have been mused in this way, they wink out of existence and collapse.

[Speaker 14]
Oh, okay. Okay, I see.

[Speaker 1]
You can have your action back. The spell ended after you killed this first guy.

[Speaker 14]
Okay, well I'll meal darts then.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 22]
Oh. I have a hero point.

[Speaker 21]
Hero point! Hero point! Huzzah!

[Speaker 5]
Take more damage. Okay, I gotta be right back also.

[Speaker 1]
I already ended Paras' turn, so we're good. This guy was stunned three. His turn ends.

There, it's your turn.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna do a little bite attack. As I sent Jacob to attack. This is horrible.

I'm gonna do a... A little bit more trauma. Whoops.

If you'd like to do a little save, please. He fails. Yay, sweet.

Full damage? Yep. Just full damage here.

Perfect. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 13]
Come on.

[Speaker 12]
Art may be muted. Art is muted.

[Speaker 2]
Hello. Sorry.

[Speaker 12]
Still good? What would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
We're going to do... Recast on this. This one does.

[Speaker 13]
You can do it, I believe. Holy shit!

[Speaker 3]
Huzzah! Huzzah indeed! Then I will do my second attack of...

Biting words. It hits. Damage.

Awesome. Because I don't have many one-action things, we're just going to do the third one now. Oof, miss.

[Speaker 17]
And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 4]
Goodbye, sir.

[Speaker 17]
Give me a moment.

[Speaker 12]
Yes, she's here.

[Speaker 2]
I'm here. I'm just...

[Speaker 1]
He is near death. This guy gets an action. He's going to run away.

He's just an idiot. He flees into the darkness. Yes.

Cannon.

[Speaker 7]
Bruh. Pretty good double digits win these days.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just re-roll that one.

[Speaker 12]
Bruh, what are you rolling?

[Speaker 1]
All of your good rolls are used up killing us last time. Thank you. Alright, um...

Do you have any action slots? Nice. It understands your...

Sneak!

[Speaker 7]
It's your turn. Do you speak Scooby-Doo? I wanna hear this.

Alright, let's do a...

[Speaker 9]
I think it's a save.

[Speaker 7]
And then he'll try... the blast.

[Speaker 9]
He will attempt to try the blast.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, he's out.

[Speaker 1]
At the end of your turn, they return to shadow, as this combat has gone too long. Can I get people... Meek's definitely underleveled for this.

Cannon is. The rest are not. First level, 3?

4. Okay, he's good.

[Speaker 10]
Somehow, I feel stronger. Must have been the music.

[Speaker 3]
I'm glad you're into it, huh?

[Speaker 15]
Level 3 now.

[Speaker 10]
Good level.

[Speaker 1]
When the light comes back on, you feel soothed by it. However, your doomed condition slowly goes down after the... combat.

[Speaker 5]
How slowly?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... It takes a couple minutes. Uh...

But it happens when you're in the darkness.

[Speaker 5]
Um... Who all needs healing? Uh, you and I...

Should we spend 10 minutes doing a little bit of healing? Or, um... I can just use a heal spell.

[Speaker 7]
I can give everybody 1d4 plus 1 for... Nah, I'm gonna have to wait 10 minutes. Well, it's only every 10 minutes, so...

But it's everybody, so it only takes me one action to do it. Oh, you get to pick your food! You have a seed, a fruit, vegetable, you know, what's your favorite snack?

It's like trail mix. Like, pick your poison.

[Speaker 5]
I can treat wounds on the move, right? Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Do you think it would be better to do it under the safety of this light?

[Speaker 24]
Fair.

[Speaker 1]
The lantern is close.

[Speaker 6]
Sure. I can also do some, uh... treat wounds as well.

[Speaker 8]
Uh, why did that not come with the...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it was the light.

[Speaker 8]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
How many people were you targeting with that treat wounds from Para? Oh, do I... It's one Shack, I believe.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it's only one Shack? Okay, then me and Cammon.

[Speaker 10]
Ah, one Medic.

[Speaker 5]
Because I don't think anyone else... I did it? Oh, sorry!

Your health isn't showing, so I can't actually see it.

[Speaker 2]
It's hovered by everyone. No, no, no, I did it.

[Speaker 5]
But I can't see it. Yours isn't there, unless someone is sitting on top of you. Which I think they might be.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's because I did the prototype token and not the token.

[Speaker 13]
The one thing you specified.

[Speaker 2]
I hate how you have to do both. I hate you to do both.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I can only treat up to two targets with that anyway, so...

[Speaker 6]
I can heal you while you do that. Don't worry. It happens from time to time.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, dear.

Thank you, Para. I do feel much better.

[Speaker 4]
And then mine goes away after ten minutes, so...

[Speaker 1]
When you are ready to move on, your characters move towards the mansion.

[Speaker 4]
Yay, yay, yay. Damn. Can somebody roll that for me, please?

Okay.

[Speaker 18]
I clicked on it, and it didn't come up.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
It's better than a one. I'm sorry. No, no, it's better than a one.

I rolled a one.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Alright, gang. To the...

To the spooky house.

[Speaker 18]
As you continue down the... One character who was in the middle took no damage. Imagine that.

[Speaker 1]
As you continue down the road, you see another street, lantern, or road lantern, I guess, like the one that you're currently standing under. Just beyond it, about a hundred meters away, so a couple hundred feet, there is the mansion, the manor. Standing underneath the street light is a man, and he spots you and says, Oh, hey there!

I'm glad you could make it, counselor. I was sent here to keep an eye on you. We don't want another situation like the other month, now do we?

He calls out as he starts walking towards you out of the light.

[Speaker 2]
What is he looking at? Stay there!

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, I can't speak English right now.

[Speaker 1]
He has a glance at you coming. Oh, you've got one of those pages too, counselor!

[Speaker 2]
Hang on, hang on! Six-foot rule!

[Speaker 1]
The shadows close in on him.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no! I was gonna try to ask if he looked like a nerd or not, if he looked like a nerd, then we needed to save him.

[Speaker 3]
He said the exact thing, that's why when he started stepping out of the light, I was like, no, don't do that! Ah!

[Speaker 4]
He's gone. He got eaten.

[Speaker 1]
The shadows took him whole. That was pretty close to the manuscript of a hero point, Kevin.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Oh, oh, oh. You have good writing, but, oh my god.

It still got me.

[Speaker 1]
One of the pages he was holding onto does fly out of his hand, though. Do you want to go and pick it up?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. What did Pera say? Or do we get attacked every time she looks at it?

Ask Pera what it says.

[Speaker 18]
Oh, that'd be so funny.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Pera holds her up. Mine was for earlier. Mine was 17.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's not what I want to know. I want you to read it. I want to know what it says.

It's like an actual scene. We can't skip out on Landy's hard work.

[Speaker 8]
A cold chill ran over Pera as she guided the group. An unseen presence pushed against her halo. Whatever guarded the area had a disdain for her magical light.

Eyes in the dark were kept at bay by its warmth. But to keep the light present began to cast Pera more and more. And then it went out.

To shed its light again, it would take a temporary strain on her soul. Flickering it on and off, the strain would wax and wane in the darkness. The night provided an uneasy soothing.

She knew this balance would be essential to what was laid ahead. It was when the shadows were closest that they were most vulnerable to light. Everyone, make sure you stay close.

I have a really bad feeling about this. Pera announced.

[Speaker 2]
That's amazing. Yeah, you can't just keep that to yourself.

[Speaker 1]
Who's picking up the next one?

[Speaker 4]
I'll pick it up. Unless someone else has created it. Alright.

You've got water on in the background. James is sizzling. James is the sizzler.

You've got... Is it actual bacon?

[Speaker 16]
James is playing in the shower.

[Speaker 2]
That's some aggressive bacon. Holy shit.

[Speaker 1]
I've added a manuscript page to McCannon's sheet.

[Speaker 4]
And I'm gonna ready the next scene.

[Speaker 1]
If anyone would like to take a short break and grab a drink, feel free to, but I'm good to keep going whenever everyone else is ready.

[Speaker 4]
I probably fucked you, sorry. Oh, that'd be me. That would be me.

[Speaker 17]
I would say it's also possibly a warning that at the door, there's a tripwire. Considering.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, yes, sorry. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I don't get any further and I'm literally trapped.

[Speaker 1]
Roll me a secret perception check, please. This bit's clear. You can see through the windows into the house.

There's nothing, like, right at the door or anything like that.

[Speaker 4]
No booby traps stepping up to the front door of the manor. Well, remember me. Goodness.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
She looks in before stepping in very clearly.

[Speaker 1]
I think this is dark enough, hang on.

[Speaker 4]
What? No, it's fine! Don't do this to me.

I have darkvision. Is someone giving off light?

[Speaker 18]
Oh, Ver has a light spell.

[Speaker 23]
Ver has a light spell, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, you get the doomed condition as you cast it.

[Speaker 18]
No!

[Speaker 1]
Do you sustain the spell?

[Speaker 6]
It's not a sustain spell?

[Speaker 1]
You have to keep sustaining it against the darkness, otherwise it'll extinguish. I've experienced this. I've heard that title that whole time.

Oh, have you? Oops, it's my bad. That's what the rope is for.

[Speaker 2]
That's what the rope is for. Everybody hold on to the rope. Alright.

So I don't see any traps.

[Speaker 6]
I was like, I cast it on my aeonstone before we left.

[Speaker 1]
It would have extinguished pretty early on into the trip. Any attempts to cast it would give you the doomed condition. Sustaining it like Para did would increase that.

[Speaker 2]
I look at the ground. Do I see any tripwires? I look at the walls.

Do I see any tripwire mechanisms?

[Speaker 4]
You're good. I look at the stairs.

[Speaker 2]
Do I see any tripwires on the stairs?

[Speaker 1]
You don't notice a tripwire on the stairs, but you do notice a piece of paper.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. It's my turn. I pick it up.

I pick it up. Okay, I'll add it to your sheet. I've run out of copies.

Oh wait, no, it's not clear yet. Oh wait, no, it's not clear yet. Does anybody in the group do unarmed attacks?

Nope. Not me. Nope.

And I just drop that onto my mouse's inventory. There it is. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
The darkness followed the choreography laid out to it in the manuscript, growing stronger and stronger, spreading like endless water, seeping into any space it found. But it was still bound to follow the story and chain to the dark place in the first world it came from. When the story reached the end it longed for, it would finally be free.

Oh wow.

[Speaker 4]
That's either a... That's either a promise that's good or bad. We just have to know how it ended.

Yes, I suppose. Everybody hop along. It's okay for right now, just go slow.

Look for tripwires. In this room you have a...

[Speaker 1]
It's a brazy, crakey floor. The room's brazy, the floor's crakey. The stairs lead up to the second floor.

There are doors to the sides of the room leading out.

[Speaker 4]
Do we want to search the downstairs and then the upstairs? That's usually the best way. Okie dokie.

Looking. I'm looking for trapwires. All the time.

[Speaker 16]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
She can't comically be down on the floor scuttling like a creature but she is looking.

[Speaker 4]
Do I need to roll again? That's good. Don't worry about it.

I have much worries. What about this door? That's good.

Looking for the trapwires. What?

[Speaker 3]
Would a torch have the same effect as casting a spell? Would it also make that person doomed? Or because it's not magic it will just get eaten?

[Speaker 4]
Would you like to test it?

[Speaker 3]
I would if I remembered to bring torches, which I didn't. I am just...

[Speaker 2]
I think I have torches, I can check it out.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, can I even see? I think Meat can make them. No!

Oh. Cannon has darkvision. Who?

Is there someone who doesn't have darkvision?

[Speaker 3]
I have low light vision.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I believe Kineticist Flame is not magical. It... So, I'll step back.

So the light produced from non-magical fire sorry, non-magical light will provide the benefit so you can see, but it does not harm the shadow creatures the same way magical light does.

[Speaker 4]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
Unless it's relevant to the plot.

[Speaker 3]
I can be blind for now, but it's fine. I'll live. Probably.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, a torch for you right now is free.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, having a torch won't doom you. Yeah. There you go.

[Speaker 18]
It just uses up someone's hand.

[Speaker 4]
Yes. Just take the damn torch! Thank you, thank you, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa wouldn't say it as aggressively. She wouldn't say it as aggressively as that. She would just be like, oh no, here you go, and just gently, politely force you to wear it.

Have it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. On the table in Hammermosa is a scrap of paper. Not quite full-size.

Well, actually, it's just one word. You step up to it? That's the word Sight on it.

You pick up the piece of paper, and you think that this would grant darkvision to anyone that used it. But it's one use.

[Speaker 4]
May we ask why?

[Speaker 11]
I still want something to drink that.

[Speaker 4]
Ah. I'm pretty sure my skeleton doesn't unarm strikes. And that drunk wine?

I mean, can I drink it? Sure. Can I digest it?

Probably not. This gives you unarm strikes 1d4 fire damage. It's really high-proof wine.

Just splash it on my bones. Yeah. When you punch someone.

I got seen from Pirates of the Caribbean, where he's drinking and it's just all going through him. Yeah. James is back, but is he back-back?

Good question. Back-back?

[Speaker 1]
While James isn't here, did Mimosa say anything as the shadow spawned? Sorry.

[Speaker 18]
I think she was...

[Speaker 2]
She would... Oh, Cammon, here's a... Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
There's demons. There's shadow guys. Oh dear.

So, Cammon knows Mimosa has something for them, but not what. And this is going to be funny.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we'll just get started then. I'll roll McCannon's initiative. Hot dog, 22.

[Speaker 4]
Um... It's all good, McCannon, you're first.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa said, oh, there's demons, there's shadow in the next room. Wrong door. This one.

I'm going to let you re-chart your move action. In the corner of the room, you see one of them. A shadowy creature.

[Speaker 12]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 1]
This one is going... There's a shadow, sorry. The second shadow is going to go for McCannon, who has stepped into the room.

It steps forward, it reaches out its shadow hand. Get cooked, bro. How do I not kill you from this?

Let's see. You're fine. I roll average, and you're fine.

It's okay. True! With its next action, it tries to steal your shadow.

Oh, I... It's all private, my bad. Reveal.

Reveal. I'm not lying, I create you. With its last action, it tries to steal your shadow.

It just gives you a minus one. An enfeebled one. That's its turn.

Ah, now it is your turn.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to tell Jacob that he just in Like in Life, he brightens up the world. And I cast Light on him.

[Speaker 12]
Alrighty, you gain doomed one.

[Speaker 6]
And then, Jacob will move inside.

[Speaker 1]
What is the range on light?

[Speaker 23]
There is no range.

[Speaker 1]
The radius, sorry. Yeah, it's 24 radius. 20, 20, yeah.

Okay, he's not in the bright light, so the one in the corner is fine, but this guy is definitely affected by the light.

[Speaker 6]
He's going to do a bitey-bite. As Jacob opens up his maws, and he lunges at the creature.

[Speaker 1]
What's Ver's spell save DC?

[Speaker 6]
What for?

[Speaker 1]
Ver's? Yeah, because he's in the light. He makes it so he's stunned one.

[Speaker 16]
And...

[Speaker 1]
He does not have his resistance, so I'll probably need to add it in. Extra. Alright.

Very good. Now that's your... All three?

Yep. Alright, so... When Jacob moved near the shadow, it became more tangible.

The body inside the shadow looks targetable.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty then. Five feet over the couch. He does a cool rogue jump.

And she... Actually... She stabs.

She stabs.

[Speaker 1]
Very nice. Very nice. I'm just going to keep adding the resisted damage because I don't want to toggle it off.

My god, okay, hang on. He takes the additional 60. He's very hurt from that.

With your last action, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 2]
Stab.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. You kill that man.

[Speaker 2]
Stab. Okay. That is my turn.

Or I guess like free action, so she'll... There's also that one in that corner.

[Speaker 13]
Come on.

[Speaker 16]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
What would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
Well, we're... Due to it being dark, you know. Oh!

Success the first time around. Let's go. And then...

I cannot see anything, so we're going to have to... You don't have your torch toggled, or did it go out? No, because of where I'm standing, the torch is toggled, but I have to...

Oh. Yeah. Oh, hey, and now you've got the effect.

Alright. Targeting that guy. What do I have that is one action?

[Speaker 2]
Oh! There we go.

[Speaker 1]
See, the shadow's protected from most of the damage.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, pity. Well, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 10]
Ah. Okay.

[Speaker 18]
Shadow.

[Speaker 5]
Um... Needledarts count as magical, right? I want to try shooting it with a Needledarts.

Okay. And I miss. And then I shield.

[Speaker 13]
Very nice.

[Speaker 5]
And I will not click the end turn so that it does not skip Meek.

[Speaker 11]
Um... Yeah, Meek only hears, like, stab, stab! That's all the narration he's had so far.

[Speaker 1]
It answers the light to attack Kamon.

[Speaker 21]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
It makes a save against the light, it fails, becomes stunned too, which will apply at the start of its next turn. It makes an attack at Kamon.

[Speaker 2]
Ow! Oh dear.

[Speaker 1]
Then it returns to the darkness.

[Speaker 16]
Meek.

[Speaker 1]
They're shadows. They're humanoid in appearance for what you see. There is some kind of body corpse inside the shadow.

The one that Mimosa has just taken down, the shadow mostly departed to reveal the body of a person.

[Speaker 9]
There's one up in the corner. Yes. He will try to blast one up in the corner.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's within 60 feet. I think it is too.

[Speaker 16]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The shadow is still protecting it from where it is. I suppose the fire going toward doesn't produce enough light, right? It does not.

[Speaker 9]
I thought I'd try.

[Speaker 11]
Okay, he's done.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Back to the top with Mechanon. At the start of your turn, being in the magical light, your enfeebled ends.

Yep. You can remove if you would like to do something different. So this one's currently in dim light.

Okay.

[Speaker 12]
I need to...

[Speaker 1]
It... It does affect it, but a d4 isn't enough to... Oh, I guess if it's in its...

Yeah, you'll need to break its resistance for that to take damage, but it can. Take the same penalty an enemy would take. And you succeeded.

Whoops!

[Speaker 17]
Oh! Can you speak your language?

[Speaker 3]
Do you have to understand a bond mod?

[Speaker 1]
It's linguistic. It seems to understand enough for this to work.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. I thought that's what was...

[Speaker 13]
Me and your girl are... me when your girl are...

[Speaker 1]
Bird, do you wish to sustain your light?

[Speaker 2]
I feel like the ender... The doomed condition increases.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, and then Jake will run up and he'll try to fight the shadow creature, immersing him in light.

[Speaker 1]
He gets to... No, he's already stunned, but he is... His resistance is gone from Jacob being next to him.

[Speaker 6]
And then I'll go there and then I'll try to recall knowledge on this guy. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
You've heard of living shadows before, but this is a little bit different. And nothing really comes to mind that could help you right now, unfortunately. Mimosa.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so my computer would disappear and it's taking forever to get back up.

[Speaker 1]
What would you like to do?

[Speaker 2]
Noob and stab, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. One action to stride, two to attack?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Or would you... You are just in the way of everyone else if you stay there, there's a mantle piece between. Do you wish to stay in the way at the end of your turn and attack twice, or move so someone else can move up?

No one else is melee fighter, just go for it. Pretend I said nothing.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I was thinking, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
With your dagger, cold iron, is there any preference in dagger?

[Speaker 21]
No. I mean, if you do the one with the gold ring.

[Speaker 1]
The first is a hit, the second is a miss. It doesn't resist that. It is bloodied?

Oh, well the shadows are weakened, or some shit, I don't know. How to describe a shadow creature being bloodied? That is Mimosa's turn.

Hmm. Kamon just flew at like 600 miles an hour.

[Speaker 3]
Huh?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I must have hit something. I have no clue what happened. Kamon, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
Well, that is sustained so we have three actions. Wow. Let's see.

Can't these guys even they can take mental hurt, can't they? We'll try.

[Speaker 1]
This one comes because he rolls crit.

[Speaker 3]
Good lord.

[Speaker 1]
Being GM lets you roll crits, apparently.

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, what?

[Speaker 1]
Being GM lets you roll crits. I couldn't do this at all last session, but here I am.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, well, I do have one more action. We're going to try and shoot the guy again.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
And I miss. That is my turn.

[Speaker 12]
Okay. Dammit. Arrow.

[Speaker 14]
Okey dokey.

[Speaker 13]
Then I needle darts again. Very good.

[Speaker 12]
You have a chunk of adamantine.

[Speaker 5]
I don't. It automatically shows all three options. I only have cold iron and silver.

[Speaker 1]
Does it have the bar of chalcum as an option?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
Bad. He takes the full damage from that.

[Speaker 5]
Does bar of chalcum do extra damage to anything?

[Speaker 1]
There are some creatures that it bypasses their resistance the same way adamantine does. It's not very common, though.

[Speaker 24]
That's probably why. The adamantine chunk costs 500 gold.

[Speaker 1]
I almost can afford that. If you fuck with time magic the time police will come and beat the shit out of you and it bypasses their resistance.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. Okay, so if we're going to fuck with time we should have- oh, we've already fucked with time.

[Speaker 2]
It wasn't us, technically. Wait, what is our fine for fucking with time? Mimosa and Pera were in the time fuckery a lot.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
If you're not the- You're more victims of the time fuckery of anything, you know?

[Speaker 2]
You know, we did some things that actively undid time.

[Speaker 1]
Well, just be careful of any knocks on your door. Shield's very good.

[Speaker 3]
Needle darts only shows adamantium, silver, cold iron. Nothing fancier than that. I think those are the only things you can make needles out of with that.

[Speaker 1]
We move to the shadow. It is pretty hurt, but it's going to try and kill Mimosa. It's stunned two, so it loses two of its actions.

It will do a shadow hand attack at Mimosa with its only one. It doesn't crit you, Mimosa's too lucky. Nimble dodge does not save you.

You only take five damage.

[Speaker 16]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
At the end of its turn, it takes persistent damage because it is no longer resisting damage. Two, it's still alive. Meek.

It is your turn. Very good. How do you want to do this as he dies?

[Speaker 9]
Meek will summon the fire. Stunner's like, I got this. It looks like a plant, it should burn like one.

Hits the thing and dribbles down almost like a napalm that covers the thing from head to foot.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, buddy.

[Speaker 9]
Told you.

[Speaker 1]
A lot of the shadow burns away, but the body still has a slight aura with this energy. So Meek is always going to be double XP. Mekanon is still level three.

Wait, let me record that statement.

[Speaker 9]
Always double XP. No matter what level he is.

[Speaker 1]
Mekanon is no longer double XP, it's just Meek. Excellent.

[Speaker 10]
Anybody need an active pathos snack? I got nuts, salted or not.

[Speaker 8]
Oh. Um.

[Speaker 16]
Can I have marshmallows?

[Speaker 8]
Mekanon needs a little more than a snack.

[Speaker 10]
I think that'd be caps.

[Speaker 3]
Does it look edible, what you're thinking of?

[Speaker 9]
You just basically hold out your hand and like your preferred snack just shows up in your hand. Like an apple or whatever.

[Speaker 3]
It's lovely. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Can you just do that?

[Speaker 8]
Dang. The script is better.

[Speaker 9]
Kinesis is the masters of enhanced cantrips.

[Speaker 3]
So can you just keep doing that until we're all healed?

[Speaker 9]
No, it only every ten minutes. It has a timer on it.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah. That's the downside.

[Speaker 1]
Changing it to four and minusing a thousand XP will work.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, Mekanon and one other person gets healing.

[Speaker 9]
Mimosa can take some Yeah, I'll take it.

[Speaker 2]
How straight is Kano?

[Speaker 3]
She's down by sixteen points. I'm only down by ten.

[Speaker 2]
You'll get more out of me soon.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Thank you. Would you like some healing potions then?

I do have a couple I could give you.

[Speaker 2]
Um This is Para has no more healing stuff. Yeah, I'll take it.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I have spells, but Yeah.

[Speaker 17]
Alright, I'll give you a couple. One moment.

[Speaker 2]
Well, actually, just roll them for me, please.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Let's see.

[Speaker 16]
Yay.

[Speaker 3]
And I'll roll one more. Oof, okay. So someone else has to do it now.

It seems my luck has thinned out. Do you need You can have a bonus one.

[Speaker 2]
I've got at least one. I'll use my last one.

[Speaker 3]
Who wants to roll this? Oh, okay, you already have one.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Someone hit that one 36, please. Yay.

Thank you. Yippee. That brings me up to full.

This is why I don't roll my health anymore.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. You said you had something before the shadows attacked.

[Speaker 2]
Um This paper. It's, uh Well, you'll figure it out. She gives like a kind of strained, polite I'm sorry kind of smile.

[Speaker 3]
That's alright, sweetheart.

[Speaker 2]
The paper's just Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't give it to you. This one, do you do you spend the action activating and it's a single action?

[Speaker 3]
Sure, I would like to see.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. Gives everyone in the party who doesn't have darkvision?

[Speaker 3]
Me.

[Speaker 2]
It is just It's just me. I brought like Mach Ma throwing rocks at you.

[Speaker 5]
Um, Pera would like to examine the body.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. I'll extinguish the torch for now. There's a skull on this couch.

[Speaker 7]
We can also examine the body.

[Speaker 1]
See if anybody's salvageable for it. Uh, how would you like to examine it? Like a medicine check?

For like cause of death? Or you want to look into the magics of this? Like a religion?

Or cultism? Or a karma?

[Speaker 5]
I would go with religion.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not really trying to find out how they die. Yeah, what do you want to know?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know what I want to know.

[Speaker 1]
Brought the recall knowledge and I'll tell you something. The body itself they seem dressed up as like a like a waitstaff. Like some kind of butler.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so they probably worked here.

[Speaker 8]
Well, we know the butler didn't do it.

[Speaker 1]
Ha ha. Both of the bodies, uh, they seem to have been controlled by this shadow. Uh, Ver only has low light vision, so that is getting upgraded to dark vision.

Uh, is anyone else you can all see? Excellent. Does Ver keep sustaining light?

I say sustaining, but it's more like struggling with light.

[Speaker 23]
I would have stopped it after.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you have a torch that is flickering because the circuitry is a little loose.

[Speaker 1]
The doomed condition, uh, the darkness washes over you and you lose the doomed condition not too long after you stop focusing on light. Yeah. Good stuff.

Watchers want to do.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I do suppose we should look for, continue looking for the author, so we're off to gang. Um, well there's a door over there. Yeah, oh yeah.

Through the door then. Who would like to go first?

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna check for, wait, this door right over here.

[Speaker 16]
Mhm.

[Speaker 2]
I'll check for the trippy traps.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Uh, secret perception, please. Seems all good.

Uh, you do not find any tripwires, you do find some jewelry.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, this is a bathroom.

[Speaker 1]
And you find uh, on the Wow, you don't usually see bathrooms in here.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, this place is just bad.

[Speaker 1]
There's also, there's some jewelry and another manuscript page on the, uh, sink.

[Speaker 2]
I'm picking the jewelry.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you can add this to your character sheet, it's just 50 gold worth of jewelry. Who would like to take the page?

[Speaker 22]
Um, Perra will grab the page.

[Speaker 10]
We should investigate the kitchen, there might be clues there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah? You think?

[Speaker 1]
22 has been added to your inventory. You need to be really careful not to give you the wrong one.

[Speaker 5]
Mimosa, I think this is for you.

[Speaker 8]
Oh!

[Speaker 5]
Um, Perra's gonna hand it over to Mimosa.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Mimosa took the word of power, she could feel its strength, sight, shadows spawned in the corner of the room. Come on, here's the, oh, there's demons.

There's shadow guys. She called out from the lounge room. They did not like her interference in their master's plan.

That's awesome. I don't know how I feel about this being bathroom material.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Oh well. That's what just happened, isn't it?

Perhaps it was put there because we warned us to.

[Speaker 2]
It is what just happened.

[Speaker 3]
Mhm.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Can we see that it, what the page is?

[Speaker 13]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 2]
Like, out of...

[Speaker 5]
You have page 22.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, sorry. Hang on.

[Speaker 1]
You can all have a hero point, by the way, this is great.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I didn't know that. Um, can our characters see if there is a page number on the sheets?

[Speaker 1]
There's not like a 22 out of, like, number, but you know this is 20, like, you have the page numbers of each sheet that you've found.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Yes. What's the highest that we've gotten so far?

[Speaker 2]
I have 39.

[Speaker 8]
I've got 20. I have 17.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! 39 is probably the highest there. I don't think 39 is the end of it, though.

It is very unlikely it is.

[Speaker 22]
But if...

[Speaker 3]
Sorry. I know you were referring to someone else off camera, but you said that the moment Meek came, like, near you.

[Speaker 10]
Just coincidence.

[Speaker 2]
I raised five children. That's no coincidence. No coincidences.

My thought was, if there um, you know, numbers located in a room are corresponding to a part of the house, but I am too brain-dumb to figure that out. Got it.

[Speaker 3]
So... Well, if we're done with the bathroom, we can always investigate the rest of the house and see if there's any number association. So, out we go.

[Speaker 10]
There's no bathroom here. It's an indoor outhouse. Words are strange, aren't they?

[Speaker 1]
I added that jewelry to Mimosa's sheet. It's just listed as Julie Dubois Jewelry.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, cool. Yeah, when I said I was taking it out, I was like, oh wait, we're like...

[Speaker 3]
It seems I've gotten myself stuck in a wall.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, that's a pillow, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, baby. Oh, you look like you had chocolate. I'm following everybody, but I've eaten up the chocolate.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, three directions. Three first of the light. Woohoo!

[Speaker 15]
It's a dark chocolate.

[Speaker 1]
Back in this room, though. You get the doomed condition and it leaves you almost as soon as you gain it. It feels...

sinister. It washes over you. As the darkness cleanses it, it leaves you uneasy.

[Speaker 5]
But there is a room up here that we could check out. Yep, Para's gonna check for traps and all her strong speech.

[Speaker 1]
Would you like to roll the secret perception?

[Speaker 5]
I already did.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent.

[Speaker 5]
Because you've been asking Mimosa.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's a door that's not trapped, as far as you're aware.

[Speaker 22]
Oh, this is crap.

[Speaker 1]
This is crap. I'm glad no one made Lodge characters. People that make maps on Dungeon Alchemist don't like Lodge characters.

No, they don't. Sorry.

[Speaker 15]
You say Tig's gonna struggle.

[Speaker 8]
There's a door. I don't really want to open it while no one else is here. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

[Speaker 16]
I'm coming, I'm coming.

[Speaker 8]
There you are.

[Speaker 1]
Common, you notice he tripped way away? You're about to step.

[Speaker 16]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
It's finally happened.

[Speaker 1]
We can see you got lucky with that one.

[Speaker 2]
Illumination!

[Speaker 1]
Shish kebab skewers. And a floor.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, I rolled a crit, thanks. Just be like, ha!

[Speaker 1]
Barbed wire stretches across the passageway, the perfect height to tear into ankles.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I could've ruined that. Could've ruined my nice pants.

[Speaker 6]
That's more knee height for me. I think I looked somewhere else. Someone might need to remove the lightsaber from them.

On it. Got it.

[Speaker 3]
So darling, are you good at disabling traps? There is... Well, I guess we could just step over it.

It is just a tripwire, but do be careful.

[Speaker 2]
I'd rather not risk it. But still roll to...

[Speaker 10]
I've just pinged it in chat. I'm good with my hands, but I don't have the tools.

[Speaker 16]
No!

[Speaker 6]
Hey! I'm good with that! Hey!

[Speaker 1]
Pushes past the macer and gets some kind of wire cutter out and just snips it. Kinda like twangs. It was pretty strong.

But you disable it. I'm gonna add up every trap you disable and add them together at the end, so I'm not giving you 20 XP every time you come across a tripwire. Don't think into what that could mean.

[Speaker 3]
That is so concerning. Alright. I'll move to where the thing was so that...

Have we been in the kitchen yet? No. Well, we are opening this door.

[Speaker 1]
Did we go in the kitchen before? No, you haven't been in the kitchen yet.

[Speaker 2]
No. We've been in, like, two rooms. We were in, like, a living room and a bathroom.

[Speaker 5]
Wouldn't it be so nice if every house had a bathroom off the living room?

[Speaker 1]
In this room is a nice servant's quarters.

[Speaker 2]
Servant's quarters? It's really nice.

[Speaker 6]
That's the abandoned diary.

[Speaker 2]
You can look for a diary if you'd like. Alright, let's get one for the base.

[Speaker 6]
I've been in here. I'm just going to do a brief illumination of the light.

[Speaker 5]
You know you can see without the light, right?

[Speaker 13]
Yeah, but not as good. Oh, you have darkvision now.

[Speaker 17]
Okay.

[Speaker 12]
No worries.

[Speaker 17]
Have a good one.

[Speaker 16]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Factbinder feats are awesome. Um, I haven't thought about it. Yeah, there are feats I would consider giving as a reward for, like, quests and things, but uh...

Hm.

[Speaker 20]
Um...

[Speaker 16]
Alright.

[Speaker 12]
I'll think about that. They get all the cool shit.

[Speaker 16]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
After a quick look around the room...

[Speaker 1]
You find a manuscript page in here. Uh, and a bit of money. You find, um...

30 gold. I can add that to the party stash if you'd like. That would be great.

[Speaker 3]
Bink. Don't eat that. It's not very good for you.

[Speaker 1]
Did you say torches didn't work? Torches work. They don't provide the magical benefits of light against the shadows.

[Speaker 19]
Oh, that's fun then.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
30 gold manuscript page. I'll read the manuscript page. If...

Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Page 9.

[Speaker 3]
Page 9. Ahem. The staff of the house did not survive long in the veil.

The darkness corrupted them, slowly pushing their sanity aside. Their bodies were taken completely by the shadows. All that remained...

All that remains was the redacted. Hm. So, it does seem to confirm that the poor servants have been eaten by the darkness.

It does beg to wonder what exactly is the redacted. That was ominous. Unless that is to say it was redacted rather than the redacted.

But we should probably investigate the rest of the rooms. Be careful where you step too. I'm going to be much more careful as I walk.

[Speaker 19]
Because even if you have darkvision it still hinders a lot of checks as well too.

[Speaker 3]
I'll check the door. Secret perception. Let's go.

[Speaker 1]
It is not trapped. Hm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I open the door. Watch very carefully where I step and I go in.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what were you referring to, Versari? As far as I'm aware, with darkvision you can see perfectly in darkness. Is there something I've missed?

[Speaker 19]
Um...

[Speaker 2]
Well, everything's grayscale. You can see everything, it's just grayscale.

[Speaker 5]
I think that's D&D though, isn't it?

[Speaker 19]
No, Pathfinder also has differences in perception-based things. Um, yeah.

[Speaker 11]
Meek just summoned fire because every time he's making light and turning it off it's like, ah, just turn it on.

[Speaker 3]
I check I check the room. It does say in black and white only.

[Speaker 5]
But perfectly well is what it says.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, perfectly well is what I'm stuck on. Like, that sounds like you don't have any penalty to checks or anything. Um, but I might have missed something.

There is a lot of stuff in perception and detection. You can't see colors, so you're playing with colorblind. I think there's only the three levels of light.

There's bright, dim, and dark.

[Speaker 5]
And magical darkness if you really want to count them.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's just... In Pathfinder it's just an extra level of darkness I guess, because that's for counteracting with light spells. Checking the chest.

That would be... You find a word of power. I'll add this one to your sheet.

It's just an action to use these. I'm not going to add a description to this because it's all in the title. No, I should add a description so I can tell you what it does.

And then I can just keep copying and moving mine more.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
I'm still wrapping it for you. I have all of these in a Google Doc and I am making the item entries as I go because I wasn't sure how many I'd need. Duplicate.

And I just drag this onto... It should be a word of power refuge. Oops, in a single room is what that should say.

[Speaker 3]
In a single.

[Speaker 1]
Craft single. Now I've updated that.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'll tell the gang what I've seen and say we probably should use it only in emergencies. Or at least keep it around for now.

So that's what was in the chests over here. I'll look under a bed.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing hiding under the beds here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, joy. I didn't find anything that seemed to indicate much except this, which will give us small protection for about... 30 minutes.

[Speaker 10]
And the kitchen.

[Speaker 3]
You did it, good job.

[Speaker 1]
In this area of the kitchen you find a variety of things used in preparing food. The hob stove has not been used in a long time. With the innate ability to sense cheese, you definitely can tell there's some in the pantry room.

Just to the north.

[Speaker 11]
Meek's gonna raid the spice cabinet if he can find it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I know Mimosa took jewels, but we are not sure that this person is dead. So if they're still alive and this is where they live, we are actively stealing their stuff.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we can always return it, saying that we were making sure the shadows didn't show up.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just saying, keep that in mind.

[Speaker 10]
I'm not gonna steal, I just want to see what they use.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's how it starts. Was that a vision test? Were you rolling a vision test for me?

[Speaker 1]
No, I was rolling flat checks. I love rolling flat checks. I just had your token selected, so ignore that Carmen rolled them.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Still ominous, but less.

[Speaker 1]
It's just if something's gonna happen, and on that 19 something is going to happen. Find treasure. In the pantry, you find there's some cheese, there's some grains and things.

You'd have stuff for porridge. There's some salted meats as well, like long life food is in here. There are some things that have spoiled.

You find for the party, it'd be a month's worth of rations of sad food. Eating porridge every day. It looks like there's enough food here to take care of the entire staff of the house, which appears to be a lot of people.

You also find the money set aside for the next trip into town, which is 30 gold.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, fun. I'll add that to the party sheet. I'll add that to the party sheet.

[Speaker 13]
You put that in here.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. That doesn't seem to be much of note, unless you guys would like some preserved meats? Oh, there's also some cheese for you.

I'm pretty sure you can control them. This isn't because you're red. I know you have the potion.

Cheese elixir. Remember giving it to him. Is there anything?

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, yeah. I was on mute, sorry. How does that elixir work?

Does it animate cheese and give it special abilities?

[Speaker 3]
No, I don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
Is it permanent?

[Speaker 3]
A lot. It's an hour, I believe. There is the door that powers it.

I'll try to do that.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I was waiting for the ability to control cheese.

[Speaker 1]
What is the cheese elixir even from? I don't think it's an official item.

[Speaker 2]
It's from a while back. It's a real thing. It's a thing.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but is it an item that James made, or is it an item that's in here?

[Speaker 1]
This is trading good compendium. What is that?

[Speaker 2]
I remember us looking at it and all agreeing that Mur was the one that had to have it. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
The trading good compendium is just a bunch of assorted items for treasure, I think. At least that's what I use it for.

[Speaker 23]
It also has goods for treasure, like flour, metals, that sort of stuff.

[Speaker 5]
It really does just sound like it's permanent, doesn't it? Yeah. I'm going with it.

It's awesome! You can be ruler of the cheese. I don't think they thought about that.

[Speaker 6]
Has anyone seen the show Misfits? Yeah, the lactose...

[Speaker 5]
It also doesn't imply that they get any sort of animation to it. You can just tell the cheese to do something. That doesn't mean it's gonna.

[Speaker 6]
Is it like some sentient cheese?

[Speaker 5]
Maybe.

[Speaker 1]
I think if you animated the cheese somehow, you would be able to command it.

[Speaker 5]
But if you animated the cheese somehow, don't you automatically already become able to command it?

[Speaker 1]
Or maybe if someone else animated cheese. Yeah. You'll be good.

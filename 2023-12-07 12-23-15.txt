[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you did find two items that appear to be sized for those of giants, but they do, if attuned to and if, you know, worked with, they will size back down to the size of like a human or a halfling, whoever happens to use them, but they do still appear oversized. They are gauntlets of ogre power and a deck of illusions. Giant cards.

[Speaker 7]
What are they again?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to put them in the, I'm going to put them in the accession reports. I'll also put the gold in there. What happened along the way was you met a sage or guiding spirit.

He was guiding spirit in this case. Just kind of took the form of a bunch of rocks that had been levitated. Just formed a friendly face, pointed you in a specific direction along the mountain trail and pointed you to a cairn.

An actual rock cairn and underneath of it was a whole bunch of gold, which I'll be posting shortly, some fine silks and jewelries, a couple of art objects, and those two magic items. I don't know if anybody's familiar with like the really oversized magic cards that I think you could get for a commander, is it?

[Speaker 4]
I was going to say that you can get them in real life.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, like a giant. I have one. My sister got me a giant set of deck of cards.

Shut up. Oh, grandma eyes are like, what's the number?

[Speaker 2]
Oh my God. They have giant sized Pokemon cards too. I love the idea of oversized cards.

It's so fun.

[Speaker 1]
There's a thing in the 5e DNG about like, oh, who made this item? What does it, how does it change? And the one for giants is primarily just, it's really, it'll still shrink down to like human size if a human is using it, but it's, it's still ridiculously big.

[Speaker 2]
That's all they got going for them.

[Speaker 4]
But Melissa's going to take some of the jewels and the silks for her own self.

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, to direct you guys to where you are now, you're at the first little.

[Speaker 3]
We're still in the search area, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. I'm just going to do, I'm just going to call this caravan and that will be, will indicate current position.

[Speaker 3]
I see. On this area.

[Speaker 2]
We're literally in the search area, right on the R.

[Speaker 3]
Have we been out here for like the whole time?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah. Y'all have been rocking it for the past little while.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee has been hunting and bringing like fish and small animals.

[Speaker 4]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Occasionally, for the larger animal.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, yay.

[Speaker 1]
And a bit of hot chocolate that Nessie has been invited to accompany along with any of any friends that she should have pushed to bring along has been invited to the big bad evil guy has invited the, the, his enemies to participate in a ballot where he delivers some hot chocolate and presents to the children of the valley.

[Speaker 3]
How kind.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Mr. Santa Claus. I don't know if you would appreciate being called that.

[Speaker 2]
Apparently Santa actually does exist here though.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. He's probably on good terms with Santa. Who he's filling in for is the thing.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Give the big guy a break.

[Speaker 3]
Like he gives us a break?

[Speaker 1]
He did last Christmas specifically. You weren't here for it, but he actually did do it for last Christmas and last Easter. I think.

[Speaker 4]
Go up past the field of, I don't know, the orange thing. And then there's mountains on the right.

[Speaker 2]
What do you see? Like where? That's Nessie, no?

[Speaker 4]
She's, she's below the sunflower fields.

[Speaker 1]
You gotta go way up until you see the search area.

[Speaker 4]
Zoom out and then, yeah, right here.

[Speaker 2]
Can you see my line?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, could you insert just the token, James? Somewhere? I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I do that. Oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah.

So you see the search? Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I just moved it over.

[Speaker 3]
So remind me again what we're searching for. We're searching for like a tower.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa's grandma's tower.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
What's your grandmother's name? Great name.

[Speaker 4]
I'll take that. Sorry, what was it?

[Speaker 3]
Marsha.

[Speaker 4]
Marsha. Okay. Marsha.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I typed that with Tiana's name. Here we go. All right, Tiana, are you able to see the, uh, the location now?

[Speaker 6]
I'm still on the big normal map.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. What I mean is, um, do you see the search area that they've been moving through?

[Speaker 6]
White dragon search area.

[Speaker 1]
No. Nope. Uh, further to the right.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's right. I accidentally moved Tiana over there. There we go.

I'm gonna fix that one. Uh, there we go. Right next to the little thing that says caravan.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, this is correct.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So, where would the party like to go next?

[Speaker 4]
Have we come across a town?

[Speaker 1]
Not in this area. Y'all are in the fucking wilderness as far as you're concerned. There were no villages along the left side of the mountain path, barely any signs of human habitation whatsoever.

Like, you might have seen an abandoned cabin.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. That we definitely slept in.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
This is reasonable.

[Speaker 4]
Well, the only thing I can think of is finding a high vantage point. Yeah, we might have to climb.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we have a couple of unfortunate distractions up here. Oop. Hello.

Hello, do you want to block me? Okay, come here.

[Speaker 4]
All right, now you're not blocking. Cat walks across our map.

[Speaker 2]
A big ol' orange thing. Um, do we want to circle the mountains? Do we want to try and go up the mountains?

Can anyone fly?

[Speaker 3]
Kibi can't.

[Speaker 2]
I can wildshape.

[Speaker 6]
Hm? You can fly? I can wildshape into like a bird.

No, right now I can't. They put the restriction on it. I can cause fine familiarism.

[Speaker 7]
Hm, that might work. Definitely.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I will, you know, use one of my wildshape challenges. To cause fine familiarism.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. And an owl would probably be best. So then perhaps it can like fly up on this cat.

Sounds reasonable.

[Speaker 1]
All right, you send it flying around. Right now the party is looking for a tower in the nearby area. Sending the owl up and up and up to fly, see if they can detect anything on the horizon.

Doesn't really look like they've discovered any kind of features that would indicate a tower. There is a big, old, look at that aurora signature. There is a fairly large building on the cliffside.

Now there's no trail leading up there, but there is a trail going around both sides of the mountain, or of this mountain range. So the caravan can go either way.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I really like this information, of course. Well, we could check out the building, see if any living beings are in there. Sounds like a plan.

Um, so I guess we'll have to leave the caravan.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy. Are there woods- Familiar here to keep watch?

[Speaker 7]
Are there woods as spooky over here as they were by the Dwarven stronghold?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, can you say that one more time?

[Speaker 7]
Are there woods as spooky over here as they were by the Dwarven stronghold?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, this seems to be much more fine. Okay. More mundane.

It's been a little bit more magical weather. You have seen the occasional, like, face in the rocks, but for the most part, everything on the left side of this mountain range has been pretty friendly. You kind of feel like it's the sense of being watched, but like the sense of being watched by something that likes you and wants you to succeed.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. So we should be able to leave the caravan just fine. Yeah.

Mimosa will give them a stranger danger talk right before they leave anyway.

[Speaker 1]
All right, sweet. Any specific direction you all want us to start moving along or?

[Speaker 3]
Where'd you say these trails were again?

[Speaker 1]
Is it just the green? Left and they go right. Yep, basically around the green.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm not too keen on water.

[Speaker 2]
They're gonna run into water on the other side too.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we are.

[Speaker 7]
Might as well get it over with. We'll go to the left then. Yeah, Kibi will start charging that way.

[Speaker 3]
Ready to face it head on. Oh, absolutely angry.

[Speaker 7]
Wait, can you hear me now? Yes. My microphone isn't muting itself properly.

That's a shame.

[Speaker 4]
Did you have an opinion on which way to go?

[Speaker 6]
I don't think I know enough about the quest, so to speak, to how one really could flip a coin.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, and we'll just still go left. Left it is. Okay, I'm going to roll for weather.

Magic weather.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, fun. Okay, there is a soothing mountain mist has come down from the... Come down from...

Oh, wait, no, no, it's not a soothing mountain mist. Sorry. No, it's not mist at all.

It's, uh, it's currently drizzling. And visibility has been pretty heavily reduced.

[Speaker 7]
Wait, you too? Sorry, did you say it was drizzling? No, what?

[Speaker 1]
It is drizzling. Um, raining, basically.

[Speaker 4]
Light rain. My favorite weather, actually.

[Speaker 1]
My favorite weather as well.

[Speaker 4]
I like mist as well, when it's misty. Okay, well, everybody stay close.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi does not like this weather either. But less so than being completely drenched in water.

[Speaker 6]
Could I, like, use shape water to just keep the water off me? For purely flavor reasons?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, it takes a fair bit of work, but you're able to compose, as time goes on, you're able to compose a watery umbrella that isn't too heavy and tends to, you know, divert the runoff to some poor sap next to you. All right, so on the first day, uh, on the first days of travel, you still have a rough idea of where you are, but you've gone, you've veered far to the north compared to your original intention. You're not quite sure what the trail to the water actually is from this point.

Like, you basically, you've come, because the visibility is so poor, you must have taken a wrong turn at some point. You've gone up, and you've come across the, a foot trail for the mountain going north.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. You got an answer? I guess that's where we're supposed to head?

[Speaker 4]
Well, it's a way to go.

[Speaker 1]
No, you guys, you guys are lost.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Um, we're lost in the woods, right?

[Speaker 2]
Or, um, how many long rests would you say we've had since we were at the hold?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, uh, plenty. I think you guys specifically have been through, I think it's been about 14 days? What is it?

Mimosa's Caravan Sessions. Mimosa's Caravan arrives at the Dwarven Hold. That was on the 4th of this month.

It is the 23rd, so you've had 19 long rests since then.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I should probably just be able to, like, long rest fully?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can quote that. You'll be fine.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I have to find the path.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so all of us long rests.

[Speaker 8]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
I can speak of find the path, what is it?

[Speaker 2]
I have to know what it was, so, like, I could find our way back to the path we were at, but I could not just say, oh, let's find the path to her tower.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's unfortunate.

[Speaker 2]
I think, at least? Um, yeah, you have to know how far it is and in what direction it lies. Oh, I guess if you're lost, it's kind of useless.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that doesn't seem very useful. The path that you were on was somewhere over in this hex. You were familiar with it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, that's how it works. Okay, for the duration, as long as you're on the same existence. You know how far- Okay, that makes more sense.

I misread that because I skipped. Um, okay, fix specific location that you're familiar with on the same plane of existence. Um, okay, so this would work.

All right, I'm casting it then. It's just now that I've cast it, I know how far it is and where it is.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you've changed it. No, no, well, I made a new one ages ago. This is probably the one that's going to appear in Chilmus Valley.

It's probably going to have a different name.

[Speaker 2]
Is it different? This looks exactly the same.

[Speaker 1]
No, the first one does.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's the original, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and then if you scroll down, let's see here. All right, so you just find the path you guys are going to backtrack it sounds like.

[Speaker 3]
All right, can you ping? Are we- oh, hold on. Are we still right around here?

[Speaker 1]
Sounds like you guys are backtracking. Is that- Oh, okay. Can somebody give me a clear answer on that?

Perfectly acceptable way to get around being lost.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, you know what?

[Speaker 3]
Let's do it. I think- what is Kibi? Is she one of them trail people?

Hold on. Trail boys.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, she's got that fourth level get out of dodge thing and survival dice. What's going on? I don't actually know.

Oh, I don't actually know what Kibi's second little subclass thing is.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's trailblazer.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I think she just doesn't have everything on her sheet.

[Speaker 2]
She could easily move over from my little pre-made stuffs.

[Speaker 3]
I do have- I thought I had most of it. Yeah, I think I do actually have it. No, most of it anyway.

Ah, trail discovery. At sixth level, you can attempt to seek. Oh, okay.

Could that help?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and pick it in chat.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think you can.

[Speaker 2]
No, I don't think you can.

[Speaker 8]
What?

[Speaker 2]
It's for finding like specific items. I was pulling out a crinkly thing. ASMR. They had the giant candy canes and I had to indulge. Of course.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you ping it by hovering over it and when the little P20 icon comes up, that's what you can click on.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 8]
I can do that. Boop.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are free to use the exploration rolls if you wish. If you have anything relevant to these.

[Speaker 3]
Let me look.

[Speaker 6]
I could. Are there any animals around?

[Speaker 1]
There are. There are quite a few. Today, you probably would have come across a herd of, I believe, up in this region.

It's deer and moose, primarily. Terrifying. And then there's a couple of dinos that have just kind of been running.

[Speaker 3]
Dinos? Yep. Dinos?

[Speaker 1]
Dinos. Oh, that's pretty cool. Saber-toothed tigers.

[Speaker 4]
Does anyone want to go hunting? I can. I am also a rogue scout, so I can be helpful.

[Speaker 2]
And a trapper.

[Speaker 4]
And a trapper, yes. I am built for the wilderness.

[Speaker 6]
Do you want to hunt? Or do you just want to get food? Oh, um.

[Speaker 5]
I have goodberry, so you can just eat one and be fine for the next round.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[Speaker 8]
We need a meal.

[Speaker 3]
Hunting for fun. Um, well, Phoebe would be hunting for fun and food. Um, yeah.

Fishing, foraging, and hunting. I get an additional 200 XP. That's wonderful.

[Speaker 1]
On the way back to the original Hex, you guys find a shrine to... It's pretty much in the same place as the trail. You're on the same trail as you were originally, having now backtracked.

But on a little side trail that you wouldn't have noticed going the other way is a shrine to Orion, which is the elven hunter god.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, let's stop it, huh?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Let's pay him a visit. Yeah, let's bring a kill here.

I would assume he was at the party.

[Speaker 1]
Orion? No, no, no. No, he wasn't.

Except for the green god of Orton, but only accidentally. Somebody was wearing his skin.

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy. I hate it when that happens. Um, yeah, I'm gonna go hunting.

I think we should set up a little camp here before we set off.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, this will be fun. So the way that hunting works...

Flora, what's your new character's name?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, Malbeth. Did you? Yeah, Malbeth.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Malbeth, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I thought you were, like, saying Malibu, like, really quickly.

[Speaker 8]
Malbeth.

[Speaker 1]
Malbeth, okay. So the way that hunting works is if you go over to... Global Tables.

No, it's in Journal. Go to Journal. Go ahead and click on Chillness Valley PDFs.

[Speaker 6]
Exploration?

[Speaker 1]
This one will be on downtime. We are going to pull up Exploration in a moment. Once you've clicked on downtime, go to Natural Acquisitions.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hang on one sec.

[Speaker 1]
No words?

[Speaker 6]
Wait, National... Is that in the... I'm in downtime right now.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So just scroll down the side, you'll see Natural Acquisitions. It's on...

It's one of the chapter headers.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
And that's where you'll see... They're listed in alphabetical order. You'll see Hunting.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. But, like, why? I could just eat a good berry.

[Speaker 1]
No, you could. I just want to let you know what the other people are going to be doing in a moment.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely, definitely.

[Speaker 1]
Preparation, Tracking, the Pause, and the Kill.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's pretty good.

[Speaker 2]
Nature, Survival. Technically, also, you have a chance of getting, like, a magical item or magical, like, critter that does some cool stuff when you do it. Wait, do I see XP?

[Speaker 6]
You get XP from hunting.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Really? Okay, I want to hunt.

[Speaker 1]
I want to forage. Once you've done that, go ahead and pull up Exploration because there's one other thing that you, as a... All the classes, whenever they do these activities, they have different benefits that they can gain from it depending on whether they succeed or fail.

And so that's where you'll pull up the Exploration page and go down to Class Effects.

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Scroll down to the one for Druid.

[Speaker 6]
Is it just the main class or the one you start with?

[Speaker 2]
Like...

[Speaker 1]
If you have multiple classes, you could use any of them.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Are you using the one in the Foundry itself or are you using a PDF?

[Speaker 1]
I'm using Foundry.

[Speaker 2]
If you click on Class Effects, on the left hand side there's also just like a list of the classes and you can just skip straight to them.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's why it's run out of it. Because... But yeah, that's what I did.

I just opened them that way. Okay, so I can like sacrifice it to the... Oh yeah, that's wonderful.

I can summon the creature as per the find for me as well.

[Speaker 3]
Do I go ahead and roll for hunting?

[Speaker 1]
Go right ahead.

[Speaker 3]
All righty.

[Speaker 1]
As can anybody else who's attempting to do mysterious.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm, I will cook.

[Speaker 3]
Nature or history. Definitely nature.

[Speaker 2]
You don't have one for foraging. What did I get? Hold on.

Okay, 13.

[Speaker 1]
Foraging as Druid?

[Speaker 2]
No, I mean on the... On like the Exploration thing. There's no like roll for foraging or anything specifically.

17.

[Speaker 3]
Khan. Rainsaint. Khan.

[Speaker 1]
No, for foraging is uh, what is it? Perception or survival. History or nature.

Nature or sleight of hand. Nature or survival.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, and I meant like the Exploration roll, sorry. Like you have a fisher and you have a hunter, but you don't really have like a forager type one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's a survivalist.

[Speaker 3]
Can I like sneak up on my prey and behead it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, it does say that. I don't think we've ever had a survivalist do it that way.

[Speaker 4]
I think he'd be doing what camels do, where the head just, where the mouth just goes over the head.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Oh yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'm gonna use my great axe. What? That is not what I wrote.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna, I'm gonna like leap from a rock or something. And probably miss. Does that miss?

[Speaker 1]
All right, so the 13s and the 11s are fails.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You can add dice.

[Speaker 3]
I can reroll them. Or I can add to them actually.

[Speaker 1]
You so desired.

[Speaker 3]
All right, I'm gonna do... Do I, do I know what I have to get?

[Speaker 1]
Uh yeah, 17 is, I think the 17 is gonna be the BC.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll just roll like... Oh god, um...

[Speaker 1]
The weather is still grabby. How much longer is that weather? Why, why does it roll on something else?

All right, two. That weather will keep up for two more days.

[Speaker 6]
Do I roll the same?

[Speaker 1]
Like, uh... If you're hunting? Absolutely.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, yep.

[Speaker 3]
Do I choose this nature history?

[Speaker 1]
You do. Okay. Okay, the party is not getting lost right now because they are in the same area.

[Speaker 3]
It was overkill, but it was worth it. I did four, I expended four of my eight dice. Uh, and three, uh, yeah, three of them would have been enough to boost me.

So, um...

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. All right, so you got four successes. So you could choose to...

All right, and it's inclement weather again. Let's see here. So with four successes, you can grab either...

So it's three successes to get a magic result, two for a rare result, or one for common. You let me know how you want to split those up. Uh, me?

Or, or Mal? Well, you, because you got four successes, right?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, um, I'm sorry. Can you say that one more time?

[Speaker 1]
It's three successes for a magical result, two for a rare, and one for a common. Uh, the best one. Let me know how you want to split those up.

[Speaker 3]
The, the, the, the one that's the best.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to do one magic and one common?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right, roll me 2d20.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, interesting. Oh, very lucky.

[Speaker 1]
18 and a 2. I'm pretty sure that 18 is to reroll something.

[Speaker 3]
Want me to do one more?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so the 2 is... You get two deer.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, yeah, that's enough to feed us all.

[Speaker 1]
They're twice as valuable for making bait.

[Speaker 3]
Nice, I might do that. Or, no, I'm not going to do that because we need food.

[Speaker 1]
Bounty, go ahead and roll twice. And you're going to ignore results higher than 17.

[Speaker 3]
You want me to roll twice?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, and a bounty.

[Speaker 3]
Two d20s?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. Okay. That was really a six.

Ah, okay. So you hunt down an eight-legged horse.

[Speaker 8]
Holy crap, what does that even look like?

[Speaker 6]
I'm not going to kill it.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. The hunting of this creature imparts the Deathward spell to the hunter.

[Speaker 3]
All right, so I already rolled for attack, but can I take that back?

[Speaker 1]
You can.

[Speaker 3]
I attacked the deer. I attacked the deer. I didn't attack the horse.

Can I not attack the horse? I want to keep the horse.

[Speaker 1]
The second thing that you found on the way back after wrapping this critter up was a garribore, which is a minor earth elemental that can haul up to 2,000 pounds, despite being the size of a small pony.

[Speaker 8]
Wow.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wow. That's useful.

[Speaker 1]
Especially given your current circumstances.

[Speaker 4]
Have you seen, what is it? It's Madagascar 2?

[Speaker 1]
I have not.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, they're in Africa or whatever, and the lion's going feral, and he chomps on his zebra friend. And his zebra friend wakes up going, what are you doing? And the lion's like, oh, shit!

And he goes, I'm counting your stripes! And I just pictured that's what Kibi does. Absolutely.

It goes to my dad and I'm like, oh, I just pet you or some crap. I wasn't attacking you, I wasn't trying to eat you. Anyway.

[Speaker 1]
All right, and Marvin, what have you got for your next rolls?

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, so I still continue rolling even if I... Okay, okay, okay. Okay, survival.

[Speaker 8]
And then...

[Speaker 2]
Why do your rolls look like that?

[Speaker 1]
I think they're going through D&D Beyond.

[Speaker 8]
Yes. Ah.

[Speaker 6]
And then attack rolls, all of them. What do you want? Can it be like a cannon tree, or what do you...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that could be a catcher.

[Speaker 8]
That's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Something using your proficiency bonus.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that should be all of them.

[Speaker 1]
All right, you've got two successes, so you can roll on the rare table. Or you can roll twice on the common table.

[Speaker 6]
Preferably rare. Is that in the downtime thing too?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see, go ahead and roll just 2d20, because that's the table that it gets compared to. And I think some of these are in... What did you get?

[Speaker 8]
Same.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, the same as it.

[Speaker 1]
I see.

[Speaker 6]
11 and 9.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so for forest rare hunting results, we've got... Ah! The first one is a gara stag, which is a...

It's a stag that kind of looks like a... Kind of looks like it's made out of rock. The hooves make for excellent glue and reduce crafting time by one quarter.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Can I, like... It's the second, like, sacrifice into the land to gain it as a family for a month.

[Speaker 1]
You can. The second item is a sage bear, because I don't know which one you want to sacrifice or both.

[Speaker 6]
A sage bear?

[Speaker 1]
A sage bear. The eyes of these creatures double range and duration of a divination spell and removes its concentration requirement once.

[Speaker 6]
Does it have, like, a normal bear stat block, or like...

[Speaker 1]
It'd probably have a normal bear stat block, but it would be able to... It's like a... If you're seeing through its eyes as per familiar, it might extend way further beyond, or it might be able to cast your sight similar to a scrying spell.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, let's grab the bear, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. And then for the stag, are you going to... Are you going to kill that one, or are you going to sacrifice it?

[Speaker 6]
Let's kill that one.

[Speaker 1]
I guess in both cases you're killing it, but you're...

[Speaker 6]
One goes to the higher purpose. I mean, there's... Yeah, let's send it to the...

Let's give it back to the forest.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. And are any of you doing... Let's see here.

I think one of you mentioned doing something with the shrine.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, one of my kills. I want to present it. The best kill I'd like to present to the shrine.

[Speaker 1]
That's probably the... My best. That's probably the horse.

[Speaker 3]
Probably, yeah. Did we get anything? Did you say we got any perks from the dead horse?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, by hunting it, you get the... You specifically get the effects of the death ward spell.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, all right. Well, yeah, we'll sacrifice that one to the shrine.

[Speaker 1]
All right. And then do you want to do any... Do you want to incorporate the shrine into your sacrifice, Malvin?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, no, not... Probably not. I would just give it back to the forest.

[Speaker 1]
That's totally fine. Let's see here. All right, so the...

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wait. Do animals have souls in this universe?

[Speaker 1]
Souls? No, they have, like, spirits, but not, like, full... You need something with, like, a full emotional range.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, can I, like, snatch a soul?

[Speaker 1]
Spirit. That's what I figured that you were doing. I thought you were going to sacrifice all the shrine itself.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but I don't know who this shrine belongs to, you know?

[Speaker 1]
What's that?

[Speaker 3]
Who does this shrine belong to?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's an elven hunter god named Orion.

[Speaker 3]
To help us on our journey. Okay, I guess. Yeah, sure.

Then let's sacrifice it there, I guess.

[Speaker 6]
He or she, or if they have helped us.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Oh, let's see here. Uh, I'm hearing background noise, by the way.

I don't know if that's me, or if it's gone through. All right, so I get to adjudicate one of my other fun results now. Um, so a small horde of boggarts, which are these little twig and stick men.

I'm gonna drop this in... I should put this in some aid. Boogaloo.

I have... This is one of the few critters for which I actually have too many... Huh.

I have too many pictures of these guys.

[Speaker 3]
A beloved creature.

[Speaker 1]
It is a beloved creature. The question is... If I just look for a boggart in my downloads...

Oh, I got... Okay, I have two tokens for them, specifically. All right, this is what they look like if you go into some aid boogaloo.

Uh, poor representation of them.

[Speaker 3]
I look like a potato with blue eyes.

[Speaker 1]
Basically, if I look for... Tell you what, if I just look for boggart... K-O-A, they pop up there?

[Speaker 4]
They do!

[Speaker 1]
They're pretty cute. And then I know that we stole these guys for seven willows, so they are somewhere around those documents as well. I'll just keep uploading them.

About... Let's see here, I think they're CR1, so I think about 20 of them have arrived, and they're led by a boggart warrior, which is one carrying a maquidal, which I think I've definitely mispronounced again. Instead of being composed of wood and obsidian flecks, it is composed out of wood and amber flecks, with amber in the center of it.

Ooh! They've arrived, and they are currently being peaceful. They're just kind of hanging out, holding their hands out, trying to see if they could help some of the townspeople with, like, loading their ship.

Gibi is suspicious. And all of them bear the three... Instead of that little circle in the middle of their mask, they all three...

They all bear the three arrow mark of... Three arrows not mark of Orion.

[Speaker 8]
Oh!

[Speaker 3]
We were just at the Shrine of Orion. Okay, I trust them.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. So I'm gonna get Bear as a familiar. That's gonna be fun.

[Speaker 6]
That's what I want to do, sir.

[Speaker 1]
Morgan's gonna be jealous. We have a bear man in the party. We have a designated bear for the party who turns into a bear, and wild shapes bears, and summons bears, and summons more bears.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
A very bear-themed character. He's gonna be sad he missed out on the introduction of another bear. So the party's been camped here for about another four days.

Let me do...

[Speaker 2]
Um, could I do a foraging?

[Speaker 1]
You absolutely could.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, hear me out.

[Speaker 6]
I have an idea.

[Speaker 2]
I have a...

[Speaker 6]
I can locate an animal of a specific kind within five miles of me. Can I attempt to track... Like, that horse was pretty cool, right?

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah, it was.

[Speaker 6]
It was pretty good, yeah. Can I attempt to track all horses with that?

[Speaker 1]
The kind of Slipknot, uh, yes, you absolutely can.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, I need to find these. It's like, locate the animals and plants. Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant.

So, yeah, the... I'll be right back. The horse.

Within five miles. Is there such a horse?

[Speaker 1]
There is. It is specifically to the north end of... So, at the north end of the hex that was one west, there was the trail that led upwards.

In this hex, if you look five miles around you, which is pretty... Which covers about... Yeah, the hexes are about 24 miles wide.

You're smack in the middle of it. So, you're getting... You've got most of it.

You get a little ping to the... You get, like, just the faintest ping going north on this end of the hex.

[Speaker 6]
Can I attempt to hunt it?

[Speaker 1]
You can.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. So, it's the usual route?

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Okay. I'm going to update your token so it shrinks on this particular map.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you. So, nature thing. A 13.

And then survival. And what's the third row? It was like...

The last one is like... I'm just going to look it up again.

[Speaker 1]
You want to look it up again?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Natural institutions. Insight, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Last one is either insight or the attack row. Yeah, there you go.

[Speaker 6]
And then it's the attack row. Because it's like... It's nature, survival, insight, and then attack row.

26.

[Speaker 1]
All right. So, you do catch up to the creature. It has not been...

Let's see here, because that's a magical result. So, you have... Go ahead.

[Speaker 6]
If I cast Pass Without Trace, does that do anything? Can I attempt to stealth upon it better?

[Speaker 1]
That seems totally reasonable for me.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, yeah. I cast Pass Without Trace. I can do that, actually.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, you find... You want...

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to describe this briefly, and then ask me the question. You find Sleipnir, this Sleipnir-style horse.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
By a patch of impassable terrain, which is like the sheer rock wall going up the mountainside. And you see it sink into the earth. Just kind of like phase through as you're getting ready to do the final blow.

It hangs around in that area for a little bit. You wait for it to come back out, and that's when you'll be able to strike. But it appears to have moved through an illusion.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, there's an illusion in the mud?

[Speaker 1]
There's an illusion in the earth.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, that's... Oh.

[Speaker 1]
It's going underground.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Can I attempt to, like... You know, what's it called?

Like, knock it out, so to speak? And I was wondering if you wanted me to roll stealth.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's totally fine to knock it out. I assume that you do that when you sacrifice it, generally speaking?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, no, like, when I sacrifice it, I can have it as a familiar for a month. Yeah, I was thinking I would just not kill it, and then I can cast Awaken on it, and then it's charmed by me for a month instead.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, sure.

[Speaker 6]
And then I can, like, try to tame it, actually.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
That works.

[Speaker 1]
Good way to get information about the local area.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, what?

[Speaker 1]
I said it's a really good way to get information about the local area.

[Speaker 4]
It's also a pretty cool horse.

[Speaker 1]
It is a pretty fucking cool horse.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yes, and it's functional.

[Speaker 1]
It's got a movement speed of 80.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god, so it's a 100. Okay, that's very good. So it's knocked out, right?

[Speaker 1]
It is. And roll an encounter. Have you brought anybody with you for this fair, humble journey?

[Speaker 6]
No, probably not, unless we want to retcon that. Yeah, probably not. If it's too difficult, I will conjure animals.

Apologies in advance. I haven't prepared macros yet.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're fine. As far as the... let's see here.

You're fine. As you're taking the horse back, I assume you have, like, a hunting harness or something that you've developed for this, so you can drag it back. And you're a druid, so you use conjurer animals to, like...

[Speaker 6]
Uh, only if I... yeah, only if I need to. It's a pretty expensive spell.

But yeah, sure, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
It's also a pretty heavy horse. Horses already being heavy. Let's see here.

[Speaker 6]
Let's get, like, a ton of velociraptors if combat happens to happen anyway.

[Speaker 1]
On your way back, you do discover another shrine. This one is, too... let's see here.

Won't this be, too? Oh, I know who it is. All right, you find a shrine that is...

that appears like a... This one's a little bit more unique to the valley, so I'm not gonna say the name of it. But this one kind of looks like an elf, but with, like, the alien...

Like, the skull from Alien. It's kind of, like, H.R. Gigerd, a little bit, is the best way of describing it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
She's standing over a squirming creature with a lot of... With no head, and it's just kind of all tentacle limbs squirming, being pierced by a coral spear.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, it's a statue, or is there an actual elf?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's a statue. This is a shrine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, yeah, I thought so.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi finds this unsettling.

[Speaker 6]
I would like... can I... How far am I from everyone?

A couple of miles.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you'll be back, like, within the hour. Oh, okay. There are so many shrines in this place.

[Speaker 6]
I wanted to, like, relay the fact that I found an illusion.

[Speaker 3]
It's a very shriney place.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but I... How much time is passing, technically speaking? I can...

[Speaker 1]
You guys would have spent across... Let's see here. Across these days, it would have been...

One, two, three, four, five. Right now, you guys started here on the 23rd of this month. You are currently up to the 28th.

Across all the days you've been doing this.

[Speaker 6]
Are you guys fine with waiting a couple of hours? Because I would like to cast Awaken, and it takes, like, eight. You can long rest if you want to.

Why are you casting Awaken? To get a horse friend.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Fully support this.

[Speaker 6]
We need that horse. And it's, like, a very good horse. Like, that's pretty cool.

And it does not require components because I'm casting it through the staff.

[Speaker 3]
All right. We can finish up eating the two deer that we... Uh, cooked.

So, Awaken. Oh, wow. We're gonna have a talking horse.

I'm not sure if it can talk. Yeah, it gains the ability- Oh, it gains the ability to speak. Dude, that's so cool.

See, that's why I want this so badly.

[Speaker 6]
I want to hear this horse talk. Okay, quick question. Does anyone have an intelligence score below 10?

That was louder.

[Speaker 3]
No. I don't think Kiwi does. I think Kiwi's smarter than 10.

[Speaker 1]
I need to get some... Hello. I'm Mr. Red. It's impossible. Mr. Red. Finally on DVD.

Like what? Oh, no. Rawr.

Relive the misadventures of Wilbur Post and his troublemaking sidekick. For a man. All right, I have like- I have seven strength.

[Speaker 4]
You have seven? Yeah, I'm- Okay, that makes you feel better. I have nine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, as long as we don't fight any of those. Anything that tries to grapple me, I'm good. Ha.

[Speaker 2]
Jam's frantically writing that down.

[Speaker 1]
No, no.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, but I can fly, so I should be safe for the most part. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Everybody who flies is safe.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, wait, wait, wait. How much- Oh, yeah, no. How much did it weigh for it to like float?

[Speaker 1]
25 pounds.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, okay. Ah, shame.

[Speaker 1]
Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'm thinking- But if you have the enlarge-reduce spell, you could probably play around with that.

[Speaker 6]
But it doesn't reduce weight though, right?

[Speaker 1]
Enlarge-reduce? It reduces weight by about half.

[Speaker 6]
I love physics.

[Speaker 1]
That was a- Enlarge-reduce I don't think has changed since- I know it hasn't changed since AD&D. It might not have changed since OD&D.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yes. Enlarge-reduce, it just casually changes mass.

[Speaker 1]
Wow. Exactly. Imagine- As an AD&D, you would cast that on the wizard so that they could like- There was an interaction with a weaponless combat system that would rely on weight.

So you would cast that on the wizard so they could start doing some flying elbow drops and pile drivers and- I mean, but that makes sense.

[Speaker 6]
If you would like double your size, you would even- No matter how weak you are, you would still- You would still drop.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck a giant. Exactly.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, exactly. Imagine you're like- You would kill a dude. Five- You can even be- Imagine you're five foot- Boom, ten foot.

And you weigh double the amount, you can just- Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Now I can reach the tall shelves.

[Speaker 6]
But I have the horse now, right?

[Speaker 1]
You do have the horse now, and they are- They have been awakened. If we're going to the next day. I think it takes eight hours to cast it, right?

Yes. Alrighty, so I will- Let's get back to tower. Okay.

And I'll add a little note here for- What would you like this creditor's name to be?

[Speaker 6]
Actually, what's a good name for a horse with nine legs?

[Speaker 4]
Nine? I thought it had eight.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, eight legs. It does have eight legs.

[Speaker 2]
No, nine legs would be too bad. Sir Horse legs a lot.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry. Oh, that hurts. Okay, let's see.

Wait, so I cannot have a name which begins with A. Can the horse have a name which begins with A?

[Speaker 1]
The horse can have a name that begins with A, that's fine.

[Speaker 6]
Let's take, like, copy-paste from Baldur's Gate. Answer.

[Speaker 1]
Answer?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'll click save code here. All right, y'all are on the 29th of this particular month.

[Speaker 4]
Answer. I heard answer. Yeah.

Yeah. No, no, no, it's all good. I don't know if I would have heard anything else with a different accent, so.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, that's how you pronounce answer, so.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Reminded me- I don't know what movie it was. My dad told me about it. But there's an apocalyptic one where this guy had a dog, and the dog's name was Hey You.

So you'd just be like, hey you, get over here!

[Speaker 6]
But, like, do we want to move on? Like, this is very interesting. Maybe we can check the illusion out.

[Speaker 2]
Does answer have any idea of any towers around?

[Speaker 6]
Does the answer have an answer on where the- Let's ask the horse. And, like, please, please be nice to the horse. It's going to be a real trouble getting it to, like, behave if we aren't nice to it in a month.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. By the way, since- wait.

[Speaker 6]
Since I awakened it, can I still tame it?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, thank god, okay.

[Speaker 1]
It'll just be more like a- Compaction. It'll be more like a- yeah, like a- Okay. Like a higher-layer henchman relationship.

[Speaker 6]
What's its AC?

[Speaker 1]
It'll be 10 plus its dexterity. You know what? I think it'll have higher dex on account of all the extra legs.

So you could set that to 15.

[Speaker 6]
15, okay. Yeah, I could buy some barding and- Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 7]
Exactly.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, and I- I'll be right back. Like, I mount it. I mount the sick 8-dex.

Legged horse.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. I'm gonna write a note on the 29th of the next month to indicate when the charm wears off.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. It's still not hostile, but it's just neutral.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, I'll give him a good fairy too. Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Did you say a knife?

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 1]
I thought you said, I give him a knife.

[Speaker 6]
A knife? A good- A good- Wait, can he wield a knife?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, what a shame. Yeah, no, he- See, it's not as bad now.

[Speaker 1]
All right, we're gonna take- We're gonna take like a 10-minute break, and then we're gonna come back, and we're gonna get back into the adventure, all right? Because Ansem's gonna have some info for you.

[Speaker 8]
All right.

[Speaker 6]
Of course, of course. By the way, like- Cool. I have like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9- I have 10 cantrips.

It takes forever to scroll through them all.

[Speaker 4]
Oh wow.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I have multi-classing problems.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, that makes sense.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I have cleric, sorcerer, and druid. So it's three from each, and then one next- Multi-class three classes? Damn.

I am- I'm planning to multi-class five times on the other one.

[Speaker 1]
What kind of game?

[Speaker 6]
Oh wow.

[Speaker 1]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, no, I applaud that.

[Speaker 6]
That's- Yeah, no, I- My favorite passage whenever I play with an UDM is the one which says, you know, through multi-classing you can like realize character concepts that are outside the normal mechanics, because no way in hell I'm justifying sorcerer, cleric, ranger- Sorcerer, cleric, druid in one character, you know?

[Speaker 1]
It's- the easiest part to me is the- There we go. Oh, that's right, he was- The horse didn't have the pan, it was the- The horse did have the knife.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Because Rider had the pan.

[Speaker 1]
Fleeing. Fleeing Rider.

[Speaker 2]
I was so mad at that name reveal.

[Speaker 4]
Eugene? You don't like Eugene? I dated a Eugene.

That's right, you did.

[Speaker 1]
My bad.

[Speaker 6]
I have never seen someone with that name, unironically.

[Speaker 1]
Eugene? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Fucking Mr. Krabs, isn't that his name?

[Speaker 2]
Eugene Krabs. Is it? Yeah, the Eugene I knew was the guy- Yes, it is Eugene.

Um, the Eugene I knew was the guy who, uh, in school would always eat just straight-up crackers with an entire packet of mayonnaise per cracker.

[Speaker 8]
Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
He never came to the wait, so- I mean, you looked at this person and said, I should date them.

[Speaker 4]
Because mayonnaise was on that.

[Speaker 2]
This was in middle school, and I never really agreed to date him. I just was for some reason.

[Speaker 3]
Crackers? Oh, Jesus. Some people, they don't deserve the sacredness that is life.

[Speaker 1]
I should write this down. I want to figure it out later. We met at the Forobbins Causeway about, uh, what was it?

[Speaker 6]
Four years ago now, and- I mean, this is actually pretty good. Then I can get a macro sorted, so it doesn't take a year for me to count your aliments. There we go.

Save macro.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
So I like that especially that the- I like especially that the- like, the D20 just goes off. Because one thing that we try to encourage a lot of the new players especially, is like, hey, just roll the thing first. Don't worry about modifiers.

After, like, you know, if you get, like, a 20, then it's probably not going to matter all that much. Whatever the modifiers are, we could just move on.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I mean, there's not much point in rolling if a 20 isn't a success in my opinion. Or, I mean, unless you're contesting, of course. I hope I did.

Okay, good, good, good. Are you good- Is anyone here good at the Foundry macros?

[Speaker 4]
I would assume Otter is. Uh, what are you trying to do?

[Speaker 6]
I'm trying to make it so that if something beats a- like, if something beats a target number, it rolls. But otherwise it doesn't. But yeah, I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
It's like you're trying to make it so it- But I- Can you reword that sentence?

[Speaker 6]
So I'm trying to make it so that if a previous roll exceeds a target number, it rolls a different roll.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I think you can do that.

[Speaker 6]
But I think you can just labor it under them, so here we go.

[Speaker 8]
5 points.

[Speaker 2]
1d4. Uh, you could do it the silly way and make a, um, and make a table for it. Because you can roll dice in the tables.

[Speaker 6]
But, um, Yeah, I'll look into that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't remember the chat commands off the top of my head, but that would be a chat command. Um, and I've got Foundry up, so I can look into it.

[Speaker 6]
Here we go, okay. This actually works now, because then every animal's- Yeah, yeah, this works. This works.

Okay, good. Because you can roll dice. have like the big score, the 1d20, and then under it you have two different attacks, and then under it you have the attacks.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just gonna scroll a little further down here. Yeah, there it is. Okay.

All right, then I am just about ready to jump back into things here. I'm gonna go wash my hands. And mix that up.

[Speaker 3]
Well then I'll go put a thing in the microwave and then come back and go get it whenever it's done.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not eating today.

[Speaker 2]
Um yeah, I don't think this is quite what I'm thinking, but this is the dice modifiers page on Foundry. There is a thing that counts successes, and you can tell it what a success is. Okay.

But I don't think it sets it to roll. I think the roll table is going to be your best bet for having it do that.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I will look into it tomorrow. This will do nicely. I think I can interpret this in like 20 seconds and add it all up.

Apparently it shouldn't take too long. And I think like selecting spells and stuff is going to take more time. Are you people down here down for stealthing, by the way?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I am back. Every stealth roll I have rolled has been under a 10, and I have rolled quite a few stealth rolls.

[Speaker 6]
So that will tell you. I can cast pass without trace at will. It's plus 10.

[Speaker 2]
Every time I've had a pass without trace, I have gotten... Every time I've done pass without trace, it's pretty much like I get a 15.

[Speaker 3]
Are we sneaking?

[Speaker 4]
A few people are down for it. I am a rogue scout. Stealth is my jam.

[Speaker 2]
We are also in a giant caravan, so unless we're breaking off from the group, stealthing isn't really going to be too useful, I don't think.

[Speaker 4]
Why have we brought the giant caravan with us? I assumed we left it behind to go look for the building, but...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I think James misunderstood because he had us going on the trail with the caravan, I think.

[Speaker 4]
Eh, it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Where did you leave the caravan behind?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we did leave the caravan. Okay. No, I mean, we...

I don't care. I don't care. I figured if we left it, it would be when we're going to go scout some place.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
But if...

[Speaker 1]
No, that's totally... I mean, it's got like... It's got a unit of Boggarts protecting it right now.

[Speaker 8]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
And then we can just...

[Speaker 4]
We can tuck it here for now.

[Speaker 1]
The priest... I assume the priest and the researchers right now are just going over the different shrines that they find in the area.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, I forgot they were a bunch of nerds.

[Speaker 1]
Well, once you guys get back to civilization, they'll be able to make you a fair bit of money.

[Speaker 2]
How many Boggarts were there?

[Speaker 1]
There were a total of 20 plus one so basically a unit of them.

[Speaker 5]
Can you guys hear background noise right now?

[Speaker 1]
A little bit, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh dear. You guys are listening to a movie on my end for a while. Not like it was loud, but for whatever reason, my mic picked it up.

[Speaker 6]
My quick mute seems to have stopped working on the headset, so yeah, this grid is kind of awkward with it. I will try to mute the phone.

[Speaker 2]
I think we're just doing a small break. I think we're going to be getting in the scene again.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to wash my hands and then we're going to get back to it.

[Speaker 2]
I was considering if I wanted to give some of the Boggarts some herbs before we left, but I would only be giving them five and I don't want them to fight over them.

[Speaker 3]
Can you imagine?

[Speaker 2]
Like all those videos of a child breaking open a pinata and just unleashing the flood of child. Bonnie, you're going to fly between my desk.

[Speaker 5]
What? What have you guys been doing so far? I didn't realize there'd been a session today.

Oh, we've just been exploring mostly.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we found an eight-legged horse.

[Speaker 6]
An eight-legged horse? Yeah, and I have charmed it. Existentialism.

[Speaker 3]
Can it walk on walls?

[Speaker 6]
Is it a spider?

[Speaker 3]
We haven't tested that out yet.

[Speaker 6]
Maybe. Wait, isn't there a spell for it?

[Speaker 5]
Is there only one way to find out?

[Speaker 2]
No, we're trying to find Mimosa's grandmother's tower. Which the horse might have information about, so we're eagerly waiting, James.

[Speaker 4]
Waiting for it to be haunted as fuck.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, I wish I hadn't missed it then. Good luck.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, do you have an extra character? I mean, yes, technically. Well, I don't see why not.

[Speaker 2]
You can see if James will let you just drop in, literally.

[Speaker 4]
I think we have about two and a half more hours, technically, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's almost 12 for us, and you need to leave at, what, two? Yeah, you guys will probably have... I'm trying to find someone to cover my shift, but yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Then it's fine, because if you're ending in, like, what, an hour, and you're all tired, it's all right.

[Speaker 1]
I don't mind if just somebody jumps in for a minute. Hello.

[Speaker 3]
I heard there's an eight-legged horse.

[Speaker 1]
There is!

[Speaker 3]
You brought up a good point. Can it climb walls? Yeah, yeah, I brought that up.

Is it like a spider horse?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I think it's just inspired by the whole Slipney-er myth.

[Speaker 3]
I am going to AI generate a horse with spider legs.

[Speaker 1]
Does this go spider climb?

[Speaker 4]
Is that only on the person casting it?

[Speaker 1]
You can target somebody else to spider climb.

[Speaker 4]
Well, there we go. It's because we need to find a scenario where we can do that.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna spoiler this, but I did find a couple of spider horses. Wait, actually, like, oh my god, people are...

[Speaker 6]
See, this is why we don't deserve the internet.

[Speaker 2]
This is why we deserve the internet.

[Speaker 3]
Not like, it's so disgusting. Oh, that's awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, man.

[Speaker 3]
These are great. That is so cool. Can you imagine how terrifying that would be in real life, though?

That would be very strange. That would be very terrifying. Ew, and that one has the abdomen of a...

[Speaker 2]
It's awful. I mean... A ten ridiculous...

Dungeons and Dragons enemies, you won't believe they exist. Spider horse was a Dungeons and Dragons thing?

[Speaker 4]
Huh. From the very beginning.

[Speaker 2]
We came full circle, gang. I feel like this has to be something that someone made, and it just so happens to be, like, an old stat block. No, it was made as a combo monster, like Owlbear, in the Dragon Magazine 243.

[Speaker 4]
Huh. I want to be in that room with the creator going, I have something, it's kind of like the Owlbear, but better or more awesome, and it's just a spider horse, and everyone...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, but better. Everyone's just like, Owlbear. I hate to break it to you, but you're fired.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And then this is one of my other favorite video, or images. I need an Anandi that is a cowboy.

[Speaker 5]
A what? That's a cow? Hold on, let's look.

Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
In Pathfinder, there is a race of spiders called the Anandi. Are they playable? They are playable.

[Speaker 3]
I need to play. I need to play Pathfinder.

[Speaker 1]
Y'all need to play Pathfinder.

[Speaker 2]
Anandi? Anandi, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Every time I hear something about Pathfinder, it gets so much cooler.

[Speaker 8]
They're like peacock spiders.

[Speaker 6]
There are like spider people in D&D too, but they are like less spider and more people. They have three shapes. They can be human, they can be...

I didn't... They can be like riders, but not riders, and then they can be full spiders.

[Speaker 2]
These ones are kind of the same way, they can be human or spider, but...

[Speaker 3]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
But I love them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, you know what? I really like spiders, like I genuinely love spiders. And it makes me so sad that people are just part of them.

Favorite spider? Jumping spiders, definitely. Oh, those are great, yeah.

Very, very jumpy. They're very jumpy, but very friendly.

[Speaker 2]
I am a fan of jumping. I love peacock spiders. Um, I have a special fondness for them.

But I do also like tarantulas, but you will never see me touch one.

[Speaker 3]
I want a blue tarantula. Of course, if you drop them, they explode. And if they shoot that, they shoot spikes at you.

So... What? They explode, like, everywhere.

Well, they don't like... Not like a mushroom cloud kind of explosion, but just like a... Just, they break apart.

They just die. Yeah, no, I understood what you meant by explode, and I'm like, oh, that's unpleasant and unfortunate. Ooh, peacock spiders are gorgeous.

I don't know, I didn't know that's what they were called. I love jumping spiders.

[Speaker 5]
Have you seen, like, the size of birdeater spiders? No, I wouldn't want to do that. Okay, just, like, search up Goliath birdeater.

Those are the biggest, biggest ones.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

[Speaker 2]
Weirdly, the larger the spider, the less I'm afraid of it. But, like, there's kind of, like, a scale. When they're really small, I don't mind them.

But when they're really big, it's like, oh, that's just puppy. But there's, like, this sweet spot of, dear God, that's going to kill me.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I saw one spider that was, like, it could have fit in the palm of my hand. And it had a bunch of babies on top. And I nearly shit myself.

I respect and love all of nature. And, you know, good for her. She's doing her own great motherly maternal stuff.

She can do it away from me. She can be a spider mom away from me.

[Speaker 2]
I had a cute flower on my microphone that was just there for the sake of being there. And a spider laid eggs in it. And all of a sudden, I had spider babies all over my desk.

And I was freaking out about it. And I found out that there was an egg in there. And it had hatched.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 2]
So I had to throw the babies away.

[Speaker 3]
We had a bunch of tiny, itty-bitty spiders that kind of infested our living room at one point. Well, they didn't infest. They were just, like, in the lamp.

But they were so tiny, they did not even bother us. They did not bother us. And we just didn't get rid of them.

They were just little spiders. And they eventually just went away. That's good.

That's great. You had roommates for a bit. I do like coexisting with spiders.

Because they get rid of other insects that we don't like. And I trust spiders a lot more than I trust other bugs. Fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
All righty.

[Speaker 3]
That's how I feel about geckos in the house. It's just like, oh, okay, well.

[Speaker 5]
Don't squish it. As long as you eat bugs. Squish what?

I said don't squish it. Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, you don't squish geckos.

You just sort of let them chill in your house. And they eat bugs for you, which is nice.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Is everybody ready to go underground?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah. Let's fight some giant spiders.

[Speaker 1]
Would be very fitting.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, all right, then. Um, well, I'll read the session summary after you guys are done, then.

[Speaker 1]
Enjoy. I can. Absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
You can, like, fall out of a crevice in, like, a tree or something. Just be here. Okay.

Which of my characters are free?

[Speaker 5]
I'm pretty sure both should be, but I'm not 100% sure.

[Speaker 1]
Probably the necromancer would be a little easier to justify coming here. Yeah, that makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, you said we're going underground. Where are we going? Like, what's the entrance?

[Speaker 1]
All right. So, uh, y'all are talking with Anzer to answer some questions.

[Speaker 4]
Hehehe. I have this map, or any of it.

[Speaker 1]
On this map. Oh, we're on the far right. Somebody will direct you to it.

In the meantime, okay. So, what are you going to start asking Anzer here?

[Speaker 3]
Wait, what are we looking for exactly? A tower.

[Speaker 6]
Have you seen a tower nearby?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes, I have.

[Speaker 6]
Would you mind showing us the way there?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so here's the thing. I can't quite reach it onto my usual trail, and I haven't liked going around the mountain for some time. Something's blocked off the trail I used to get around them, so I've been stuck here for a little while.

But I do have a little bit of an underground trail that goes underneath this mountain. And if you could help me pass this blockage, then on the other side, you will see a large tower.

[Speaker 6]
There's a blockage of stone?

[Speaker 1]
Not quite. It's a settlement of sorts.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Settlement of undead?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it used to be, I don't quite know, really. Pointy eared, dark skinned, for the most part. A few albinos.

[Speaker 4]
Do they all have white hair?

[Speaker 1]
For the most part.

[Speaker 2]
Might be drow.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, do they come out during the day?

[Speaker 1]
They live in places like that, but this one is unoccupied. But I must have tripped over something or activated something like latching the gate behind me by accident. Because the gate shut behind me on accident.

I don't know how to open it again. And I can't climb up the wall.

[Speaker 8]
Can you jump it?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 4]
We would love to help you out. Yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
I'd be happy to join you. It sure does make asking for help a lot easier with a tongue to use and vocal cords or something. I'd be gifted with language.

I don't quite know how. I'm not going to pretend to know the specifics.

[Speaker 3]
It's magic. For things going to get existential eventually. That's what happens to all animals that awaken.

They realize they're mortal.

[Speaker 1]
This grass still tastes pretty nice though, so I'll be just fine.

[Speaker 6]
We appreciate your help.

[Speaker 1]
Of course.

[Speaker 6]
If you need anything, bring to let us know. Or please let us know.

[Speaker 1]
I will. I will. I assume I'm traveling with you.

[Speaker 6]
If you don't mind.

[Speaker 1]
All right. I'll be able to lead the way and hopefully prevent us from getting lost by this nature. It's just past a little illusory opening.

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So y'all are going to go to the top of this particular hex. Back where... It's right back at the point that...

Let's see here. Malved had previously seen this particular... Yeah, it's right back at the point where Malved had seen this illusion.

Along the way, you notice the statue of... Let's see here. Who was here for Colleen's ballad?

[Speaker 3]
Can you remind me of what the ballad was?

[Speaker 1]
That was when you guys went into the City of the Dead.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. Pero was there for that one. I think Mimosa was for two.

[Speaker 4]
I don't remember.

[Speaker 1]
But I think it was Keras. It might have been Keras, yeah. So Pero and Mimosa will recognize a shrine to Colleen or the representation of Colleen.

As you're passing by, a skull appears that's similarly elongated to Colleen's and adorned with a bunch of crap. Just bone crap. Little trinkets and fetishes woven out of bone.

Adorning it. And it kind of spits out a person.

[Speaker 4]
A what? Oh. Excuse me?

[Speaker 1]
If you would like to introduce the good part.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
So I've just been spat out by what exactly?

[Speaker 1]
You are interacting with a shrine on the other side of the map and you were trying to use it in order to find what you thought was powerful undead. You misinteracted with the shrine and you were spat out on this side. I have no idea where you are.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I see. I can't see where in the map right now, but that's fine. I'll just sort of dust myself off and be like...

[Speaker 3]
I look up and I'm just like... Are we all just gathered around? Yeah.

Kibi's like her fur is like all puffy. It's all coming out of like different crevices of her armor. Wait, she doesn't have armor on.

She's a barbarian. I don't!

[Speaker 5]
No! I'm just wearing like a regular suit and I'm just disheveled and I'm just like...

[Speaker 4]
Are you all right? I will be perfectly all right soon.

[Speaker 5]
I sort of just look around. Few minutes. Where am I?

[Speaker 8]
Oh!

[Speaker 3]
Well, since no one else knows where we are...

[Speaker 4]
Where were you to begin with? I don't think this area has a name, so...

[Speaker 3]
It's called Search Area.

[Speaker 4]
Well, yes.

[Speaker 3]
It's above the, you know, the orange part.

[Speaker 4]
We're in a search area? We're northwest of Sierra's Keep. Yeah, that's...

yeah. It's above the orange blob on the map. We're about a week from Sierra's Keep, right?

[Speaker 3]
A week! Oh, that's...

[Speaker 5]
Wow, that is plenty far. He sort of just looks around. He's just like, how did you manage to get here?

Same issue?

[Speaker 4]
No, we walked here. Yeah, well, no. We didn't walk here.

We have a caravan that brought us here. But we did walk to this specific place.

[Speaker 7]
Well, I see. Uh, what...

[Speaker 5]
Do you know how one might be able to go back through this thing? Or would it be best to just come along?

[Speaker 2]
Well, if you're willing to travel with us, I could teleport you at some point.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that works.

[Speaker 2]
He sort of just shrugs and he's just like, well, that's it. You'll have to wait till we're done, because I'd have to go with you.

[Speaker 4]
But... No worries. I'm about to cast Prestidigitation on you to remove all your dirt.

[Speaker 5]
And he's just like, thank you very much. I could have taken care of it myself, but I really appreciate that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Welcome to the group. Yippee!

[Speaker 5]
Now I just have to find where you are on the map.

[Speaker 2]
Can any of you, like, paint the area?

[Speaker 5]
Do you know where Sierra's Keep is?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. If you go to Sierra's Keep and you follow that line going from Sierra's Keep around the sun, you'll kind of go up. There's another line you can take and that will lead you directly to us.

[Speaker 5]
Is it that circle of orange lines? The pit?

[Speaker 8]
Uh, that went down.

[Speaker 4]
You're gonna go... Yeah, northeast. We were not joking when we said northeast.

North! Yeah. And then we are up here.

Okay, line from Sierra's Keep.

[Speaker 5]
Near the mountains. Anywhere near the mountains?

[Speaker 2]
In the mountains, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We're pretty much like- Oh, there you are. Okay. Yep, found it.

Thank you. All right, here.

[Speaker 4]
There we go. All right. All right.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, this has been a little... Uh, this Aurora Signature. What are Aurora Signatures?

[Speaker 2]
They're like fancy places to explore.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's mostly there, we found out. Where's Petlin?

[Speaker 2]
Alton? I know I went to one. I have no idea what was there.

I don't remember. No, it was the cabin! It was the cabin where we found the cool funky mirror in the cloud forest.

Yeah, that's right.

[Speaker 1]
Could that be where the tower is? No, it was not the cabin.

[Speaker 4]
Or is it its own- No, it was the cabin. We are not near the cloud. Forest.

Oh, right. Is that what this is?

[Speaker 1]
Cloud forest is on the other side of the valley.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, and we would probably have died, so...

[Speaker 3]
Is it a forest of clouds, I assume? Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Your character's been there.

[Speaker 3]
I have, yeah. I just don't remember the...

[Speaker 2]
It had the hide behinds.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
The area's signature critter. We are currently following a horse who might know where the tower is.

[Speaker 4]
An eight-legged horse with no opposable thumbs.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I see- He needs us to open a gate. I do need additional assistance in opening this gate. I don't mind additional hangers on, additional cover.

[Speaker 5]
I sort of just- I sort of lean towards them, being like, what is it that we're up to?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, see, my grandmother messed with this tower to some degree, and I'm trying to figure out what and what is in it.

[Speaker 5]
I see. So off to the tower we go, then? Yep.

Hopefully. Hopefully it's not cursed.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, we'll see. So the very thing I rolled up was a potent leyline. You guys have spent about two days traveling through the...

That's where Ansel's charm works off. That one is for... Yeah, there we go.

Party enters the world below.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm. Fun. Has there been...

Has the sun gone up since I casted Awakened?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, though you guys won't be able to see it for some time.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, but the staff regains charges in that case.

[Speaker 1]
So you guys travel underneath of the... There we go. You guys are going to travel underneath of this illusion here.

You are immediately greeted by a swirling pattern of rocks, all of which are floating in some capacity. And as Ansel progresses forward, a lot of the rocks sort of align themselves into his path. Not perfectly, and he does occasionally stumble.

Basically difficult terrain. But it does allow you guys to progress way, way quicker into the world below. So quickly, in fact, that you feel a pressure change after you've exited this swirling rockway.

Swirling tunnel, I guess you could say. All of a sudden, like, your sinuses clear out. Your hearing goes dull for a moment as your body adjusts to the new pressure.

A few times swallowing or chewing or just exercising your... Jaw gets rid of it. But you feel as if you've changed elevation extremely quickly.

[Speaker 8]
I hate that.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee gives off, like, a massive yawn.

[Speaker 2]
It triggers a yawn chain.

[Speaker 8]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
All right, you are in the Underdark. As you guys move forward, there is this little... Well, it almost looks like lava.

It's like a line of lava that just kind of spreads out from the horse and moves forward. But it is green in color. It's green in color?

It starts off near the horse. It's a line. It kind of looks...

It's liquid in form. It kind of looks like lava. And so far as the viscosity and how far it's moving, but it's green.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Does it seem hot? Like lava?

[Speaker 1]
Feels charged, the touch. Like there's static electricity hugging to your finger after you touch it.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, I... I poke Para.

[Speaker 3]
As one does.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Yeah? Poke me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Poke Keebee. I do it again and poke Keebee.

[Speaker 1]
All of Keebee's fur just at once.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee is just giggling.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I'm gonna make an arcana check to check what's- Oh! Okay, well. Let's check what's up with it.

[Speaker 1]
What's up with the weird lava? You're on a leyline.

[Speaker 2]
A rather potent- Oh hey, I also made them green and look like lava. You do leylines? I had a leyline in one of my other campaigns.

[Speaker 8]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I believe I also touched it, right?

[Speaker 2]
I think you were a little more cautious and you touched it with a stick and- I think I made this- I think I rolled and the stick exploded, but- Oh yeah, okay. Speaking of poking it with a stick, can I throw a torch into it? Not a lit torch, just an unlit torch.

I don't have a stick. I guess I could throw a crossbow bowl. Oh well, torch is fine.

[Speaker 1]
I said torch. It gets into, uh, it starts lighting up as per like a continual flame.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
So are we planning on crossing this thing? Oh, we need to, do we?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you guys are. It's just a thin little line that's going towards your destination.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well let's follow it.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 8]
There we go then.

[Speaker 1]
You guys move on for about, let's see here. Who is going to be camping and, let's see here, camping, fishing, foraging, and all that good stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, definitely Kibi. Oh, we are exploring in the Underdark.

[Speaker 3]
I think Kibi has darkvision, right?

[Speaker 5]
She should. Is the notes for the camping thing again? It's description.

[Speaker 1]
That is in exploration if you go to journal. Chilmus Valley DDF.

[Speaker 7]
Chilmus Valley DDF.

[Speaker 1]
Uh oh. There you go.

[Speaker 6]
How much XP did I get for the deer, uh, the eight-legged horse?

[Speaker 1]
We'll go over that soon.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Oh, we can do it after, so yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So I think it's, uh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Do we need hunting stuff? It's, yeah, it's completely fine.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody who does the hunting, it's going to be based off the results.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so hunting. So that's nature and then survival.

[Speaker 1]
Would this be a forageable area or? Sure. There's plenty of mushrooms and other nonsense in the Underdark.

[Speaker 2]
I love the idea of a foraging Underdark critter things. Not critter things. Plant things.

There might be a living mushroom. Who knows?

[Speaker 3]
Well, it wouldn't be the first time we've run into them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. What did I get?

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. That's good. All right, Mal, but it looks like you've got two successes here for hunting.

And then Kibi, what did you get?

[Speaker 3]
I got, well, I, um, doing them one at a time. I got an 18 for preparation. And survival.

Kibi, survival.

[Speaker 2]
Are we doing all the rolls?

[Speaker 3]
All that I have.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you guys will spend, let's see here. I guess it is just about two days worth of travel.

[Speaker 3]
And then I passed survival. Now I have to pause, which is constitution. I'm good at.

[Speaker 1]
Here, just do two of the rolls because you guys are traveling for two days under this thing. And those could be whichever stage you want. Whichever one is, uh.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I definitely passed two stages at least.

[Speaker 1]
All righty.

[Speaker 3]
I got two successes too, right?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. So would you like a rare or two commons?

[Speaker 8]
Rare.

[Speaker 1]
And then Para, you've got one success on there and then you've got one failure.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Uh, re-rollable or?

[Speaker 1]
In this area, I think you would need somebody to help you out with some dice.

[Speaker 7]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 1]
Guys, we'll not. These rolls. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want me to roll a d20 then for the, uh, result? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Me too.

[Speaker 8]
I forgot the roll.

[Speaker 2]
No, that was accidental. I just rolled 20. I forgot to put the d.

[Speaker 6]
I rolled two, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Um, you guys let me know if you're doing rare or whatever common. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know why it says Ziri. I changed that ages ago, but you know.

[Speaker 2]
Um, it's probably because on this map she's still called Ziri.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. So we just, ah, so we just roll a d20 for this?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so the, what are you doing? Um. I, I'm not.

For exploration.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not, I'm not sure which jobs are free to do at the moment, so.

[Speaker 1]
I think we've got two people hunting. We've got one person doing survivalist, which also includes foraging.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. Okay. So two hunters, one survivalist.

I'll go and see what else is there.

[Speaker 1]
And you're a wizard, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yep. So I'm looking at the wizard results.

[Speaker 2]
Technically, by the, um, the rules of exploration, um, it gives me four cleric. There's like a pillar of smoke guiding us to the destination. I don't know if that works in a cave.

[Speaker 1]
That'd be fun.

[Speaker 6]
It's a magic double smoke.

[Speaker 2]
I could- It turns into a fire at the end of the day.

[Speaker 5]
I could attempt at cooking, since that would give advantage on, uh, magical effects. And, oh, but it's, is it while resting? When it says while resting, does it mean, like, only during the rest, or?

[Speaker 1]
That means during the rest, yeah. So if somebody interrupts your rest with, like, a fireball or something, then you'll be resistant to all the damage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
What does a six give me? Horrible, horrible, though.

[Speaker 1]
What did you get?

[Speaker 6]
All right, so- Better than a two.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you rolled for two commons.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no, one rare.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you rolled twice.

[Speaker 6]
I did that before. I thought- Okay, let's take the lowest one. That's fair, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the reason you rolled twice before was because you got a result that gave you two results. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, so it's a two.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so we've got a two for rare.

[Speaker 3]
That's two twos for rare. Rare.

[Speaker 1]
All right, you both find a mist mole.

[Speaker 3]
I have an idea.

[Speaker 1]
It is a small creature about the size of a dog. It digs through small pockets of the Underdark and then closes them back up. And it's able to- It's able to turn itself into mist to go between these tunnels.

[Speaker 3]
Not anymore. Not anymore.

[Speaker 5]
Is there any water of which I could fish in? I will sacrifice it.

[Speaker 1]
Good thing. Um, there is, actually. There's quite a few different, uh, cave fishing areas.

[Speaker 5]
Sweet.

[Speaker 1]
I will attempt at doing that.

[Speaker 5]
Would I roll nature of cancer survival?

[Speaker 1]
Um. Instructions for that are in just choose two stages from the fishing instructions and natural acquisitions. That's the downtime PDF.

[Speaker 5]
Downtime, natural acquisitions. Oh, here we go, fishing.

[Speaker 1]
All right, then, sorry, Mimosa, what were you saying?

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um, I can do survivalist. Oh.

Which keeps us from getting lost.

[Speaker 1]
But no, we're following a deer. Exactly. I think what's-her-face has survivalist right now.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. And then someone's already cooking food?

[Speaker 2]
Um, I think they went to go fish instead.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then I will cook. Why not? Where are my cook utensils?

[Speaker 8]
Heh. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that should add your proficiency bonus because you should be proficient in it.

[Speaker 3]
We'll be right back once more.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Um, okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's okay. You guys aren't going to get- it doesn't matter too much. You guys aren't going to get affected by other encounters until you reach your destination.

Um, isn't the stuff that I rolled earlier? Do you come across an area- Sorry. Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sorry. I was saying I rolled for fishing, but part of the fishing thing means you have to roll a 1d6.

[Speaker 1]
What that is. Go ahead and roll 1d6. I know what you're talking about.

Okay, I'll- All right, and then just mark down that you got a 5 because I think that- That's the next time you can get it.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right, we're gonna take another just short 10 minute break to let Kiwi come back. And then we're switching to a different scene.

[Speaker 3]
Where are we going? What are we doing?

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna stop for 10 minutes so I can grab a quick snack. All righty. And then we are going into a different scene.

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful.

[Speaker 2]
I need to go somewhere. Fallen, did you see what I put in the chat? Um, so when you're traveling and you're not in a city- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

Yeah. Uh, I just wanted to make sure you knew that.

[Speaker 6]
I'm a prime podcaster, so.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And I didn't, uh, yes, so it should be, like, equal to my level.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Um, of a combined level. So, like, if you're doing second level spell slots- Oh, yeah, yeah.

That reduces it too.

[Speaker 1]
And then I gotta call somebody back. That's probably the main reason this is going on. I'm just getting calls about, uh, which place we're moving into later this month.

[Speaker 6]
Might as well snack be in the car.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any other gams- uh, gams? Games planned?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I think there was some talk about a, um, game on Saturday, but I don't think I saw anyone say that they were, uh, actually gonna plan it. I just know that, um, some people were chatting about it in the, uh, session times. Before we did the, um, Thursday one.

Oh, this Saturday, um, James is doing a, like, group talk of stuff.

[Speaker 4]
There's a big meeting in Sierra's Keep for all of us to gather information for each other.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, I actually think I have to uninterest in that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 2]
Because we're doing werewolf. No, it's early in the day, right? I won't be available because I'm working.

Oh, shit. I have to touch people all day.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, you do.

[Speaker 5]
I just missed part of the conversation and only quite heard, I have to touch people all day.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was talking about the fact that I have to work.

[Speaker 3]
I think the word is masseuse, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
How is that? I've always been interested in that.

[Speaker 2]
I actually really enjoy doing massage, um, and apparently I'm pretty good at it. Um, I got a $27 tip, uh, $27 tip yesterday because somebody was really happy with their shoulder massage.

[Speaker 4]
You've massaged me before.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, she always drools.

[Speaker 4]
I do. You always make me drool. I'm not a drooler.

It's not easy to make me drool.

[Speaker 8]
That's so cute.

[Speaker 4]
She just makes you drool. You got to pick one, dude. You can't have both.

No. Which one do you want? I'm going to give you the almond joy.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, he's muted.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. You know, a bunch of things are, uh, what should we call it? I was expecting the random encounters to be, uh, harsher out this way.

Or like, provide us with a couple of combats and the circumstances did not align. That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
It's my magic aura.

[Speaker 5]
Just alert by the sheer energy you emit.

[Speaker 1]
When did I place that there?

[Speaker 2]
You're so sleepy, buddy.

[Speaker 1]
This is going to take a hot minute to upload. There we go. Okay.

Yeah, we're not going to do token vision or fog exploration here. Oh, one more note. The leyline that you guys were interacting with earlier today was a, and it's currently on this line, is a, it's just a skein line.

All spells are cast at one level higher than the slot expended. So we're on that effect.

[Speaker 8]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
That is correct. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
That's, that's great. If we come back this way, I want to, I want to see if I can put it in a vial.

[Speaker 4]
That's what I was going to ask. Try to put it in a jar and then give it to Morgan. Can we drink a leyline?

[Speaker 1]
No, it doesn't really take out leg pieces.

[Speaker 8]
I think that would be a bad idea.

[Speaker 1]
There are people who are specialized in this. They're called leg keepers.

[Speaker 8]
In eating leylines? Are any of you leg keepers?

[Speaker 1]
Or something like that. Sorry, what did you say?

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I was just, I was just wondering if anyone in the party was a leg keeper, because that's a secondary class you can take.

[Speaker 4]
You have to be intelligent for that, right?

[Speaker 3]
Or at least just be able to feel the vibes, you know?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi totally thinks she could, she could feel the vibes.

[Speaker 2]
All right, where do you want us to put them?

[Speaker 1]
You can put them in, right at the bottom here. There we go. This section, yeah, there you go.

[Speaker 3]
Don't put it in the right spot.

[Speaker 1]
There's a large gate in front of this, like there's an enclosure, right? Right over here, opens up into something that has some actual flooring to it. And there's a large gate barring access to the further interior here.

[Speaker 3]
It's, it's slightly off-center. Ever so slightly. Can't wait to kick ass in here, if that's what we're doing.

[Speaker 4]
Whoops, sorry, Peridot.

[Speaker 2]
Why do you always put yourself right on top of me?

[Speaker 8]
I like this game.

[Speaker 4]
I, my aim is really bad. I was genuinely aiming for right below you. Uh, we also lost someone, they had to leave.

Oh, who'd we? Fallen. Please don't do that.

[Speaker 5]
Walk away. Right on ya.

[Speaker 2]
All right, um, I guess examine the gate. Does it look like a normal gate? Oh, I'm on the ruler.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me an investigation chair.

[Speaker 2]
Why don't you make me use intelligence?

[Speaker 1]
Or an arcana.

[Speaker 2]
It's also intelligence! Which is all, yes, I was rubbing it in.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, you did pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
Definitely seems like it was activated by something magical. There's a little rune on the keyhole.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone know their runes? No. Good try.

[Speaker 8]
Is there anyone?

[Speaker 5]
Would that be also another, um, arcana? I kind of checked it. Okay, one moment.

[Speaker 1]
Also, what's everybody's passive investigation?

[Speaker 8]
14. Nine.

[Speaker 5]
How do you check your, uh, passive?

[Speaker 2]
So when you're looking at your attributes, um, there's like a number in some parentheses and it's kind of grayed out. That's your passive. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 2]
It's basically just your modifier plus 10.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. 15.

[Speaker 1]
You'll actually notice a corresponding rune on one of the side panels here. And it's made for a human hand. Oh, that's not worrying at all.

A humanoid hand, I should say.

[Speaker 5]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, not terrible, but. I'm pretty confident you just have to touch it and the thing will open.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I... I put a hand to it. Very cautiously though, just like.

[Speaker 1]
All right, cuts your hand off now. Um, it opens the gate.

[Speaker 8]
Jesus. Yay.

[Speaker 5]
Good job. Like, that was harrowing. I had a weird voice in my head.

Just gave me a weird vision of my hand being severed. Anyway.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just gonna go, Kibi! Kibi. Right, um.

Give you a little, come here, kissies.

[Speaker 3]
So she runs in.

[Speaker 1]
There's a bunch of, uh, dead Vegeta pygmies as you enter. There's a bunch of dead Vegeta pygmies off to the right side. They're just kind of in a, uh, in a pile.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Some dead what's? Veg-a-pygmies.

[Speaker 1]
Veg-a-pygmies. They're like critters made out of plant material and mushrooms.

[Speaker 3]
I was gonna give him a sniff, but maybe not.

[Speaker 1]
Ed comments that he was using them to, he was snacking on them. And there's not as much greenery in the Underdark, so he had to go to something that was as close to grass as he could find.

[Speaker 3]
How long have these things been dead?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they come back every, um, every two days or so.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a window anywhere?

[Speaker 1]
Not in here, no.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, um.

[Speaker 1]
Well, facing outwards, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, Kibi's gonna throw him out.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
They come back, I, I don't want them to, like, reanimate or some, some bullshit like that, so. Throw about, throw about a window.

[Speaker 2]
Put them in a compost pile.

[Speaker 5]
Speaking of reanimation, would, would, would, would Animate Dead work on them?

[Speaker 1]
Animate Dead is intended to work on humanoids.

[Speaker 5]
Humanoids, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
But if you wanted to do a little bit of spell research, then, you know, passing it on to an intelligent plant would be in the, would be in the okay.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so spell research first, though. All right, I'll do that once I've completed spell research. Right here, then.

Anything up with the plant?

[Speaker 1]
We could just do this. Yeah, the rest of this building is empty, except for the gateway that leads outside.

[Speaker 4]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Does it also have a room?

[Speaker 1]
This one was opened by the previous entry.

[Speaker 2]
Some little cages. What does the guy we're following look like? A horse with eight legs.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's, that's the one who's talking. Yeah, yeah, it's Awakened. Ah, I thought that was, I thought that was another person.

Okay. Nope. That makes more sense to why he couldn't enter the build.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Why he had the opposable thumbs.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, that's, I was wondering why that was specified.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, are we allowed in these?

[Speaker 1]
What are these? They're all buildings. They'll, they do have doors of their own on them.

They all feel really cold to the touch. Your breath here is visible.

[Speaker 3]
Just a nice box. So it's cold?

[Speaker 4]
The boxes are cold. Yeah. Okay, I don't like cold.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, you're cold here. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so. Oh, okay, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Does my fur give me extra, extra non-cold, extra, extra cold-proof insulation? That's the word I was looking for.

[Speaker 5]
I'll use precipitation to warm my clothes for a bit.

[Speaker 8]
Just give me a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
You feel the warmth on them. Uh, you are still cold.

[Speaker 8]
I don't like that.

[Speaker 3]
Magical cold, baby. Is that like bone chill or something? Are our bones cold?

[Speaker 1]
Are you cold down to the bone? Yeah, that seems pretty reasonable.

[Speaker 2]
I don't like that. How long does it take to attune to things?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
It's like, is it just an hour? Uh, yeah, that's still too much time. I was considering unattuning and then reattuning to some things and see if the boots of the cold lands did anything, but I don't feel like spending an hour, two hours on that.

[Speaker 4]
Do they get colder if we get to the cage or if we go in to this area more? Or is it all just the same?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the center building here looks to be much, is taller and larger, obviously. The one on the left looks to be some kind of, some kind of barracks.

[Speaker 3]
The one on the left. Does it have a blanket? Do the barracks have beds with blankets?

[Speaker 1]
They do have beds.

[Speaker 7]
But no blankets?

[Speaker 5]
Well, isn't this an ominous find?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna lay in a bed and then you're gonna eat me? Is this the time you wish to sink? Oh, there's a creature in here.

Oh, wonderful. I bet they're cold.

[Speaker 1]
All right, everybody go ahead and add yourselves to... The initiative counter.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, there is no combat encounter in your current scene.

[Speaker 2]
Nope, I've added myself twice. Uh-oh.

[Speaker 3]
I get advantaged! Ah! Good knock.

How did I get a three? That is impressively bad. I rolled a one and an 18.

So, lucky me.

[Speaker 2]
Can you delete one of me? I can't delete myself on the initiative.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 4]
Whoopsies. I did it normal instead of with advantage. Oh, well.

[Speaker 1]
All right, they are all stacked up together. Perfect. Mimosa, you were up first.

[Speaker 4]
Right. Um, okay. Well, closest.

[Speaker 2]
Does a 22 hit?

[Speaker 1]
22 does hit.

[Speaker 2]
I hope so.

[Speaker 4]
Did a 17 hit?

[Speaker 1]
17 does hit. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
All right. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
All right, brings us to Kiwi. Rawr.

[Speaker 3]
And, uh, inventory... Do I get advantage on that? No.

[Speaker 1]
Only if you're reckless. 11 unfortunately misses.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, well then I will try that again.

[Speaker 3]
That hits. Plus, uh, I think. Is that what that?

[Speaker 8]
Oh, right.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If that's your turn, that brings us to Para.

[Speaker 3]
It is indeed my turn. Actually, hold on. Um, where is...

I'm gonna move this way. Is that gonna do an opportunity attack?

[Speaker 1]
None of them have reach, so no.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm gonna cast spirit guardians. I'm gonna move over here.

[Speaker 4]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
They all fail.

[Speaker 2]
Oh shit, they do. All right. And I am going to squeak.

Squeak, squeak. So this one and this one both are squeaked. Why do you call it squeaking?

Um, I don't know if you have ever seen it, but I made an animation of what I imagine every time I do my draconic cry. Um, and it's basically the Fluttershy scream.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what that sounds like. It probably sounds like squeak, I'm assuming.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll go see if I can find it in the art channel.

[Speaker 3]
Please do.

[Speaker 1]
Um. It is very delightful.

[Speaker 3]
Um, one of my, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you are. Okay, so Para, I need an extra d8 for all these critters.

[Speaker 4]
I completely forgot about that. Good reminder. Good catch.

[Speaker 1]
That was very good. Nice.

[Speaker 8]
No worries.

[Speaker 1]
All right, now it is the ghost's turn and all the other creatures' turns. This creature is going to move over here. I believe they have to make another save at the start of their turn.

[Speaker 2]
Um, their creature's speed is halved in the area and starts its turn. So when it enters the area the first time, or starts its turn there. So it's already done.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, it is going to attempt to... That's probably the only hit I will get tonight, but that'll be just fine. All right, 20 necrotic damage to Para.

[Speaker 2]
All right, are we in dim light?

[Speaker 1]
You are in bright light.

[Speaker 2]
Bright light, all right. And then I make my con save.

[Speaker 1]
This Ghostblade Eidolon is going to attack Eevee.

[Speaker 8]
How dare.

[Speaker 1]
Gonna do it twice.

[Speaker 4]
How dare.

[Speaker 1]
Does 17 hit?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
A 10 does not.

[Speaker 1]
It's 17 damage.

[Speaker 3]
All righty. Uh, do I half that because I'm raging?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see here. You have the slashing damage, which is 9. And then the 8 is force damage.

So I don't know if you have force damage. I don't know. It depends on whether or not you're like air totem.

What's its flying speed? Flying speed is 40. So yeah, so you would take a total of...

You would have the 9 to 4. And then you would take another 8. So a grand total of 12.

And this critter just moved in for the first time. So I'm gonna have it make its save. Parowind will damage.

Just remember to add an extra d8. Ghost fails.

[Speaker 3]
Did they make... Is that a... Hold on.

Is that a... Did they hit?

[Speaker 1]
It rolled an 8. So I assume it's not gonna hit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I have sentinel. So if you're within 5 feet of me, I can...

I can... Or I think maybe it's... I have a thing where I can half the damage.

Either half it or at least decrease it.

[Speaker 1]
Path of the Ancestral Guardian Spirit Shield. Yeah. Those that you defend.

You could use a reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

[Speaker 3]
So that's why I'm trying to stick close to people.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. There's one last ghost. She's gonna attack Mimosa.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I didn't even notice you misspelled quest.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I misspelled quest.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, make me a charisma saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
Easy peasy. Oh no!

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa's possessed.

[Speaker 8]
Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
We can knock it out of her.

[Speaker 5]
Can you banish a ghost possessing someone?

[Speaker 4]
I think if I take damage it helps me, right?

[Speaker 2]
Dispel evil and good is what it specifically says in there. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yep, all of the ghosts went together. They all attempted an attack except for the last one that tried to possess.

The ghost blade is wielding an actual sword and hit ki beat once.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, great thing about it being- Let me just actually just cast this. So, the great thing about higher levels is that I can now target two creatures. So, first the one that's currently possessing and the ghost blade.

Both of them have to do saving throws.

[Speaker 1]
All righty, Mimosa saves.

[Speaker 8]
Pity.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Wrong save, okay.

[Speaker 1]
This one does not. Did you not make the correct save earlier?

[Speaker 7]
Hmm?

[Speaker 1]
When you said wrong save?

[Speaker 4]
No, no, no, no, no, no. The 22 was against being depossessed, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, and I said woo because I thought that meant I was not possessed anymore. So, I cheered the wrong one.

[Speaker 8]
That's all right.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I don't have anything to do with bonus actions.

[Speaker 5]
So, that's my turn. Thanks for trying. You're welcome.

Well, at least the ghost blade is somewhere else now.

[Speaker 1]
It has been poofed out of existence. There is a glowing ethereal sword left in its place. Wait.

We come now to Mimosa.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I am possessed. Do you control me or do I just do whatever?

[Speaker 1]
You can do whatever. Who would you like to attack?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that was my... I'm gonna do a 1d3. Okie dokie then.

Hello. I'm going to be attacking your... Stop, that's my cheese.

Your necromancer.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, hello. Hi.

[Speaker 1]
There's no sneak attack.

[Speaker 4]
Sneak attack? I have one that's... Okay, well, okay.

Alright, and once more.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa just runs away from the ghost and immediately starts...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I assume a 23 hits.

[Speaker 2]
Would the ghost still take damage in Mimosa? And would Mimosa now take damage because she is...

[Speaker 1]
I think it's gonna be both. I think... God, that's such a good question.

I think both are gonna take damage. I think that's the easiest fair way to do it. And probably the easiest way for me to remember.

[Speaker 4]
Christ on a stick, that hurts. Sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Christ on a stick, I like that.

[Speaker 4]
That'll be Mimosa's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so Mimosa's gonna take 20 damage. The ghost will be dispelled.

[Speaker 5]
So... How much damage do I take from that? I'm getting stabbed.

Twice. You took... Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I took a total of 21.

[Speaker 5]
21. Uh-huh. Okay, well, I'm glad I'm not...

I'm glad we start at level 4. Sorry, at level 8. That's for one.

I would have died as a level 1.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, you are no longer possessed. You are briefly...

[Speaker 5]
I am so sorry. You can just... You see the most scandalized look on his face for a couple seconds before he's just like...

Well, I'm glad to see you're unpossessed.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Kibi, we come to you.

[Speaker 3]
Cubes. Um... Okay.

I'm gonna hit this bitch. Um... Kibi, Kibi, Kibi.

Inventory. Kibi. It's Mac'Em.

Mac'Em.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, both of those...

[Speaker 3]
Hello, Mother.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that was a damage roll. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, hold on. Um... And then I have...

[Speaker 1]
It has one hit point left.

[Speaker 3]
One hit point? Okay. Well, then that's my go.

And, uh... I will move... Here.

Um, if, uh... Did you by any chance not get a second attack? I think I did do a second attack, didn't I?

Did you? Oh, that was damage. Uh...

Okay. And then I have to dart out really quickly. That definitely hits.

Um, you said it has one hit point? Yep. Not even a little damage.

Um, I'm gonna stand here. Can you... I have to go run and do something really quickly.

I'm just gonna go ahead and put this here just in case they're hit.

[Speaker 1]
I think Pear is probably gonna nuke it this round.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Alright. I'll be right back.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Pear, it's your turn. Yeah, I guess I can nuke it. Um...

[Speaker 2]
Um... I guess I'll Guiding Bolt... I'm casting it at second level, but I'm gonna use the...

Or I'm gonna... I'm using a second level slot, but I'm gonna put the cast as a third level because they're up.

[Speaker 1]
That definitely hits.

[Speaker 2]
And if it's not dead, then everyone gets, um, advantage. And then I have to use up that. There we go.

It's fine, because on the start of its turn, it has to do another Spirit Guardian.

[Speaker 1]
Um... I'm gonna make... I'm gonna roll for the save.

You go ahead and roll for damage. Alright, it's toast.

[Speaker 5]
Yippee!

[Speaker 1]
Alright. So, in this room, there was...

[Speaker 2]
What is five times my Cleric level? The math gets harder as I level up every time. It's currently 80.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
You could always do times ten, then divide by two. That's easier.

[Speaker 2]
That... That's more steps. That's harder.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, fair enough.

[Speaker 2]
I am not le smart. If there's too many steps, I just won't do it. I was just gonna see if I could split healing.

Um, but I think I'll save that for a time when we actually need some healing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, there are three thousand copper pieces here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
And then there are a bunch of valuable gems right next to it.

[Speaker 7]
Yay.

[Speaker 5]
I take the time to go down and being like, Don't worry, I don't hold it against you. Possession takes a lot out of a person, doesn't it? How are you feeling?

[Speaker 4]
Are you being sincere? Sincere? Well, like, don't lie.

I mean, you would be in hell if I did. I meant, like, sincere versus condescending.

[Speaker 5]
Sincere but condescending. But... He doesn't really know how to school his tone properly, so he is being sincere.

It's just, it comes out bad.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Um, we'll just give a play smile. I'm doing fine.

[Speaker 5]
Fantastic. Is there any way I can make it up to you?

[Speaker 2]
Actually, what's your health at?

[Speaker 5]
He's sort of just like, my health? Oh, it's at 54 out of 74. What?

No, that's not how math works. It's at... It's at 53 out of 74.

So I'll be fine for a couple more stabs. But yeah, he'll be fine. Okay.

But when you say, how can I make it up to you, he sort of just perks up and is really like, well, I can't think of anything at the moment, but can I cash in a favor at a later time?

[Speaker 4]
Within reason, yes. If I had kept Possess, I was going to garrote you, which is just like, incapacitate you and not kill you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm back. Sorry, I had a friend come over.

[Speaker 4]
It's all good. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Well, that's nice to know that I would not have died.

[Speaker 3]
Has anyone ever accidentally killed another player? Have you ever been playing and that happens? No, not yet.

Almost, yes, but not, no, no. I pushed someone into like, I pushed someone into the Underdark one time. I turned into a bear and pushed them into a pit that led to the Underdark.

Oh dear.

[Speaker 2]
Nettie's butt.

[Speaker 3]
I imagine we pick up the treasure.

[Speaker 5]
What's up with the sword? The cool sword that the thing I banished dropped.

[Speaker 1]
It's just floating there.

[Speaker 5]
Who wants to poke it?

[Speaker 4]
I'll touch it. Why not? You okay?

Poke the sword. Oh, I forgot about that. Wait, how big is the sword?

[Speaker 1]
How big is the sword? The sword is just kind of, it's probably about two feet in length.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah. If it doesn't immediately zap me when I poke it, I'm going to grab it.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I should have listened and rolled through all those. All I needed to do was, there's a lot of these, there's so many gems here. That's for you to find out.

And for the players to find out. Hmm. Okay, so there are seven gems worth a thousand gold pieces each here.

And then there are three gems worth a hundred gold pieces each. In addition to the three thousand copper pieces.

[Speaker 2]
Amazing.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. I imagine you're going to put it in the loop table later?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm going to session reports now. Okie dokie.

[Speaker 5]
I've got a question about the loot. When they say giant illusory deck, do they mean like giant sized or big? Giant sized.

As in a lot. Ah.

[Speaker 2]
If you scroll up, I posted a picture of some giant Pokemon cards. That's kind of what I'm picturing.

[Speaker 1]
Ah. You could attune to items made by giants. They just happen to look very, very big.

[Speaker 2]
They shrink to a still comical, but deal with-able size. Which is delightful. I think everything should have that.

[Speaker 5]
Okie dokie. Well that was a fight and a half. Then there doesn't seem to be anything else in the room that might stand us?

[Speaker 1]
The ethereal sword does move to respond to touch. It's pretty hard to grasp, but you can kind of like, kind of shove it, basically. You can kind of like, push it, just like by waving your hands, it'll move.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Can I mage hand it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a really easy way of using it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sweet. So I will hold it with mage hand, since it's far away from me. And also it means other people can use it if they want.

Just holding it at a distance. So, any of the other buildings you'd like to investigate?

[Speaker 7]
Um, do we want to investigate them all?

[Speaker 1]
What's the back end of this thing? Is the hole? Should you wish to exit?

We're probably not going to do the tower today, specifically. You guys will do that for the next session. Just so I can be like, actually extra prepared.

And not in the middle of moving.

[Speaker 4]
So then I suppose- Was there anything in the big one? Yeah. You guys haven't opened it yet.

Ah, Kiwi was all up in there, man.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi was all up in there?

[Speaker 8]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 3]
She touched every corner. I touched everything. I sniffed every bar.

I sniffed every corner. Every inch of the ground.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, there is a...

[Speaker 4]
Kiwi may look like a cat, but sometimes she's a dog. Absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
There is a creature- Look, it's the ancestors, man.

[Speaker 1]
There's a rathahumanoid creature inside the center of this room. They are chained by a number of spectral- Well, spectral chains. They have spectral manacles all over them, and they're a number of four-fingered hands, basically kind of like holding them in place.

The creature has six tentacles, and white, pale, cracked skin. It gets dry.

[Speaker 3]
Where are these tentacles located?

[Speaker 1]
On its face.

[Speaker 3]
I don't like this.

[Speaker 8]
Of course.

[Speaker 1]
I don't like this.

[Speaker 5]
If it was where its legs would be, then I would be like, oh, okay. But no. No, it's on its face.

[Speaker 3]
Does it have a vanilla, garlicky smell?

[Speaker 8]
What? What?

[Speaker 3]
What? Has no one banged the mine- Not answering that question. Question?

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, what do you mean by- You know what? I think it's fine. Alright.

I put down the sword that we were currently touching with Mage Hand, and asked if I should poke it with Mage Hand at a distance. Is it lifeless?

[Speaker 1]
Just briefly. No, it's like looking at you guys. You can't hear- No, never mind.

[Speaker 5]
I don't touch it then. Don't even think about touching it. That thought does not cross my head.

[Speaker 1]
It is covered by a globe.

[Speaker 3]
Globe. Oh. Covered by a what?

[Speaker 1]
Globe. Globe. Globe with shimmering energy.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna point at it and ask, what is that? No response.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, but- Mimosa's gonna take out a pen and paper, and she'll write, are you okay on it, and then show it to the- It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 5]
Ask it what it is. Do you know why you've been put in?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, first- It's a mind flayer, right? Like we all- Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's a mind flayer, Gibi. Answer why it's been put in, or does it know why it's been put in? If you write that down, it does shake its head up and down for a guess.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, so it knows why it's been put in there. That's interesting.

[Speaker 3]
Well, probably brain-eating-related crimes, but- Gibi was put in bugs when she was young. It was for a crime. She probably committed crime.

[Speaker 2]
She had- Are mind flayers from another plane of existence? I can banish those. Yeah.

It would be a way to set it free.

[Speaker 5]
True, and if it's willing, it won't have to do any save of sorts. But also, it's a mind flayer. Sorry, I'm not saying this in character, but it is a mind flayer.

In character, it would be like, that is true, but we're not exactly sure how it got here and why. It might also, while being appreciative, it might also show its appreciation through eating us.

[Speaker 4]
They tend to do that. Okay. I guess she'll ask, Were you- No.

Are you in here because you were dangerous to your captors?

[Speaker 1]
It knows it's in.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, most people are dangerous to their captors.

[Speaker 4]
I suppose. If we help you, will you hurt us?

[Speaker 3]
It knows that we will not help it if it says yes. So...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, then it could also be lying, but hopefully... It'll just shrug and be like, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I can always incite it as well.

[Speaker 4]
That's true.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you. Much appreciated. I'm going to incite it.

[Speaker 4]
Its silence is telling.

[Speaker 1]
So what are you trying to get at here? If we help it, it'll come.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was hoping that I would incite after Mimosa asked her question to see if its answer was... Truthful, I guess? Like, is this a danger to us, or...

[Speaker 1]
It nods its head in a very studied, unenthusiastic way.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, since it's being truthful. Is this like a zone of truth of sorts?

[Speaker 8]
Rather than like a globe of invulnerability.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, well. Much appreciated. Kibi's curiosity leads her to want this thing out.

That's fine, go for it.

[Speaker 8]
Personally, I think it's a terrible idea.

[Speaker 2]
It's evil, but it's a sentient being, and I feel bad for it.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I mean, if we banished it, then we'd be helping it without having to worry about it hurting.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, it wouldn't be an immediate threat.

[Speaker 3]
It did...

[Speaker 5]
Look, he's a very honest fellow, and I do appreciate that, thank you. But he did just admit he would be dangerous to us. Again, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
We should figure out why it's here first. Are there any signs or plates with engravings on it anywhere as to why this guy is here? The mind flayer.

Captured because...

[Speaker 5]
Let's spin the wheel. Do you think it's A. Eating people.

B. Nothing much. C.

General, you know...

[Speaker 2]
He's actually in here for selling drugs.

[Speaker 4]
Turning people. He's in here for tax evasion. That would be a twist.

He's actually just a bad influence on you. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Tax evasion is a crime, Virgil. It's an obligation!

[Speaker 5]
By the way, I just hope you guys know that mind flayers do in fact keep sentient creatures as pets, or like, companions, but they also think it's the greatest honor to be eaten by them if they like you as well, so... Either way. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I read up on them one day. So, yeah, even if you're nice to them, they're like, wow, wonderful people. They have their leagues above us in intelligence and motives.

[Speaker 4]
That's what they think. Well, yeah, we're all like, minus one.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I mean, it's probably no problem.

[Speaker 4]
It really wouldn't be much.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, who's... What is everyone's intelligence? Because we might be fine.

[Speaker 2]
We might be okay. I think the doctor is not, but that's...

[Speaker 3]
That's the guess, you know? Whoever has an eight in intelligence, you might be fine. We're close, but not quite.

[Speaker 5]
Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you see this current situation, I have maxed out my intelligence. Oh, boy.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, you're gonna be a tasty treat.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you're a meal. You are. Para did develop mild telepathy, so there's that, I suppose.

I think that might be what the thing around him is.

[Speaker 3]
To keep them from influencing outside sources, or outside things. Ooh, maybe we should ask it that.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi's gonna talk really slowly to it. I'll pen out what she's saying. Is the bubble to keep you from being telepathic?

[Speaker 1]
It nods its head.

[Speaker 3]
If we move into the circle... Alright, someone dumb should go in. Hi!

Well, I mean, I've already been possessed today. Don't do it again! It's chained down, right?

Three chains. If it's chained down, it won't be able to hurt us. We'll just be able to talk to it.

[Speaker 5]
It has psychic energy.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Who's got the most... I mean, okay, hang on. The bubble, is it around the whole thing, or was it just around its head like a helmet?

Because that's what I was picturing.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's like a globe of invulnerability that's completely around this thing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'm gonna... I'm gonna step to the edge of it and just kinda put my hand in there.

I'm gonna hold your other hand to pull you back.

[Speaker 4]
With my knight's strength, this is gonna work. I'm just gonna poke.

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't go through the barrier.

[Speaker 4]
It doesn't go through the barrier?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, we tried.

[Speaker 1]
It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 8]
In response to we tried.

[Speaker 5]
Go bust a tire.

[Speaker 4]
Go bust a tire.

[Speaker 5]
Awesome!

[Speaker 8]
I get someone after all this time.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, they're all dumb.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, he's so entertaining. That warms my heart, actually. Alright, so...

Asking again, if we free you, will you eat us? Or hurt us in any way?

[Speaker 1]
It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Do you mind if we come back at a later point in time? It nods its head no.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. It nods its head no. Seriously, we cannot forget the Mind Flayer.

It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so...

[Speaker 5]
Sort of just gives the okay sign and just like backs off a bit.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have a plan? Dex, what are you trying to get at? Get out of here.

[Speaker 3]
Could we use this Mind Flayer in any way? Is there a reason other than just the kindness of our hearts that we could let this thing out? I say thing because it doesn't have a soul.

It's a thing.

[Speaker 4]
I'm sure we could gain its allegiance somehow, but that's going to be a tenuous...

[Speaker 5]
I mean, yes, but there's also this thing of letting it go and then it eats other people. Which might not garner other people's favor.

[Speaker 2]
Well, that's what I was saying. You would like banish it out of the chain so that it went home. Okay, fine.

It would take a while to get back, I would hope. I don't know. Where are they even from?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I can't remember. Um...

[Speaker 2]
No, not the astral plane.

[Speaker 3]
They're aberrants, so they should be from...

[Speaker 2]
Where is it?

[Speaker 3]
Is all the Mind Flayer lore that's in you know, regular good old fashioned D&D the same here?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they are mostly the same.

[Speaker 3]
So like, the grand design and bullshit like that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, you know what? If you have...

[Speaker 3]
The Forgotten Realms is good.

[Speaker 1]
You have... Let's see here. You specifically have fuckin' astral tides on your frogmoth head.

Does anybody want to do any arcana checks on this thing?

[Speaker 8]
I have what?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I might as well try. Oh my god!

[Speaker 5]
I got the best result I possibly could!

[Speaker 2]
I'm amazed!

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna pull up astral tides.

[Speaker 2]
I've dated one of these once. Oh, I'm sorry, I just punched you, baby. I love that.

[Speaker 1]
What a string of sentences.

[Speaker 2]
I threw my hands out in a gesture and I actually smacked my cat. He doesn't care.

[Speaker 7]
In fact, he immediately started licking my hand.

[Speaker 1]
Which one am I gonna do? Let's go to page 63.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Someone got kicked. Oh, it was heart.

Oh, they're back. It's my battery died.

[Speaker 5]
My computer died, so I had to plug it back in. So one moment as I refresh everything.

[Speaker 8]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 5]
So Foundry's gonna take a second to load as again, sudden exits do not look any good.

[Speaker 1]
These creatures are known as Telmerans to people who are a little bit more... to people whose gods have clued them in or people who have fought Telmerans specifically or have been conscripted to fight Telmerans. Or Arcanists, planeswalkers, people who've been to other planes of existence typically know who they are.

[Speaker 3]
Is that Arcana or Arcana?

[Speaker 1]
Mind Flayer?

[Speaker 3]
Did you say something about Mind Flayer?

[Speaker 1]
Do you guys hear me?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah. I lagged. It took a second.

Personally, my brain.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my children are being loud.

[Speaker 1]
So people are aware of these creatures if they've either been conscripted to fight them, if they are planeswalkers, such as Para, technically speaking, and a lot of particularly advanced wizards. Or aware of them in some capacity.

[Speaker 4]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Particularly Necromancers. Interesting.

[Speaker 5]
Can you repeat what you said there, Cole?

[Speaker 1]
Telmerans.

[Speaker 5]
Telmerans. Alright, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. They used to have a star-spanning empire, a multi-star spanning empire. They do still have some influence over the stars and a few worlds that are under their exclusive control.

They want to warp, a rather horrible warp, with another species that they subjugated, or another planet they subjugated. A dead world known as Nezodamon housing mostly insectoid creatures, or insectoid species. And after that let's see here.

It was the only successful rebellion that's ever been recorded against the Telmerans themselves. And the resulting war led them to let the species of Nezodamon to start conquering stars of their own. And there was some kind of stalemate between them that resulted in most of each forces resulted, mostly all of their forces getting reduced to nothing.

That's what Pera would know via the Plainswalker lore. Let's see here. The base here is aware that they use squid ships.

Biological vessels that are capable of transporting themselves across the plains. And there are a small host of them on the other side of the planet.

[Speaker 8]
We're also aware- What's up?

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm thinking of the star people. The...

[Speaker 1]
The starspawn.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the starspawn. Because I know I've encountered plenty of those. I was thinking with the vampires there might have been a couple but I think those are starspawns too.

[Speaker 1]
The last thing that you're aware of is Telmerans are not supposed to show their tentacles. They're normally supposed to be embedded in kind of like a their maw is supposed to be embedded basically in a vertical slit in the front of their face. But this one appears to be much more- and they're supposed to be a different color than purple or just kind of like dark brown or ebony.

[Speaker 3]
He's been starving for a while so if we let him out he's gonna eat eat us.

[Speaker 1]
Not only is this one white but like the skin itself is cracked and this I don't know it doesn't read as anything that you've seen before from there or read about even of their morphology.

[Speaker 4]
Is your condition because you've been trapped here or because you've been- no because you haven't been able to eat? I wonder.

[Speaker 1]
It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 3]
Is it lying? Does it look desperate?

[Speaker 4]
Are I'm gonna incite that. Are you being used for some sort of experiment?

[Speaker 3]
Is it because he's hungry? I already asked and he said no. I know but I'm inciting him.

What if he's lying? He could be desperate.

[Speaker 8]
Eleven?

[Speaker 1]
Same. Studied. Not like not really energetic or or anything just kind of like a studied slow shake nose.

[Speaker 5]
Do you eat people?

[Speaker 1]
Let's just ask that straight out.

[Speaker 4]
I asked if he was being used as like a power source for an experiment or something.

[Speaker 1]
Used as a power source? It shakes its head.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Interesting.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't catch the answer for that. What did he say?

[Speaker 4]
He's being used as a power source.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Involuntarily? Clearly. Otherwise he wouldn't be captured.

I was gonna say he sees like Mimosa go like I feel like that's obvious but she'll write it out like involuntarily?

[Speaker 8]
Question mark?

[Speaker 1]
It nods for yes. Sorry it shakes its involuntarily it shakes its head no.

[Speaker 5]
So he chose to be here. Whoa. Not our problem then.

Um. Do you want out?

[Speaker 1]
It shakes its head yes. It nods its head yes. God dammit.

[Speaker 4]
It's all good. Yes or no I can go by those. It does want out.

[Speaker 5]
Because hearing that he sort of just like it's not his problem he chose to be here. So it just sort of like swiveled around and started going back. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Well. Mimosa will write I promise I'll come back and to the best of my ability try to get you out.

[Speaker 5]
He pauses after thinking of something and then goes back around and was like choosing to be here. Was there a specific deal? Or is it just you wanted to be in a cage for whatever reason?

[Speaker 4]
Mimosa will ask Mimosa will ask like did you volunteer as part of the deal?

[Speaker 1]
It nods its head yes.

[Speaker 5]
Well definitely not my problem then. Did they abandon you?

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't answer.

[Speaker 4]
Well I mean she'll refer back to like I'll get you out but we have places we gotta go. Yeah. On we go then.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Are there anything I can take from here? Like a bit of scrap so that I can get back here with a teleport?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah that's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
There is a tablet marked with arcane squigglings in front of this place.

[Speaker 4]
I'm sorry Hey you mean person can you read any of these? Mimosa will ask can you read any of these?

[Speaker 2]
Oh that wasn't the person I was talking about. He's in a cage.

[Speaker 4]
Oh you mean the necromancer. Yeah the one who's just gonna leave our new friends.

[Speaker 2]
That's cute and mean.

[Speaker 7]
He's like what?

[Speaker 5]
He's like well it was part of a deal unless it was broken on the other person's side there's nothing we can do about it.

[Speaker 4]
But we don't know if they abandoned it for dead or not.

[Speaker 5]
I do suppose it would be the worst thing if the contractor broke their side of the deal.

[Speaker 4]
Alright then I'll try to read them. Mimosa will remember that logic. He doesn't like breaking deals that's the worst thing anyone can do.

Yeah and she's remembering it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god Dex will you please stop smashing your face into everything? How dare you ask that of him.

[Speaker 5]
So what do I roll to try and read these? Or rather what are they written in and can I read them?

[Speaker 2]
He said arcane squiggling so.

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait I have comprehend languages on.

[Speaker 4]
I thought you were gonna say wait I have arcane squiggling.

[Speaker 1]
If you cast comprehend languages I don't know if they'll tell you what kind of language this is but um you are fed information like just kind of like beamed into your head. Um thoughts of my assistant. My assistant.

Why are you doing this to me? Oh my god I got it. Alright.

Anyways. You're fed information about a contract between this creature and the drought outpost that it would be used to protect the drought here from psionic intrusion.

[Speaker 8]
Mhm.

[Speaker 1]
And in turn the drought would protect it from discovery via this globe of vulnerability. So it devised this ritual that it wouldn't be able to hurt the drought. It was a joint operation to devise a ritual to make sure that this thing couldn't escape and simultaneously couldn't be accessed.

[Speaker 5]
So they did break the contract.

[Speaker 3]
Rude. Right?

[Speaker 1]
As far as the timeline goes it was about 750 years ago. Jeez.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So he sort of looks at it and is just like oh that- how awful. They did break the contract.

And repeats the information to everyone so they know how what an atrocity this is.

[Speaker 4]
It shakes its head no.

[Speaker 5]
Didn't break the contract? He just asked them to repeat himself.

[Speaker 1]
Did they all die?

[Speaker 5]
So they didn't break the contract?

[Speaker 1]
It shakes its head yes.

[Speaker 5]
Huh. And he sort of just like walks back a bit being like then are they dead?

[Speaker 4]
That's what I was about to ask. Did they all die? Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
There you go.

[Speaker 5]
You can ask that one. Oh that one?

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Then the contract's null and void. There is nothing for you to protect. Therefore nothing is broken either way.

Though it would have made you hmm no you only said psychic attack. So unless they died of psychic damage it isn't your fault. Right then?

[Speaker 7]
Did they die of psychic damage?

[Speaker 4]
Man your logic is insane.

[Speaker 1]
That's more factual not like Well here's the thing it got a couple good answers there.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It worked. Did they all die? Sorry did they die from psychic damage?

[Speaker 5]
We got the answer from did they die which was yes and I was wondering how they died but the specific one is psychic damage because if they died because of his failure on the contract end then you know while the contract is now null and void my character will be less even less wanting to free him but it'll be like well the contract really doesn't matter right now because they're not there to fulfill it.

[Speaker 1]
Itchfix has said no.

[Speaker 5]
Oh not psychic damage. Perfect. Would the spell magic work on these?

[Speaker 1]
You could attempt to dispel magic. Okay. Right now you're looking at a ritual so the things that you do and like magics either magics, alchemical reagents rituals of your own just stuff that you try to do to this is going to either complete the ritual, corrupt the ritual, or banish it.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
You might just try straight up banishing them.

[Speaker 4]
Well okay hang on what if um do you want to just ask if like dispel magic will work if they want us to try it?

[Speaker 5]
I would.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 5]
So asking our local mind flayer if dispel magic works.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah okay we'll be back for you and then we're still here talking to you.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to figure out information about this particular ritual um is everybody here familiar with the research downtime action?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
That's kind of how you would do this thing. Not like in downtime though you could do it in downtime but in order to like get some initial information out of this thing that's how you would do it. Put this thing on charge.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
So do we want to try to get it out now or do we genuinely want to look around more than come back?

[Speaker 5]
I mean we could also ask the guy questions since he was part of the ritual so.

[Speaker 1]
My personal recommendation is not to end the session in the Underdark.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Okay. We'll go back up to the surface and then.

[Speaker 2]
I've got the thing. We can come back whenever we need to.

[Speaker 1]
Right now you guys are on the first of Okay. First of W'lyr. And you started on the 23rd.

Yeah, so you started on the 23rd and you're currently on this state. So you can put your characters here and just let me know what they're doing in between sessions I guess. It's pretty much going to pick up I mean it depends on how long you guys take to run this again.

They're going to be in time jail for the most part for the next week.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, time jail. Our old friend.

[Speaker 1]
But if like you guys get another opportunity to do it then we could just go further we could go further ahead. Okay. If you guys get another opportunity to do this session then what we can do is we'll just start back up where you guys left off it's going to put your characters a little bit further into time jail.

And after that there won't be any sessions for this group until they catch up. But that is an option.

[Speaker 5]
But can't we just ask the mind flayer about if dispel magic and or banishing would help?

[Speaker 1]
It kind of shrugs.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Alright. So we'll tape a BRB to the globe and we'll move on.

[Speaker 2]
He's waited 700 years he could probably wait a few more. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think time is just kind of not an issue anymore. I think he's just done.

[Speaker 1]
At the back of this cavern is an elevator that will take you to the surface. As Ed hopefully indicates. This is the one piece that he actually does know how to manipulate.

He starts moving his hooves around the something that indicates that it takes him to the surface.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you kindly.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. And then that's where we'll end it with you guys making it back up.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 8]
Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
Hi. I'm gonna go chill out. I just got a lockpicking kit.

I'm gonna go learn how to pick locks and become the best rogue around.

[Speaker 2]
Why? I do have a question for you before you leave. If you were gonna do like a pathfinder one shot are you chill with like a premade character or would you rather try making your own first?

[Speaker 3]
Premade sounds alright. Cause I wouldn't know how to do any of it so premade would help me do that.

[Speaker 2]
I was definitely looking at pathfinder one shots and there's one I wanna do and it requires premades. And I, my normal group doesn't like premades too much. Though I did get them to do it.

I just never tried it so far. Making your own character isn't very special.

[Speaker 8]
However it's always fun to just hand it to the person to play it.

[Speaker 3]
It is fun.

[Speaker 1]
Premades are fun when you're pre-mined about it. So you don't have to waste making a character and letting me work on it. Horse is gonna do next.

Least of all the horse. He's never been in a hospital before. He's as confused as you are.

Horse used the elevator. I'm gonna head out.

[Speaker 2]
Okey dokey. Go have fun with your picking kit. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks for arriving. Sorry it was a slow session. I'm going to go yell at a bunch of different potential departments now.

[Speaker 7]
Good luck.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
Peace.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I'll say.

[Speaker 8]
Of course.

[Speaker 3]
I mean there's also the advantage that if they find their niche they are not fouling up our niche.

[Speaker 4]
That's a benefit too. Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Well that's the reason why you can't be a live and let live kind of guy.

[Speaker 4]
You should be a live and let live kind of guy but only if people are in a different niche.

[Speaker 6]
If everybody is in the same niche you do have to set some ground and follow the rules.

[Speaker 3]
Draw some lines in the sand.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah of course.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah it's like

[Speaker 6]
But that is certainly annoying evening shift.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, it's fine. I got plenty of comparisons to the bosses making comparisons to the sabotage people. And we had a relatively productive conversation about it.

[Speaker 6]
It also just took an extra half hour that I got a bunch of people who were like, I think fake callers. I'm not sure. I was nervous about concern at all conspiratorial.

[Speaker 1]
But no, besides that, I mean, got a few sales, got some work done.

[Speaker 6]
So I'm fine.

[Speaker 7]
Very nice.

[Speaker 6]
What the fuck is going on in that kitchen?

[Speaker 5]
My son wrote that.

[Speaker 6]
Interesting.

[Speaker 5]
That is my kitchen. You can tell by the scribbles.

[Speaker 6]
I was about to say, getting some graffiti storm.

[Speaker 5]
They color on everything and anything. And I it's it's a battle that I will just clean up when we leave. Because there's no stopping it.

And I will go crazy if I have to follow them and tell them to stop. But yeah, we're pretty sure he was hanging off of the because it's one of those that has a cutting board. You pull out or pressure he was hanging off of that by his fingers because that's what he likes to do.

And it popped out because there was only like 12 nails in that.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I like to imagine he didn't get hurt, did he?

[Speaker 5]
No. No, I don't think he did. Or he barely got hurt.

I just know that when my husband found him, he had you see those almond joys up there. Grab one of the almond joys and was like, Hey, can you open this for me?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, my God.

[Speaker 5]
So I'm pretty sure he was fine.

[Speaker 4]
And I just turned the brightness up on my computer and I can see so much more. So I'm gonna kick ass and call it duty later.

[Speaker 6]
My God. Assuming we don't need extra characters.

[Speaker 5]
I'm just bringing them.

[Speaker 6]
You shouldn't. Okay, unless you die, but try not to. Yeah, it's just a vampire.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, what?

[Speaker 5]
No, it's a skeleton case.

[Speaker 4]
I hope it's got vampires. It does have vampires. I remember it does.

[Speaker 5]
A skeleton case?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think it has vampires in it. Or at least vampires in it because they're the ones that- yeah, because Susudio was gonna go undercover. And they were like, not friendly towards undercover Susudio.

Despite him being one of them, kind of. He's, you know, a frog. But he's also a damp here.

So I don't know. Half vampire, half frog. I love that.

[Speaker 1]
You're getting it confused with Skeleton Cave 2. Sorry, this is Skeleton Cave 1.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, of course. Skeleton Cave 1.

[Speaker 3]
Genshin has to put himself in the party.

[Speaker 5]
Unbelievable.

[Speaker 6]
Do you believe it?

[Speaker 5]
You know, just off the top of my head. No, go ahead.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, so was I.

[Speaker 2]
That's why that didn't go on first.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Rose was in the trash pile, and I was just gonna say, ha.

[Speaker 2]
All right, now, what I was going to say was, all of the party has dark vision except Mikanin, so.

[Speaker 3]
We're gonna bring a torch for you, Matt. That's okay, Para can be the torch.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yes, she glows, I love that. Also, funnily enough, my familiar technically has worse eyesight than I do, because it has low light, not dark vision. Okie dokie, I will activate the scene.

[Speaker 1]
There's not really a whole lot to it. Your buddies have felt the allure of the Skeleton Cave. Your skeletons have been drafted into the Skeleton War.

It's not too far from Von Lark.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Mimosa, don't forget to rest.

[Speaker 6]
You're still a bit scraped. On Mikanin. I'll do that when I can.

[Speaker 1]
I'll send Mimosa to fall.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Done. Easy.

[Speaker 6]
Dude, give me the ball, please. Oh, he's doing the no-ball-only throw. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, as you enter the cave against your better judgment, you hear the sounds of combat down the first tunnel.

[Speaker 4]
What kind of combat?

[Speaker 1]
Just, like, swords swiping, or just...? There's, like, swords clanging on stone, and growls.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, what kind of growls?

[Speaker 1]
You can do a Nature Recall Knowledge if you'd like to try and identify the growls.

[Speaker 4]
We will do, uh... I got a three.

[Speaker 2]
I'll do a Recall Knowledge. Um, what check did you say it was? Oh, Nature.

[Speaker 1]
Nature, or some kind of lore?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no.

[Speaker 3]
Eleven! Slightly better.

[Speaker 1]
Sisudio, you were right. There are vampires in this cave.

[Speaker 3]
I think I see vampires.

[Speaker 4]
Up ahead. I can smell them.

[Speaker 1]
Um, Dr. Basha and Para, you know they are some kind of, um, beast growls.

[Speaker 2]
I thought that was a down slightly. What were you saying it was, Sisudio? Vampires.

Definitely. Oh, dear. Possibly, uh, avoid this until we see the situation going on.

[Speaker 1]
So, how many left? Make sure each of you have a hero point, and I will consider giving one out in an hour. Thank you.

Ow.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um, so who wants to go first? You know what, I'm gonna...

[Speaker 1]
That should make McCannon go first. Yeah, McCannon, how secure are you?

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, you know what, let me, let me creep the door open just a little bit and stealthily look in. Oh wait, the door's open already. I wasn't aware of that.

[Speaker 1]
There's no door, you're just in the cave.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. You can creep forward. Alright, so, I'm gonna creep forward.

Should I roll a stealth first?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can roll a stealth for initiative when we get to that. Okay. You can definitely eat a pig forward though without doing, triggering anything.

You can see, uh, you can move a pig forward.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, McCannon, do you need help with, uh, moving?

[Speaker 6]
If you don't push the walls. Well, it depends on whether you want me to continue on my knees, or...

[Speaker 4]
Come back. All right, so, there's skeletons and vampire wolves up ahead.

[Speaker 7]
Don't care.

[Speaker 4]
Delightful.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Who is paying these skeletons?

[Speaker 3]
Do you think it is just better to have a light on?

[Speaker 2]
It may be, but we might not want to alert them to our presence just yet, but we are going to find them.

[Speaker 3]
She gestures at McCannon. Yeah, fair enough. All right, fair enough, uh, it's really, there'll be some surprises.

[Speaker 2]
I agree.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so we've got two choices. We either tie a rope around McCannon's waist and leave him in the dark, or we light up.

[Speaker 4]
Well, once the fighting starts, nobody's going to be kind of, uh, useless.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, I want, um, Cecilia to get a hero point. That made me laugh, committing to the bit.

[Speaker 7]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
All right, onwards, then? All righty.

[Speaker 1]
You hear the clashing of combat still going on. Occasionally, you'll hear, Die, foul beast! One of the skeletons says, Wolves hunt in packs!

[Speaker 7]
They've got Laura Bailey on the payroll.

[Speaker 3]
I bet the wolves really want those bones. McCannon, you're going to lose us. McCannon, you're light source!

[Speaker 7]
Oh, sorry, I was turning in the wrong direction.

[Speaker 1]
With Para's light, um, the skeletons call out to you, Recruits, help us slay these foul beasts! Please! We're going to start a mission, uh, we're going to start a combat.

He's dead.

[Speaker 4]
I guess there's no point in using stealth.

[Speaker 1]
Um... You can use stealth, still. Um, if you would like.

[Speaker 3]
No, what? No, I guess I'm using stealth. I did not mean to.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. Did you have enough of that? Eileen, I have this whole bunch.

You're good. You don't need any more.

[Speaker 1]
Now, these skeletons are currently aligned with the party, so they should trigger flanking if you wish to utilize that. Okay, we have... I'm just missing Dr. Basha, I think.

[Speaker 7]
Oh no, did heart get kicked?

[Speaker 1]
Oh no.

[Speaker 7]
I'm banned.

[Speaker 1]
Served out your prison sentence. Ready heart, we just need Dr. Basha's initiative roll.

[Speaker 2]
My computer, the moment you said roll initiative, the computer was like, you know what would be really funny right now?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, did, like, foundry get closed?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. So, um, you're gonna have to kick heart out. So that heart can rejoin.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no, it's working, it's working.

[Speaker 7]
So I wonder if they fixed that glitch.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I've had that happen to me before when I've lagged out.

[Speaker 3]
I know it used to be really bad where, like, my players wouldn't be able to rejoin for, like, an hour.

[Speaker 1]
I had to make a, um, an extra player that had control of every sheet so they could use it when they'd get lucked out of this.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if I'd trust my current players with that power.

[Speaker 5]
I wouldn't want that power. Stop eating my clothes. Stop that.

[Speaker 7]
Dang it.

[Speaker 5]
Is it the cat or is it the goat? It's the cat. She always eats my clothes.

[Speaker 4]
Dude, every shirt that I own has a hole in it now because of this fucking game.

[Speaker 5]
You later just called Penelope Rosie. Same behavior. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Let's begin. Uh, we have a couple turns of skeletons attacking wolves.

That is one hit. That is three hits. He kills that one.

Easy. Now the wolf's turn. It does the same thing.

He fails his knockdown. He's fine. He gets one more.

Misses. Okay. McCannon, it is your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Is, or will we say that the, we said these wolves are related to my investigation?

[Speaker 1]
I am going to make a blanket decision and say anything in this cave is related to your investigation.

[Speaker 3]
I think Jim should ask every time anyway.

[Speaker 1]
That's your god given, right? It's an investigator. Jim, is there anything off about this room?

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
What does it say C by 2?

[Speaker 2]
Are the skeletons on our side, just for clarification?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they want your help. They specifically asked the new recruits to help.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, just making sure. Alright, I'll throw a stick at the dog. Fun!

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that off guard got it to the crit. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Three cheers, three cheers, and critical damage. Alright, so that was action one. I do need to move closer for literally all my other spells, so that will be...

Oh wow, there are more dogs than I thought there would be. Okay, so let's move forward a bit. I keep interacting with walls.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
It's a bit better once you get out of view.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. And then... And then...

We only have one action left. I don't have much else to do, that's only one other action. So we shall just cast shield.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, and that is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
We move to Para.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. I don't see a single dog, so I'm going to spend action moving up. Oh, there's a big dog.

How obnoxious do I want to be? I won't be too obnoxious just yet. We're going to daze the dog.

[Speaker 1]
I see.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think it rounds down to nothing.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, honey. Whoops, I did not mean to move that far. I thought I had him measured.

Cool.

[Speaker 1]
I've moved you back to the corner of the wolf square.

[Speaker 5]
She was supposed to just stop here.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
Zap.

[Speaker 7]
In the bedroom.

[Speaker 5]
What's up?

[Speaker 1]
Wolf's getting fucked up, Jesus. Okay. He's going to try and kill one of these skeletons.

Fails to knock down.

[Speaker 2]
Ripped that one skeleton.

[Speaker 1]
Big rip. He spends his first action standing up, and he is going to keep attacking. Okay, Susudio.

[Speaker 4]
Susudio. Alright, two. He's near death.

I'm just going to flurry of blows.

[Speaker 1]
Good choice.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. It would be really funny to bite him. Flurry of blows is...

Make two unarmed strikes. If I make two, that's just one... Oh, hold on, that's fists.

Is that the same as unarmed attack? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I think unarmed attack can be fist or kicking or headbutt.

[Speaker 4]
And my second one would still be a map?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I failed. Alright, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
It's rough. Back to the top, we have skeleton champion. He is going to assault the wolf.

That sucks. Big one left. Mekanan, it is your turn.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, it is?

[Speaker 2]
Drag this down to the macro bar. It is long past time.

[Speaker 7]
Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
It is very hurt.

[Speaker 7]
I'll do it again. No, okay. Off guard to Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basha, it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Is it the near death one? That's off guard?

[Speaker 1]
That's the only one.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, the other ones are dead. Splendid, okay.

[Speaker 7]
Off guard... First... Second...

Attack.

[Speaker 1]
Off guard saved you again.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, three cheers.

[Speaker 1]
And you kill it. It drops to the ground with a heavy thud.

[Speaker 2]
Huzzah.

[Speaker 1]
Who's level two? Susudio, Mekanan, Mimosa? I am, I am indeed.

[Speaker 5]
Mimosa is level three.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So it's just Susudio and Mekanan. Excellent work, recruits.

Glad to have you in the Skeleton Wars. What is your purpose here? What is your calling?

This hard skeleton says.

[Speaker 2]
Well, personally I was intrigued to what exactly entailed in the Skeleton Cave. And perhaps how to make more?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I think that is happening here. We are quite fresh as well to the Skeleton Wars, so... We do not know the nature of them.

[Speaker 2]
Nature of them? Do you mean like how you were made?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, to get into specifics like that, sure. We do not know how we were made. We know our purpose is here in the Skeleton Wars.

Say, you're a bit fleshy for a skeleton.

[Speaker 7]
Are you not?

[Speaker 2]
He was approaching, but he goes back and steps back. He goes straight back. Yes, well, my calling is until a bit later, I imagine.

Not for a very, very, very, very, very long time. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Hopefully. I'm almost out of breath. This is awkward.

It really is. Oh, did I clink? Not here.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, the wizard has the charisma of like a small rat. He's doing his best. Maybe less.

Anyhow, do you mind if we just mosey on along? We're just passing by.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. If you aren't willing to part with your flesh, then I'm not sure what use we could have for you.

[Speaker 4]
Well, are you happy not having flesh?

[Speaker 1]
That is besides the point.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, but listen, I am planning on making more skeletons. The doctor doesn't elaborate on why. I am making more skeletons, and surely you would want more skeletons, right?

[Speaker 1]
I do like the sound of that.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly. And I can't do that without my flesh. So, in order to make more...

[Speaker 7]
Are you sure?

[Speaker 2]
More is more than one.

[Speaker 1]
Well, more troops would be good. Yes, you may enter.

[Speaker 2]
Splendid. I do appreciate your hospitality. And slowly.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, two people said something there.

[Speaker 4]
What's Dr. Basia doing?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, this was just me describing movement. You can ask your question.

[Speaker 4]
Does our skeleton friend have a name?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 4]
Valid.

[Speaker 1]
Skeleton one.

[Speaker 2]
And the game does pass.

[Speaker 1]
Be careful of the giant skeletons to the north. They are not really... They were willing to kill us.

Well, re-kill us, since we are dead. Uh, for entering their zone.

[Speaker 2]
Oh dear. Do you know why that is?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's a skeleton war. Skeletons be fighting.

[Speaker 2]
Of course, of course. Would you mind if we got rid of them for you?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you can try. They're quite scary, though.

[Speaker 2]
It's alright. We'll keep it in mind, though, to avoid them for now. Appreciate the help.

It's on. So, where do the rest of you wish to go?

[Speaker 5]
Does this look like a dead end?

[Speaker 1]
Around here is the dead end.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so we can go... North-East?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, shit. Hang on, sorry. This is a dead end here.

[Speaker 1]
As you're deciding what to do, the... That's all good, James. The skeletons say, Alright, boys, let's have a war!

And they start hitting each other until they all die.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yay.

[Speaker 2]
Well, uh, free bones. And the doctor goes up and sees if he can get their bones.

[Speaker 4]
Can he?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can collect skeleton bones and so on.

[Speaker 4]
Splendid. Thudio will be checking out the wolves' mouths. Specifically, the teeth.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if dire wolf teeth are a thing. It's not like a standard item, but you can remove some of their teeth, if you would like.

[Speaker 4]
He doesn't want them, he's just going to be looking at them.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yeah, they're sharp. Not vampiric levels of sharp, though.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe they're just a subtype.

[Speaker 2]
Just a rather aggressive bat.

[Speaker 1]
As you get to there, you hear the heavy footsteps. You have to sort of climb down this little incline. And you see a big boy walk past.

He doesn't pay you any notice, though.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, by the way, I have this.

[Speaker 5]
You have what? I'd love that. Alright, well, she'll just point like...

I know for sure there's skeletons in that direction. They're preoccupied. Ah, delightful!

Okay. Preoccupied? This is a question.

They didn't notice me or didn't care?

[Speaker 2]
Probably for the best. If we can get away without fighting them. And do more exploration, all's the better.

Here we go.

[Speaker 7]
The cannon!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, do you wish to go first again?

[Speaker 5]
I also see... Otterbearby? Yeah, it sounded like she had to leave.

I don't know if Otterbearby had a seizure or something.

[Speaker 1]
We might just take five then. I might go get a drink.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I shall make hot chocolate. It shall be called chocolate.

[Speaker 7]
Um, I'm back.

[Speaker 3]
Are you coming? Is everything okay? Uh, yeah, that was the worst seizure he's ever had.

He was like... He's fine now, he's still a little twitchy, but... He was like, actually...

Throwing himself around the bed, and I was worried that he was going to fall down the stairs.

[Speaker 7]
Holy crap. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3]
He was getting some air.

[Speaker 7]
That's so scary.

[Speaker 3]
And he is COVERED in piss. Naturally.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, baby!

[Speaker 3]
And I have to wait until he's not twitching anymore before I can give him some more medicine. Because when he's like this, he's not going to eat. So he's currently in my arms, wrapped up in a bunch of towels, because I don't really feel like being covered in piss either.

[Speaker 5]
We ended up taking a break, so you didn't miss anything.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I felt kind of bad.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's an understandable reason, but... Half of me not being there was me trying to get him to freaking let go of the blanket, too.

[Speaker 7]
Aww.

[Speaker 3]
Because somehow he bit the blanket, and then he started to come out of the seizure, and was like, No, this blanket's not leaving my mouth. Oh, but I want to walk away. Oh, but the blanket's not leaving my mouth.

So I had to pry his mouth open. Now he's drooling on me. What sucks is I literally just gave him his medicine an hour ago.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's... that's really weird. Well, I think I know what it is.

Did you hear about the princess sheep that was murdered by the evil queen?

[Speaker 7]
Huh?

[Speaker 5]
The sheep princess was murdered by the evil queen.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, no. Do tell. No, no, you're staying here, bud.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, the sheep princess came back to life, so everything's okay. That's all.

[Speaker 1]
If we're happy to keep going, you can move your tokens about.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah. We decided to go up this way, because there's definitely skeletal beings, so they didn't really care about what it was. Which direction were they heading in when you spotted them?

Started over...

[Speaker 7]
Oh, hang on, sorry.

[Speaker 5]
Oh! Yeah, started over here, and then walked this way. Fascinating.

Yeah, just like that. I think, well, we should probably see where they're coming from then. Oh, I can't.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have James back?

[Speaker 5]
He's in the bathroom. He said to continue on without him. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Poor guy, fighting for his life in there.

[Speaker 1]
Where the real skeleton war is happening.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, was that an 11 minute seizure?

[Speaker 7]
Was that gone for 11 minutes? Fighting for my life.

[Speaker 5]
Is this just, like, different soldiers going past? You'd have to kill them to see.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so, one plant, follow behind that one. Second plant, go the opposite direction.

[Speaker 5]
Third plant. We split up. Oh, no, it's going around in a circle.

[Speaker 2]
I see, so it must be patrolling.

[Speaker 7]
Ah, he lives. Oh, well there's multiple.

[Speaker 5]
Exciting. This is hilarious.

[Speaker 3]
You doing okay, bud?

[Speaker 7]
There we go.

[Speaker 2]
That is an explosive barrel.

[Speaker 4]
Is it red? It is red. Give me a stealth check.

[Speaker 2]
Do I also have to do a stealth check here?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Entering the path of the march.

[Speaker 2]
I was going to be out of it, but alas. Wall collision.

[Speaker 1]
You get out of the way, but Cecilia is going to start combat with this guy.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, bet. I can take him. You guys just sit back.

In a fight?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Based on this, I don't think you can just take that one guy.

[Speaker 4]
How many guys am I taking at once?

[Speaker 7]
It's like that one guy. Oh, no. Five guys.

How many you got?

[Speaker 2]
Five guys, the famous restaurant.

[Speaker 7]
Did you say the famous restaurant?

[Speaker 6]
Five guys.

[Speaker 5]
Five different fries.

[Speaker 7]
I'm definitely banning you.

[Speaker 2]
Do you not like five guys? I'm an in-and-out person.

[Speaker 1]
It's okay. In-and-out. Come on, I'm in Texas.

We do Whataburger here.

[Speaker 4]
We're getting our first Whataburger just in time. I just started eating meat again, and we're getting our first Whataburger.

[Speaker 7]
I've never heard of a Whataburger before, so I can't judge.

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 7]
You've already upgraded to five guys.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, listen. In my defense, there is neither in-and-out nor Whataburger. It was five guys and nothing else.

[Speaker 5]
Hang on.

[Speaker 2]
The other options are like McDonald's.

[Speaker 5]
Doesn't that roll?

[Speaker 2]
I thought I rolled. Are we re-rolling? Are we in combat?

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you'll need to roll initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, god.

[Speaker 1]
It's okay.

[Speaker 4]
Can I re-roll my initiative?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 7]
But you can use your...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you can with the hero point, yes. You can also use your... Oh, yes.

[Speaker 4]
That would be nice. Recall knowledge. Recall knowledge.

Recall knowledge. Where is this?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wow.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wow?

[Speaker 1]
You're all but one.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 3]
One means that she knows exactly what it is, right?

[Speaker 1]
This specific skeleton hates you. He stole your wallet one day or something. You're pretty sure?

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Well, he's dying. Also, I'm supposed to have two... I didn't know what to do with it.

I'm supposed to have two lore skills specific to the undead. I didn't know what to do with that, so...

[Speaker 1]
So, in your proficiencies, down the bottom, under the core skills is the lore skills. You need to put them in there. You need to type in blank lore and add that to trained or whatever from your feed.

And then when you do recall knowledge, it'll query those as well. Oh, okay. So, what sort of undead would you like to be?

You could pick, like, vampire lore, for example.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think I'm going to do... Oh, is it not just specifically undead? Or is it specifically what gives her that?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I'll ping the...

[Speaker 3]
There's, like, vampire lore and, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Something else to learn.

[Speaker 4]
I'll do spirits. Okay. Because it does interact with that.

[Speaker 1]
So now, for example, if you're fighting, like, dampers, you would have a really good chance of knowing about them compared to someone who isn't trained. How'd Mimosa get there?

[Speaker 4]
If I do vampires, does that cover dampers as well?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It realistically would. Unless you were doing something really specific, but even then, using vampire lore would still be better than doing, like, an arcana check or religion, for example, in my opinion.

Covers a lot of undead. I think that's good.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um, anyway, this guy's going to bait the shit out of me.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah! Yay! Is he going to throw her around and...

Sorry, throw Susudio around until he sticks to a wall like those, like, dummy toys.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 5]
And he just, like, flops down.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, he misses.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Misses? He misses all three.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yes. He's doing, like, cool monk dodges.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Funny option is he's just sitting there with a blank frog stare.

[Speaker 2]
I wonder how explosive these explosives are. Do you want to find out? Yes!

If it means we get rid of the giants faster.

[Speaker 1]
This guy, um, comes back from his path and whacks you.

[Speaker 4]
Jeez. Ow, jeez. No.

Jeez, what was I doing?

[Speaker 7]
I was right, those guys hit hard.

[Speaker 4]
Um, alright, well, I'm unconscious. GG's.

[Speaker 1]
Susudio's turn moves to in front of the, uh, giants.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, do I need to do a death save? Not yet. Uh, remember healing?

[Speaker 1]
Uh. They sort of go to eat, uh, oh no, you're still alive, never mind. Pretend I didn't say anything.

They're definitely ignoring the rest of you, though. They look like they're about to kill Susudio, like, they're gonna BM, you know?

[Speaker 2]
Alright, um, well, what would be the action to pick him up and haul butt?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that'd be like a shove action, probably.

[Speaker 2]
I'm also small, so. Okay, like, so can I just, like, put you underneath my arm, and then we walk somewhere else, and then I fire something at these guys?

[Speaker 1]
Um, action economy doesn't really let you drag well.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, darn.

[Speaker 1]
It'd probably, let's look at shove. Well, darn. With an action, you can move them ten feet away.

[Speaker 2]
That is still within the path of the skeleton giants. Well, Susudio, uh, don't die, I'll try and heal you then, instead.

[Speaker 7]
Don't forget, Susudio.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god, no, potions, potions. Okay. Yeah, I don't have healing magic, but I do have potions.

[Speaker 4]
Oh god, why does everything look so weird?

[Speaker 1]
You're dying.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it would be that. Alright, so, versatile vial, our beloved. We're going to use one of those.

Once I find the bloody thing. Alright. There we go.

I have to manually hit the make button, so that it actually appears in the inventory, so.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Am I bad? Can you be hungry?

Can you be hungry?

[Speaker 2]
Please use the elixir of life, dear Susudio. You have to click it yourself.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, it's not working.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, let me just roll it, and then you can heal. Three, that's fine. There you go.

I hope you got the effect elixir of life. And you should be at three.

[Speaker 4]
You live! Okay. I live, I'm not dying anymore.

Yay, and now we see if these guys can die.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. Thank you. You are- well, you're welcome.

Good enough.

[Speaker 1]
As you attack him, he turns to face you now. You are clearly in his attention.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, joy! That's my turn.

[Speaker 4]
Farah? Can't wait to get hit again.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops, I skipped. Farah.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Well, um, which one did Bakobasha attack? This one?

The left one. The one- yeah. I would like to do a recall knowledge on it.

Because I want to know what its weakest save is.

[Speaker 1]
Their weakest save is will. Skeletons are typically given a purpose if they're mindless like this, and they tend to stick to that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm going to... what am I going to do? Don't have a lot of great options.

I'm going to shake its bones. Two actions.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops, I didn't roll the save. Um.

[Speaker 3]
Don't have high hopes for that. Oh, okay. Get shook.

[Speaker 1]
With that, um, Farah, you get his attention as well.

[Speaker 3]
And unfortunately, that is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops, I keep clicking end turn. This skeleton.

[Speaker 3]
Would you like to eat some food, please?

[Speaker 1]
Um. Dr. Bakobasha hasn't attacked that one. Although, Dr. Bakobasha did attack the skeleton in the patrol.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, for crying out loud.

[Speaker 1]
I think Dr. Bakobasha's going to get hit.

[Speaker 7]
Rude!

[Speaker 2]
Okay, give me one second as I just, uh... Okay. Just to reduce the damage a little.

[Speaker 1]
Harmless to five hit points, so it reduces the damage you take by seven. Is that how this works? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Reduces it by seven, and if it goes through, it's by a further two. So by nine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
So I'll just take the damage, then...

[Speaker 1]
Give yourself nine hit points after, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Damage. How?

[Speaker 5]
Nine. Alright.

[Speaker 7]
Okay!

[Speaker 1]
Mikanin, it is your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Perhaps they're being paid as well.

[Speaker 7]
I don't think it'd be amazing if... Gotta put myself... Ah!

Oh! What are you trying to do?

[Speaker 6]
Do I smack him?

[Speaker 7]
Sure.

[Speaker 3]
First, I'm gonna give him a little... A bit of the old...

[Speaker 6]
Bit of the old... Oh. That's unfortunate.

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Well.

[Speaker 1]
Um... I think Mikanin would know not to feint a skeleton. Skeletons are mindless, typically.

Which makes them immune to mental effects.

[Speaker 2]
Demoralizing.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe he wouldn't know that.

[Speaker 6]
What we'll do... Is give him a little smack with the... Okay.

With a little strategy. And mark him... As being an off-guard.

With my motion.

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Which one's off-guard to you, this one?

[Speaker 1]
Mikanin doing anything else.

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Are we supposed to be pulling the frog out? It's okay.

[Speaker 2]
I healed the frog. So, the frog can run. If it doesn't get hit.

Again. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... It probably will.

[Speaker 7]
Smack!

[Speaker 5]
Neat.

[Speaker 3]
We kill it?

[Speaker 5]
Come here, stupid graveyard. Um, I guess...

[Speaker 3]
Oh jeez. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I did great damage. Um... If I want to get over here...

Do I have to tumble through it?

[Speaker 1]
You would have to tumble through. And each square of his is difficult terrain.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. What if I like... Sneaked up here?

Went down here.

[Speaker 1]
No, you can't tumble through this one, unfortunately. It's like a wall. You would need to tumble through at least one of his squares.

[Speaker 5]
Well, she's got mom hips, so she could probably squeeze through that. Okay, um... That sucks.

[Speaker 3]
Wouldn't mom hips mean you couldn't squeeze through that? Because that's what happens to the Pixar moms?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I said she may have it, but I'm sure she could squeeze through it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Mimosas are small, right? And they're, uh, large? Mimosas are very funny.

[Speaker 2]
Can Mimosas squeeze through because their size is smaller?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you can move through the space of a creature three sizes larger than you. Without tumbling.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, three.

[Speaker 1]
What the hell? Or you'd need to be... Pixie.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, fine. Do I have to tumble through the dead guy, or can I, like...

[Speaker 1]
Um... No, but if any motor skeletons end up on those squares, they'll be difficult terrain.

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Can I do that?

[Speaker 1]
You can do that one without a tumble through, but to get to here you will need to tumble through.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll tumble through. Only one, though, right? Ugh.

I've got a chance. Okay, so I basically get, like, here?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... You still have to move your full speed, it's just that the square costs two.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay. So... So then I can get 25?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 6]
Cool.

[Speaker 1]
I think. Probably it's fine.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Which way would he go? Hmm... He gets to there.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that card actually saves the studio's life.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so that's... Useless. Alright, cool.

Um... You... I'm gonna...

You know what, I think I'm gonna punch one and then run. Um... Oh god.

Actually, no, I need to get up. I'll use an action to get up.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And then I will run. It's too far. We'll see.

Alright.

[Speaker 1]
As you move 15 feet from the hallway that they're patrolling, they... You lose their interest. And they start focusing on the other people that have attacked them.

[Speaker 7]
Oh!

[Speaker 4]
I think this is a... A territory thing. Okay, okay.

They were told specifically to guard this part. Um... And then I will end my turn, because I am not about to die.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm...

[Speaker 4]
Actually, did I have one more, um... Did I have one more? I used a potion, I got up, and I ran.

No, I did not have one more.

[Speaker 1]
I actually think you're short on action. I guess you could have been holding the potion. You would have dropped the potion, though, when you went unconscious.

Do you have a quick draw?

[Speaker 4]
Look for the broken shards. No, but I can also just pretend I didn't take the potion, and take away for healing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I'm happy to let you do that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Would you like to spend your last action doing something else?

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Um... Yeah, recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Um... I don't know what kind of information I can try.

[Speaker 1]
Cecilia, you're certain they won't, um, leave their path if the party gets away from it?

[Speaker 4]
I will relay that knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Hmm... He has the reach to hit Makanan or Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 2]
Could you not hit me? Please?

[Speaker 1]
Since you asked, I guess I'll target Makanan.

[Speaker 4]
Thanks! That never happens! Amazing.

What a reasonable mindset.

[Speaker 1]
Never mind. It can hit you both. It has its broad swipe feature.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Delightful. That is so fun.

[Speaker 1]
This is Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 7]
Praise be.

[Speaker 1]
Hits Makanan. Oh, sorry, I've targeted... Hang on.

There we go. I've targeted Makanan for that damage.

[Speaker 2]
Bless you.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I'm just dying. Very good. Dr. Basha, it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. After getting that wonderfully relayed message, I'm just going to... Oh, I have the measure tool on.

I'm just gonna take a step... Actually, no, let me fight them first before retreating.

[Speaker 6]
These guys...

[Speaker 2]
I imagine there are a lot of rocks on the floor, right?

[Speaker 7]
Yep. Heaps.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. I'm just gonna... We can only get two of these guys, that's fine.

Doing those two in particular. And then... Roll damage.

Not so good, not so good. And then with my last action, I am moving away.

[Speaker 1]
It's when you get to that point that they stop aggroing on you. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Hera, it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, did they... Ah, they did take their damage. Okay, good.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna take a step back.

[Speaker 1]
Good choice.

[Speaker 3]
And that gives me two actions. Gosh, I wish I had Friend Fetch. Unfortunately, I don't know if I can get Friend Fetch, or what level that is.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Friend Fetch is a level 1 spell, so you can get it next time. Is it?

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Is it just not divine? It is arcane and occult. So Hera can never have the Friend Fetch, sad.

[Speaker 2]
Alas, alas.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe I'll dip into a multi-class for it. I'm just going to... Relax back here.

I don't think I have anything that's gonna be useful. Unfortunately.

[Speaker 1]
He's deciding who he should kill. Hmm. Mechanon's within reach.

Marissa went behind him.

[Speaker 7]
She's a target.

[Speaker 6]
It's for Marissa. If she's hiding behind me, obviously she's a weaker target.

[Speaker 7]
Therefore...

[Speaker 5]
I'm not hiding behind you. I'm over here by the barrel. Oh!

How dare you.

[Speaker 2]
Pick the barrel into the skeleton. Blow him up.

[Speaker 5]
That's what I was going to do, but now I'm really close to the skeleton. Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to take a swing at you, Marissa.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
I have nimble dodge. I think that's a plus... B plus 2, and you hit me with that thing.

[Speaker 1]
You can save your reaction for the second attack he's doing at you.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah? Can I?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can use it there. I don't think it changes anything. Do you get to position?

[Speaker 5]
It doesn't change anything!

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Alright. Which one's this one?

It's behind his friend. He has to move out. What square is Mechanon in?

[Speaker 7]
There's a wall there, so...

[Speaker 1]
I can't move your token.

[Speaker 7]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Can he get there? He's pretty quick. Difficult terrain.

It's all difficult terrain. He's got one action left. He's going to attack Mechanon.

With a crit. Easy. Wow, I'm so good at GMing.

Fight for Giant Skeleton.

[Speaker 2]
Ow. It's being curled, but it's also ow.

[Speaker 1]
Holy shit. I already moved your turn because I thought you were dead. That's awesome!

Okay, it's your turn, Mechanon. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 7]
Well, it's Entity's Resurgence.

[Speaker 3]
To know what this... I know that technically the Entity controls your turns.

[Speaker 6]
So I'm just going to need you to...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the Entity.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I've got about three different books for you to read. On his objectives and such. Which you're not allowed to use for your plans for Rana.

[Speaker 1]
That means you just get GM knowledge. Okay. Mechanon points his gun down the hallway and shoots a barrel.

[Speaker 7]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
No, wait, hang on! Not yours.

[Speaker 1]
This one down here. Mechanon can't even see it, but the Entity knows. I don't even have to roll to attack.

The Entity knows. And it explodes. The barrel is charred.

So he takes half. There's lovely fire down this bit of the hallway. And then...

Mechanon is going to get out of there. The Entity is in control for one minute. They see.

No, they're not. You would need one tumble through to get out of here.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry. You were washing your hands? Okay, I moved.

I'm going to pull out... My Alchemist fire. Oh, and I'm going to re-roll that.

Huzzah! And I throw it at the barrel!

[Speaker 1]
Okay, hear me out. If you target the skeleton with that, the splash damage will set off the barrel.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, cool. Would I have hit him all the same?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you would have. So, you're on the 20.

[Speaker 5]
Hopefully I'm far enough away.

[Speaker 1]
It is persistent. The barrel explodes in a... 10-foot radius.

So I believe you're safe back there. Hang on, that was not the right...

[Speaker 2]
The barrel succeeds at saving her against itself.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to take half.

[Speaker 5]
I'm far enough away.

[Speaker 1]
And the ground is on fire.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

[Speaker 1]
Well... He takes a bunch of fire damage getting to there.

[Speaker 6]
Why are they over here? Leave me alone! What the hell?

[Speaker 2]
This field's outside his parameters.

[Speaker 5]
This is bullshit.

[Speaker 2]
Don't die, Ms. Mimosa, that would be most unfortunate.

[Speaker 5]
It would. It really, really would. Make her come back if it does block.

[Speaker 1]
He has resistance 5, so he gets 10 hit points back.

[Speaker 5]
Do I have... Is he on... Is it on fire?

Is there a flaming skeleton coming at me?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he's walking through a bunch of, like, burning oil.

[Speaker 5]
Metal.

[Speaker 1]
I think he can still just reach you, though. He can't squeeze up into where you are, but he can still reach you. Cool.

[Speaker 5]
Is this, by chance, like a window I can squeeze through?

[Speaker 1]
It's a very narrow path. You could squeeze in there and he... Did you have movement left?

[Speaker 5]
I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. You do have cover from him being where you are, so...

[Speaker 5]
I think I did. Yeah, I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
He misses.

[Speaker 2]
Come back, you said deskwalker. He misses.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I'm near death.

[Speaker 1]
Correct.

[Speaker 5]
I'm the same.

[Speaker 1]
Let me draw in some fire.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I will take... I guess, would that be two actions to use this now?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yes.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on. Healing potion's vitality. So I can't use it, right?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. Let's see. No, vitality's okay.

It's if it's positive healing effects. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, cool, cool, cool. You got maximum from the potion. Nice.

Healing.

[Speaker 7]
Yay!

[Speaker 4]
So that was two actions?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yes.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, my last action will be... Reflective ripple stance.

[Speaker 1]
Um, you would be winded one. As well, from when you went down.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Um, okay.

[Speaker 4]
I want to help Mimosa, but I don't know what to do.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god, why?! Go away!

[Speaker 1]
I wasn't meant to be targeted at McKinnon. I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
If there's anything that would miss by one or something, I'm using my swimming nimble. Gosh. In the trash.

Is that the target?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they're taking... No, no one hit McKinnon, sorry. They're taking on severe heat damage from walking in there.

He physically can't get into where Mimosa is, though. Dr. Butcher, it's your turn.

[Speaker 2]
I won't move that close, I just... Hold on. Ah, I'm stuck.

Between a rock and a hard place. Give me a second. Yes, babe.

There's still... There is still one guy in front of us, which is very unfortunate. Am I able to move past him without tumbling through?

Yes, you can move into his square. Cool, cool. He's that wise.

One hit from him and I'll die. I'll try to get rid of the other. This one first.

[Speaker 4]
If the one that had just moved hadn't been right there, I would have gone this way to lead him away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay. You know what?

Let's go this way and try to... That would be unwise. Again.

No, I'm not. I don't have enough running movement to outrun this nerd. Okay.

So, we're just fighting him. Joy! That's fine.

That's okay. I hate that they moved. This is genuinely bothering me now.

[Speaker 5]
I... I hate that they moved too. Okay.

What's the matter?

[Speaker 2]
We're re-rolling that. Still a miss. Ouch.

And then... Stick. Miss.

Alas. That is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Para, it is your turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. What's the goal right now? Are we trying to kill it or are we trying to do a rescue mission?

[Speaker 5]
Either or. I mean, right now Mimosa is cornered by three.

[Speaker 2]
And there's one in our path.

[Speaker 3]
Is Mimosa stuck where she's at? Like, she can't come this way?

[Speaker 5]
No, I... Here, let me take a screenshot. It's pretty bad.

[Speaker 3]
No. I'm gonna not look at it right now.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Oh, I don't want to do an emanation. Why would you ever do a 30-foot emanation on Concordant Choir?

When are you ever 30 feet away from any of your compartments? I guess when you're a bard. Bards are always far away from their friends because they're like, oh, you're gonna give us buffs?

Let's go all the way on the other side of the map. Anyway. That's not something I've dealt with in a while.

I'm going to... I'm going to use Concordant Choir. And there's not much of a point to not do the one-action version.

Because there's only one guy here. Oh, no, I'm gonna do the two-action version.

[Speaker 6]
It does more damage. Man, that's such a level one spell.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Dr. Basha, you're not undead, correct?

[Speaker 2]
I'm not undead, yes. As far as I'm aware, anyway.

[Speaker 3]
Then I'm going to give you a touch. And Meccanon, have you taken damage? Oh, Meccanon's near death.

I'm actually going to touch... Yes, I'm going to touch Meccanon. And then Dr. Basha can take two hit points.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. He wants to get... No, I submit he can't.

I think he just stands on fire for a round.

[Speaker 2]
That's very helpful, Mimosa. Technically based. You don't get hit, they burn.

It's a win-win.

[Speaker 1]
They are resisting this fire.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, they're only taking half damage.

[Speaker 6]
No! Stop it!

[Speaker 2]
Resistance is in points. So either they're resisting by five, or by ten, or by three.

[Speaker 3]
One of them. Ah, but you can't see that.

[Speaker 1]
Meccanon, it's your turn. No it isn't, it's the Entity's turn.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. The Willow of the Deep is probably most interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Dispel a few more of these.

[Speaker 1]
I think you're just going to be shooting at this skeleton at the back from where you are. Fucking weird fate. Entity's Resist.

[Speaker 2]
I guess that's the one bonus from getting a Horrifying.

[Speaker 1]
How would you like to do your attack rolls? Very good. Mimosa!

You can crawl back further into the hole where they won't be able to reach you, or you could try and Dumble through all of them, and also take the fire damage associated with this.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to crawl into this hole. Alright. Alright.

[Speaker 5]
Um, that's, hang on honey. That's what, go, okay. Go get the tablet in the hall.

Okay. Um, and then...

[Speaker 1]
Do you wish to do anything to them from there?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm going to... Ba-ba-ba-ba-blast. I'm going to...

Ba-ba-ba-ba-blast.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not going to do anything.

[Speaker 5]
It's hard to do with one hand.

[Speaker 2]
Why is this guy coming back?

[Speaker 1]
He returns to his patrol now that he can't do anything, unless he died. Hang on. He didn't die.

Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
Pity.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, combat ends. You haven't beaten them yet, so I'm going to give you half of the XP for this, but I think you've pretty much worked out how to do it.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, what am I supposed to do?

[Speaker 5]
What can I do?

[Speaker 1]
Skeleton's walked away. The fire's burnt out. If you would like to return to the party...

[Speaker 3]
Did McKanan ever take his healing?

[Speaker 1]
McKanan, you're in control of your body, eventually. Oh, I'm going to move you out.

[Speaker 5]
Well, that was unpleasant.

[Speaker 2]
It was, but now we know how to defeat them without getting... stabbed. If as long as we...

Mimosa, you are standing too close. As long as we stay a little bit away from the tunnel and hit them as they pass, they shan't get us. So we can wait as they move.

Hit them, wait till they move. It'll take a bit, but we'll wear them down. I started dreaming of trees.

Yes, we are quite alright, Mr. McKanan. Mostly. I started dreaming of trees.

Are you all there? Move closer to see if there's anything funky going with your vision.

[Speaker 5]
Just like, could you... Just look this way. Get the flashlight out, check your pupils.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Terrible first headache. Well, everything seems relatively normal, but... you might want to take a rest after.

It did seem you were acting a bit oddly, so perhaps... Perhaps it was your inner will, or what have you. Anyway, we should wait for the skeletons to come by, and then...

I guess throw rocks at them.

[Speaker 4]
Could we perhaps take a rest?

[Speaker 2]
Would be a wiser decision. I'm quite wounded. Ah, but they won't hit you if you stay out of their way.

But, fair enough, perhaps we should heal in case they change their mind on their roll.

[Speaker 1]
Is that how you're deciding to deal with the giant skeletons? Just attacking them as they march past?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yeah, it's the smartest thing to do.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I'm not going to do any rolls for that, because that's really boring and will take ages. So I'm just going to say they're all dead in the way. And I'm going to give all the rest of you XP.

Oh my god, I clicked the players button.

[Speaker 6]
Too many players.

[Speaker 2]
Have a joyous day. They have perished. Uh, giant bones.

[Speaker 7]
Well, you took the...

[Speaker 1]
It was meant to be a level 3 encounter, but the way you did it I think quantifies as a level 4 encounter. Maybe even worse, Para didn't really suffer. I'm going to give you all double XP.

Para doesn't get double XP, everyone else does.

[Speaker 2]
Huzzah. A win's a win. Apologies, Para.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to give the rest of you an additional 160.

[Speaker 5]
I level up. I was going to level up anyway, unless it was under 100.

[Speaker 1]
Let me kill these skeletons. Yes. That was half of the XP for the people below the level.

So, for the people that are below level 4, they should have got 320 XP for that.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, but you're 10 under the pool number. 10 above the pool number.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you can now safely navigate the maze. There are several more explosive barrels in there.

[Speaker 2]
How delightful.

[Speaker 4]
We should probably activate them from a distance or be very, very, very careful. Can we drag the stuff, like the loot that they have, into our party stash?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can steal their glaives and their giant half-plate.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. It'll make a lot of money then.

[Speaker 1]
Giant half-plate would weigh a lot.

[Speaker 2]
We can drag them out after the adventure's done then.

[Speaker 1]
So half-plate normally weighs 3 bulk, and I think being large it doubles. So it would be 6 bulk per set of glaives.

[Speaker 7]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Which I think is like two-thirds of the bulk a character has typically. But it's not going anywhere, so you can leave it there for now and haul it out when you're done.

[Speaker 2]
Well, off we go. I'm going to see the path that we're walking. Oh, right!

Mr. McCannon, would you like to go in front?

[Speaker 4]
How do I get rid of this wounded one?

[Speaker 3]
You have to spend like 10 minutes at full health, I think.

[Speaker 1]
Or treat wounds, does.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but she's undead and I think you have to have stitch flesh.

[Speaker 2]
Does the studio not have flesh to stitch?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there you go. Stitch flesh. Didn't know that.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if the rest of you shall be hanging behind, I'll reluctantly take the lead. Unless we're taking a small break to make sure that we're all in tip-top shape.

[Speaker 3]
It's probably better to try and make sure everyone's in good shape.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know if there's anything that can be done for me.

[Speaker 3]
Again, won't treat wounds work since you do have flesh to stitch? That's not what it is. I think it's like any creature that is undead benefits can't have, like, has to have stitch flesh.

I think because she is a dampier that it still requires it. Okay. Which I think is silly, but oh well.

It makes sense for things like ghosts, but for a dampier I feel like I should be able to treat the wounds.

[Speaker 1]
So negative healing only says that you aren't healed by positive healing effects.

[Speaker 3]
What is stitch flesh specifically for?

[Speaker 4]
I am half undead and half living, so it doesn't say anywhere that I am undead. It just says that I'm half undead and half living.

[Speaker 7]
Undead creatures.

[Speaker 4]
As if you were undead. Okay, so you're fine with everything else then. Should I only take, like, half since I'm half dead?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like, that's the hard part. Does that really count as a living creature? I guess that's a landy call.

[Speaker 1]
Let's avoid healing.

[Speaker 4]
I never technically died, he was born this way.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Oh. Um.

So I remember how you said that your healing potions would hurt you. And I said no, like a wrong idiot.

[Speaker 4]
Great, so I'm still at three. Wonderful. You get the potion back.

[Speaker 1]
So we can see in the dampier heritage that you, so specifically you get void healing. Uh, and that's the only relevant bit here. So you have the void healing ability.

Void healing is...

[Speaker 4]
Like, I have that inherently?

[Speaker 1]
A creature with void healing draws health from void energy, rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by healing vitality effects. So your potions don't hurt you, but they don't heal you.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So at least you get the potion back, since I imagine Susudio wouldn't know that.

[Speaker 1]
So I believe the spell Soothe doesn't have the vitality trait.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um, but the cleric spell Heal does. So Para would have to tell us how.

[Speaker 3]
And my healing gloves specifically say they're a healing vitality trait as well. I just can't hurt Para. But I can treat wounds, which is normal healing, and I can do four people at one time.

But that kind of comes down to the... Would Landy consider a dampier an undead person, or a living one?

[Speaker 4]
It does say I'm half undead, half living.

[Speaker 1]
Um, let's look at ghost. Not ghost, what about zombie? Or skeleton.

[Speaker 3]
Skeleton's an ancestry.

[Speaker 1]
They have basic undead benefits. They have the same?

[Speaker 3]
Basic undead benefits.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to say you would need Stitch Flesh to heal, to treat wounds.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, Susudio is on their own. I can treat everyone else's wounds. Is it just one roll for everyone, or is it one roll per person still?

[Speaker 1]
With Ward Medic?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's one roll for everyone, I think. Because I think it's when you treat wounds, you do multiple with that one check. If you think you're certain it's the other, then I'm not going to die on that hill.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, no, it's two people, because I am not a master yet, so it's only two people at a time. We'll start with the two more injured people that I can actively heal. You both get 25.

Much appreciated, Damper. And then McCannon, you get your own treat wounds, and you get 15. Oh, wait, I did the wrong one.

Oh well. Is 15 good enough? 15 is good enough.

You can have the baby heal. And then I don't really have anything I can do for Susudio, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4]
I have to wait until Mother's healing. I could just, like, leave and go to the nearest town and get some Hoidi healing.

[Speaker 2]
I could also feed you my versatile vials if that would help. Because they don't have vitality.

[Speaker 4]
It would be Elixir of Life. I have 32 max HP. It might just be worth me leaving, going to the nearest town, and getting some things.

Because I bought potions thinking I could use them.

[Speaker 1]
You can refund your potions.

[Speaker 4]
I don't remember how many I bought and how many I've used. You can check your inventory. I only had one, but I think I used some beforehand.

I think I'm gonna... how far away is the nearest town?

[Speaker 1]
That's for unlock, it's like a couple hours walk.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're fine getting back to Braumok. You could buy Spell Scrolls of Harm. Would be the easiest way I could think of getting you healed.

But then Pera would have to cast them before you.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I can do that. Isn't there, like, a specific thing for undead healing?

[Speaker 7]
I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
That's Harm.

[Speaker 4]
Oil of Unlife.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that does restore hit points. James, how common are magic items that heal undead in Braumok? Not reasonably.

[Speaker 4]
I probably have, like, a back alley source. Come on!

[Speaker 3]
I feel like Elixirs of Life might be easier to come by.

[Speaker 1]
Elixirs of Life have vitality, though, don't they?

[Speaker 3]
No, they're mundane. It's just, you gain hit points.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay, healing potions don't work, Elixirs of Life do work.

[Speaker 3]
Good to know. Yeah, those are the mundane ones. Alchemical.

[Speaker 1]
You wouldn't have any trouble buying those.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, we'll do Elixir then.

[Speaker 1]
That's probably how Vaar's earning income at the moment.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
There are also slightly more expensive- oh, nevermind, there's a level 5. I was gonna say, there's these as well, but they're 30 and they're more expensive.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, I don't know about that one.

[Speaker 1]
Dragged back with a set of giant plate armor.

[Speaker 4]
So how long does it take for me to get to Braumok and then back? How does that interact with the party?

[Speaker 1]
You're gone for like 4 hours. What do the rest of you want to do whilst this video goes to town and heals?

[Speaker 2]
I'll do a little exploration and then immediately turn tail if I end up smacking into something.

[Speaker 7]
Just like, wander.

[Speaker 3]
But what if it follows you? I mean, just because these guys didn't, doesn't mean the rest of them won't. You got to a good point.

[Speaker 2]
And sort of just like, goes back. He'll be looking at the bones then. Wow, I wonder what made these.

[Speaker 1]
They're like minotaur skeletons, from what you can tell.

[Speaker 2]
When we're on the way back, he will take the bones. Can't right now, too heavy. But, ciao.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, come on.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Um, Para would have time for many more treat wounds. In this time period.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, is anyone still injured?

[Speaker 1]
I think she would have them back to full. I'm not even going to let you roll through. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
We're Gucci, guys.

[Speaker 1]
You can go out to the front of the cave and have like a picnic for a bit.

[Speaker 3]
Mimosa certainly would have all the food for it.

[Speaker 1]
Have a nap. Cicudio shows up again eventually, having chugged like six potions on the warp pad.

[Speaker 4]
How are you doing there, Cicudio? Oh, so much better.

[Speaker 3]
Do you think if you drink enough potions it makes you have to pee?

[Speaker 4]
Probably. He had to stop a couple of times.

[Speaker 5]
Is it like vitamins where you pee out health? It's like ketamine.

[Speaker 3]
Just a bright green-yellow.

[Speaker 4]
So one of the defense mechanisms for frogs and toads is peeing. I can't count how many times I've been peed on by a fucking toad. Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
Pathfinder feet when? Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
You know what they say about 500 toads? A lot of kids.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, hey, there is in fact a spell of 500 toads. I think my lady said it. Yes, yes, yes.

No, no, no.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, after like five hours you get back to dungeon exploring. Skeletons are all still dead.

[Speaker 4]
Cicudio's got like a beard shed. I think it would be to lick these.

[Speaker 5]
The bones?

[Speaker 2]
I mean you can try, they are just bones. Your tongue will stick to them for a while. That's what happens when you lick bones.

Yeah, because they're dry. What do you mean?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, yes. If it's a rock, it doesn't stick. So like, you know, the residual magic could do some funky stuff.

Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Please feel free to do so. I would love to see what happens.

[Speaker 3]
Well no, as I say, it might not be safe.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Fair enough.

[Speaker 3]
Then just step carefully over them.

[Speaker 2]
Tripping over it would be a bit uncouth. Onwards. Mechanon, don't forget to keep up.

Your light source will leave.

[Speaker 3]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Are we going this way? Which way are we going?

[Speaker 3]
Dr. Dash is going to the right.

[Speaker 4]
Where does the team wish to go? Right it is.

[Speaker 1]
Moving all my skeletons out of the way.

[Speaker 2]
We're all just a layer beneath. We have no choice.

[Speaker 3]
Just stay at the corner. Otherwise Mechanon will get lost.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa would be at full health now. From all of the resting done. I just don't want you to die.

I'm doing...

[Speaker 5]
I'm not going to leave.

[Speaker 1]
How'd you go with your level up? Did you have any trouble?

[Speaker 5]
Um, I'm still, I'm still like going through it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
No, not yet. Oh, where to? That is a rogue.

It's really...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Mechanon's going for us. This way it is then.

Ah, another barrel. Where's Mechanon leading us?

[Speaker 1]
From the north he hears more sounds of combat.

[Speaker 2]
It's okay. The skeletons will be mostly on our side.

[Speaker 5]
You should be concerned that he's... Mechanon? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, he said it was a tree inside him. Sort of, I guess, symbiotic parasitic relationship. It doesn't seem to be causing undue harm.

So, it should be fine. But if it does run the risk of, you know, killing him. We'll probably have to do something about that.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, it took ages to get here.

[Speaker 5]
If you swallow an apple tree, an apple seed, it does start growing inside of you.

[Speaker 2]
My dear, that is not how it works at all. Your stomach's far too strong. Alright, um.

So, as we go forward, do we see where the source, uh, what the skeleton is fighting?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you do. I just reorganized it to consider how much time has passed since they started fighting. Uh, I need to change all the skeletons, Alliance.

Are you going to help the skeletons?

[Speaker 2]
Hell yes, and then convince them not to deglove us.

[Speaker 3]
Deglove is such a lovely word.

[Speaker 7]
It really is, isn't it?

[Speaker 3]
And it's a very good descriptor of what happens. There's a witch that's degloving herself from the art. Sorry, what?

In the Pathfinder stuff. There's a hag that is degloving herself. Oh!

[Speaker 2]
That sounds unpleasant, but also fascinating. Alright, uh.

[Speaker 1]
If you're going to interject in this fight, you can add yourselves to initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Well, we can see who wins.

[Speaker 1]
You can just wait out the fight if you would like.

[Speaker 2]
You know what, that might be fine. To wait out the fight or to fight them?

[Speaker 4]
Well, that's between getting XP or not getting XP and staying alive.

[Speaker 7]
XP it is!

[Speaker 4]
XP.

[Speaker 1]
You get a small amount of XP for watching them fight.

[Speaker 2]
In character, he'd probably want to just watch them fight, and then if the skeletons lose, just defeat the stragglers. But unfortunately, the gamer has possessed him, so.

[Speaker 4]
The studio is also kind of a, he'd watch them, but, you know. If the party wants to fight, he'll fight with the party.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
It's hard- Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
It's hard balancing both what does your character want and what does the, you know, the crow in your brain want.

[Speaker 3]
That's why you just make a character that is the crow in your brain.

[Speaker 6]
Yes! That is why I made the crow in the brain.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this combat's huge. Tara, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to move up for movement. I'm going to spot a wolf. I'm going to stab the wolf.

With needles. For shits and giggles, I'm going with silver.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, that's you done?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
That horse should not get a fight.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to let you hit end turn, because every time I've done it, you've also hit it at the same time.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. My players never help me in my other game. I have to do everything.

I never let my players help me.

[Speaker 5]
I'm a control freak. No, she doesn't. I get so confused.

I go into a different game and they're like, do it yourself. And I'm like, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Holy shit. Maybe these skeletons don't need help. Die, wolf.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm back.

[Speaker 7]
Welcome back.

[Speaker 1]
My goodness, wolves. They're meant to be more threatening than this. Manza's horse.

No, he doesn't. He's going to take three attacks.

[Speaker 6]
Wolf's fucking dead.

[Speaker 1]
Marissa, it is your turn.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Okay, here we are. Okay.

I guess I'll throw the rest of my stuff in.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a bear of assholes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Champion.

[Speaker 7]
Hit, hit.

[Speaker 1]
Susudio, it is your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okie dokie. How many enemies are out here?

[Speaker 1]
There are several wolves.

[Speaker 4]
I need to get rid of my wounded condition. So that will be two action. You know what, we're going to...

I'm going to conserve. Use my reflective ripple stance. After that, I will...

I'll recall knowledge. And see what their weaknesses are, if possible.

[Speaker 1]
I'm back. Is this for the wolves or the skeletons?

[Speaker 4]
Oh wait, is the skeleton friendly?

[Speaker 1]
He is friendly.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Wolf then.

[Speaker 1]
They don't have any real weaknesses. They... work well in group attacks.

[Speaker 4]
That'll be my go.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basher.

[Speaker 2]
Hello. Oh. Move forward so I can see.

I'll move forward a bit further so I can see. Let's see. Giant wolf!

We shall... Actually not. How many hit movement do I have?

I have ten more. There we go. So that is one action.

Another action. Needle darts. Because it is a funny spell.

Ah, hit and a miss. Would we have one more hit point from the hour?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't give one out. I will give Mimosa and Dr. Basher hero points. Thank you.

And McCannon. I like the entity thing. It's weird as fuck.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, still a miss. Oh well. I shall end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
McCannon.

[Speaker 7]
With you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh dear. All right, it is your turn again.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to bring some light into the situation. Oh, hello. Let's see.

How far can I go? I can go... Oh, but that guy is there.

Oh, but Mimosa's there. Oh, I didn't mean to move. Let me see what I can do here.

Oh, I can do that. Excuse me, that is not what you were showing me.

[Speaker 1]
I assume you want to hit the two wolves.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like that.

[Speaker 1]
Snipe the skeleton.

[Speaker 3]
I forgot how long it was. It was like, oh no, is there a skeleton all the way at the end?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 3]
I can do two actions on that.

[Speaker 1]
Play, but take half. Let's see, you done?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. That's the one thing I really liked about the version 13, was having the markers. But I also know that monks has a markers module.

[Speaker 1]
I like markers.

[Speaker 3]
I'm too dumb to know which enemy is currently attacking. Oops. The markers help with that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Alright. He stands up.

He is going to hit the hot dog. He did it. This man's a monster, holy shit.

With his last action, he can go for Mimosa. Easy. Holy shit!

What a beast. That's you for 14 damage, Mimosa. Continue its assault on thee.

That one sucks. Champion's turn, he continues jousting. Mimosa, it is your turn.

You did get bit.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I did? Did I take the damage?

[Speaker 1]
I can apply it for you.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It's all good.

[Speaker 5]
14. No.

[Speaker 7]
What the heck?

[Speaker 1]
How do I do this? You've got one action left.

[Speaker 3]
Anki, please stop stepping on people.

[Speaker 1]
It's a studio. It is your turn. You do those two with Flurry of Blows.

[Speaker 4]
I'm using Flowing Wave. Does that... Can I use Flurry of Blows with that?

[Speaker 1]
I'm pretty sure you can. I think it replaces your unarmed Shrags. Yep.

Which Flurry just means you can do two of them for one action.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then yes. So that would be... Well, it wouldn't matter because I moved...

I activated my Ripple Stance and then I hit.

[Speaker 1]
You activated your Ripple Stance last time.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I did? Okay, that's true.

[Speaker 1]
You'd have one more action.

[Speaker 4]
I'm tired.

[Speaker 1]
That's okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so I use Flurry of Blows. Does that work? Would I have...

So if I did that, would I have two more actions?

[Speaker 1]
You'd have... You have one more attack. You can Flurry once, but...

It has the Flurrish trait.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, well I missed.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 2]
It is alive. This guy is almost dead. Three cheers.

[Speaker 4]
I get all arts again. Wait, did I have the wolf?

[Speaker 2]
It's all damaged.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, you kill it.

[Speaker 2]
Splendid. Are there any other wolves that I simply cannot see? Yes, there are.

They're just outside the light, it's not that I can't see them. Let's throw a stick at it. If I could find...

Ah, here we go. Cast... Give me a second.

Boop. Cast... Attack penalty...

Oosh, and I miss. That will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Mikanin. There are wolves in the dark that you cannot see. Oh no, you can see this one.

[Speaker 7]
Very nice.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no I see.

[Speaker 1]
Very nice, you kill it. Pera. It is your turn.

There are two wolves left.

[Speaker 3]
I'll help that guy out. I'll need the perks.

[Speaker 2]
Needle Dirt is such a fun spell.

[Speaker 3]
Woo!

[Speaker 1]
So I double that, don't I?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. It's dead.

[Speaker 3]
Huzzah. Alright. I guess I technically have an action left.

If you can throw a rock at this fella. I can't throw a rock, that would assume that I have really strong arms.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that'll be me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I hit end turn. Oh well.

[Speaker 1]
It's what it does, sending a text. Ah, champion. You will.

[Speaker 6]
What was that?

[Speaker 3]
Oh. How did the food get down there? He fell off my desk.

And he wasn't moving, I was really worried. Until I looked down and saw he was eating food. Funny, who's over here?

[Speaker 1]
Oops, he was jousting. Ah, same attack bonus. Marissa, it is your turn.

One wolf left.

[Speaker 5]
That's so stupid. I have spells, and they're my average card power. Water, Med, and Power.

I guess it's coming from the guy who has the power.

[Speaker 7]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
The wolf dies. The leader on the horse turns to you and says, Excellent work, recruits. It is time that you are liberated from your flesh.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you know what? I think we saw a few more wolves down over that way. So we're gonna go take care of those for you first.

[Speaker 1]
Roll deception.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, okay. Oh, that's gonna be diplomacy, right?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry? Deception.

[Speaker 5]
Oh wait, no, deception is actually a thing, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm, no. Leave that to us. You man the fort here.

Come on, men. Charge!

[Speaker 5]
Good luck, soldiers.

[Speaker 1]
They go past you and look for the wolves. No! They're gonna get bored and kill themselves later, so I'm gonna just end the encounter.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, um... I love how their solution to each other is fight amongst themselves, and, um, well, die.

[Speaker 1]
Mechanon's level 2. Sissudia's level 2. The rest are not.

Sorry. That becomes 288.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, congratulations, Tara.

[Speaker 7]
1001.

[Speaker 2]
You just squeaked by. Huzzah. Huzzah!

[Speaker 6]
Excellent job convincing the skeletons of otherwise. Wow, there are a lot of bones here.

[Speaker 1]
There's a lot. There was a lot of fighting in this area.

[Speaker 2]
Imagine, if you will, a child in a candy store. This is what the doctor feels like right now.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, just thinking that.

[Speaker 1]
There's a lot more wolf corpses about as well.

[Speaker 6]
Yes! That is excellent news.

[Speaker 2]
I'll mark it down somewhere, but there's nothing to pinch exactly from the wolves.

[Speaker 6]
There are also wolf skeletons as well. Ah!

[Speaker 2]
Blundered.

[Speaker 1]
They didn't survive the four hours that you spent resting, did I? I can show you what they look like.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Here it is. Put it in Perra's light.

[Speaker 2]
Let me move out of black and white so I can see it as well.

[Speaker 6]
Fun. La creature. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to see if there's any secret secrets in here before the skeletons come back and realise Mimosa's ruse. What would I roll to look around to see if there's anything of particular note?

[Speaker 6]
Perception. It's always perception. If you're doing something like that, it's perception.

Okay, secret check? Yes, please. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
You don't find anything of note in here beyond, like, skeleton armour and stuff that is banged up beyond use. You hear bickering coming from the north- the north-east.

[Speaker 6]
North-east. Adventure awaits. Oh.

Have you yourself seen anything there, Mimosa?

[Speaker 5]
Um, I saw nothing up this way. Did I see anything up this way?

[Speaker 6]
I hear bickering. I see some stairs leading down. Oh, just some- just some stairs, but that's about it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, on this side- The tingle in your bones is a bit stronger. Banging.

[Speaker 6]
This way.

[Speaker 1]
Banging this- in this room.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
It does look like if you go down these stairs, you can go either left or right.

[Speaker 2]
When you say north-east, do you mean the path on this side?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that's where the bickering was coming from. You can also hear it from down here now, too.

[Speaker 2]
And from here. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
So, they lead more or less to the same place.

[Speaker 7]
Correct.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. I'll ask if any of the more perceptive members can find anything of note since we feel our bones moving. Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
You've checked all the bones, there's nothing worth looking for here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was imagining, like, our bones under our skin, like, wiggling.

[Speaker 7]
That kind of feels like they are, being here.

[Speaker 6]
That is dreadfully unpleasant.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, like- Hold on. Would that be, like, a perception? Just to go over there and look?

[Speaker 6]
That's not- Yeah, you can go down the stairs and look if you'd like.

[Speaker 1]
The tingling gets stronger as you head down this hallway. Your bone tingle. The bone tingle has been present throughout the entire cave, but it is stronger here.

[Speaker 4]
Um, you know that, uh, tingling that- I've been feeling a tingling in my bones.

[Speaker 6]
Not sure if you have, but it's worse down there. Let's hope it doesn't do anything to our skeletal structure.

[Speaker 2]
I quite like where my skin is, but it does mean where we need to go is in that direction, I'm afraid. So, off we go. If it gets too bad, we can turn back.

[Speaker 6]
I imagine being turned into a skeleton... Less than- Less than pleasant. But, I do appreciate the information.

I'll keep note. Oh, you're right, it is mighty unpleasant. Whoa.

I don't think it's supposed to feel like that, Mimosa.

[Speaker 5]
Um, we've lost the cannon again.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, Vae. Rob the tree. We're at a level.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. Ooh, harrowing managers.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna move the cannon to the light.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Do you photosynthesize my cannon?

[Speaker 7]
I don't know where you're getting this idea.

[Speaker 2]
With the tree inside you and all.

[Speaker 7]
Metaphor.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. And just like, tisks. Can we hear the skeleton arguing happening?

What is it about?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so two things. The tingle gets stronger as you move towards this magically locked door. The bickering is coming from over here, where these skeletons are.

It is just one skeleton yapping orders at the other ones. What is that over there? Recruits, how goes your search for materials for the siege engine?

[Speaker 5]
We're still looking for some, sir.

[Speaker 1]
Good, we plan to have this wall cracked by the end of the day.

[Speaker 2]
Should we ask them to perhaps remind us? This is whispering, it'll be like, should we ask them to remind us?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, what exactly are we looking for specifically?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, there are pieces scattered around the dungeon for the machine we're building. Uh, if you have located any of them, make sure you send these idiots to go pick them up.

[Speaker 2]
That's a small salute. Do you mind just reminding us why we have to break through the wall? I'm afraid I might have jostled something.

[Speaker 1]
It's our grand purpose, can you not feel it? The beckoning? Whatever is behind that wall is the purpose for life.

[Speaker 6]
Well, of a skeleton at least.

[Speaker 4]
The studio's gonna whisper, I have an idea, but let's talk about it somewhere else.

[Speaker 5]
Right. Well, we'll keep at it.

[Speaker 6]
Excellent work, cadets.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, out of earshot of these guys, I'm gonna suggest that we point, we get these, all these skeletons to surround one of the barrels and say it's in the barrel, and then we shoot the barrel and explode them all.

[Speaker 7]
You can just get them to hit it, like try to pry it open.

[Speaker 6]
What did you say, Otto? Do we wanna kill them? I would rather not, but it, this whole bone thing is a bit concerning.

We could alternatively lead them to where we led the other skeletons. They, true, I do like the barrel idea, but we could, uh, perhaps we should investigate the locked door.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, also if they're killing each other because they're bored.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, again, would much rather they wouldn't do that, but I suppose it works out for the best. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Hard to study undead if they keep dying. You could study me. Oh, really?

I would love to contribute to that. Oh, you made a mistake.

[Speaker 5]
No, that was a mistake.

[Speaker 2]
That is fantastic news. Is your skin still poisonous by any chance?

[Speaker 5]
No, it is not. Awesome.

[Speaker 6]
Just puts out a hand to shake. The army that's right here, right? Is that where they are?

Yeah. Working on this machine. She'll say, hey, skeleton.

What do you require, cadet? There is a huge part at the south side of the cavern. We need you to retrieve it.

[Speaker 1]
You heard her, men. Go get it! They all just drop their tools and form up and start moving to wherever you direct them.

[Speaker 6]
I love it. Pretty much the same place she directed the other skeletons. Which skeletons?

The one who wanted to de-glove us.

[Speaker 1]
These ones return without anything. Eventually.

[Speaker 5]
Will they come back already? Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Do you hang around until they come back?

[Speaker 5]
If they come back. I think we're using their absence as a way to get into the door. Right?

Or what are we doing?

[Speaker 2]
We're trying to see what's up with the machine and what's up with the door. But right now is the door, since the machine will probably be done faster than we can figure out what's up with it.

[Speaker 6]
So, door. It's magically locked. Yes.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
How do you unlock it? That's what I'm trying to figure out how to do.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to ask the... ...to level 3. I learned the rank or the level of the most powerful magical effect the spell detects is determined by the gem.

[Speaker 6]
It's like a heightened magic lock on the door.

[Speaker 1]
It's like, I don't know, 5th rank or something.

[Speaker 2]
Breaking it open it is.

[Speaker 6]
Can you break open a lock that's magically sealed? Well, a lock is only as good as the strength of the door. But it's a magical lock.

That's true. I'll cautiously ask the other skeleton. Have you figured out what's behind this door?

We have not, Cadet. Do you know how to open it?

[Speaker 1]
That's what the machine's for.

[Speaker 3]
We could actually just look for the parts. That's true. That's true.

I hope this doesn't...

[Speaker 2]
That's true. Alright, off we go looking, I suppose. Can I check the machine to see if there's anything we can glean from it?

Besides being a huge digging thing?

[Speaker 1]
It's pretty much just like a siege engine, like a battering ram.

[Speaker 2]
Well, alright then.

[Speaker 1]
They've got some of that oil in it. It looks like they're going to put it up against the door and blow a hole through.

[Speaker 2]
I see. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Eventually the goon skeletons get back. And this guy says, You idiots! Where's the peace?

And he just beats this guy to death. Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, let's go? Let's go. Time to go.

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
There's a path this way, towards the right. Oh, we're going down. Alright, fair enough.

[Speaker 4]
What's the door made of?

[Speaker 5]
I think I missed that.

[Speaker 1]
Magic stone.

[Speaker 5]
IE, we can't break through it. We cannot get through it unless we follow Landy's puzzle.

[Speaker 1]
Have a hero point, Nessie. Very clever.

[Speaker 5]
Yay!

[Speaker 1]
Otter, you can have a hero point too.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so there's a path to the right, and there's another path to the right. There are two branching paths to the right, as far as I can see. So we can try walking past, because they don't seem to be...

Oh, I fell into a wall, I think.

[Speaker 6]
It's a drop down. You can climb down, it just takes a bit of time. Okay.

I'm gonna lose my cannon again.

[Speaker 1]
Studio, from the north there, you hear the sound of flowing water.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Ooh, water. Down here.

He gets very excited about this.

[Speaker 1]
You see, this is a bigger drop, it's about 30 or 40 feet down, and there's a little waterfall over the other side.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, delightful. I'm gonna climb down. I think I have something when it comes to climbing, because of...

Yeah, natural climber. Okay, I get a circumstance bonus to athletic checks to climb.

[Speaker 1]
So if you look at your sheet, at the speeds section, there's a bit that has a, like, land, 25, and then there's climbing that has a dice roll. If you click that, it will do the check for your climbing, and it should have your... Beautiful.

You have no trouble moving down.

[Speaker 6]
Do I see anything?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it is 40 feet, but you only need to roll once. If you crit fail, you're gonna fall.

[Speaker 3]
No, I was looking at my cat fall.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to tie a rope to something, so if I do fall, it would be less painful.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, I have a climbing kit. Oh, there we go. Is it still the same roll?

For the climbing kit, you would just need to do the flat check to get down safely. Probably. That was a success.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's a fail. DC 15.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, this says the flat check is when you critically fall. Critically fail to prevent a fall.

[Speaker 1]
That would be enough of a safeguard to circumvent the challenge.

[Speaker 6]
Oh man, brains?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, my keyboard's gone flat.

[Speaker 6]
I'm swapping it out for the other. I think that's good. Nonetheless, you're able to climb down, fine.

Power is fine. Make like a tree and leaf, mechanic. Leaf now.

I'm sorry. So now the problem is, you have to climb up the other side. Yeah.

Beautiful. My favorite spell. Could you just make a bridge with that?

You just about could.

[Speaker 5]
Can you make a bridge? I thought it was just stairs. Horizontal stairs.

[Speaker 1]
I love that. Horizontal ladder.

[Speaker 5]
When you'll be playing like a hopscotch, sorta, which feels dangerous, but hey.

[Speaker 1]
I assume it's just a normal ladder. Oh yeah, you can make the ladder.

[Speaker 3]
You can make a ladder or a staircase.

[Speaker 1]
Or a staircase, if you'd prefer. Where would you like to go? To the side with the waterfall?

There is a, you can see there is another cave leading out of this room up here.

[Speaker 6]
Where are people wanting to go? Who's taking lead? Is there anything behind the waterfall?

[Speaker 1]
Do you enter the water? The water is flowing quite quickly.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, uh, nevermind then. No, no, bye studio! Nevermind then.

[Speaker 1]
The water leads into like a hole that it fills completely.

[Speaker 6]
Do I have good swimming because I'm a frog? Am I amphibious? I think you are amphibious as a Tripki.

Oh, okay. Doesn't tell me shit about Tripki. There we go.

I don't think you are. Oh, they're tree folk! I guess that makes sense.

Well, he wasn't a tree folk, he was born in a crypt. He was born in a mall. Yep.

Yep, there's a specific Tripki that's, um...

[Speaker 4]
Which Tripki is it?

[Speaker 6]
Um, it is...

[Speaker 4]
Because I guess that's Heritage.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's the Riverside ones. Which you chose, Dampier. Yeah.

The Dampiers. Who the hell is Dampiers? Okay, um, are we scaling the cliff or are we...

I mean, I can make a ladder or a staircase. Can you move the ladder? No.

I thought you said it before. Because it's locked in place, so I would assume not to. Alright, climbing it is.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, which side do we want to be on?

[Speaker 5]
I mean, unless you want to use another spell.

[Speaker 6]
I only have the one for the helpful steps. Oh, okay, never mind then. I do not get to be spontaneous.

I am prepared. I will say it's this one.

[Speaker 3]
No one's making a decision, I'm making it now.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes. Let me roll my climb then.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, or have you conducted this spell? Do you have to roll climb if I have done a ladder?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, well, all is well then. No. Much appreciated.

Is this a wall or a set of stairs? Stairs. Blended.

There we go. My cannon, once again, is left behind. Left in the dark.

Alright, so this way, down here? You're already kind of down here. Okay.

More choices.

[Speaker 1]
You get the same bone tingle getting to the backside of the room, the skeletons are sieging.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, this is the other side of the... I see. Is this the same door?

[Speaker 1]
It's not the same door, but it's practically identical to the other side.

[Speaker 5]
Is it practically identical? Is it magical? Yes.

Okay, cool.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Let me roll some secret perception checks, though.

[Speaker 6]
From us? Oh. I think that's the wrong one.

Dr. Basha... Oh, wait, that's GM only. Oh my god.

Yeah, I cannot see anything.

[Speaker 1]
Para, my cannon... Dr. Basha, you notice there is a treasure chest in the water that is flowing down through the river?

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Alright. Uh...

Let's see if we can fish it out with some... Some way or the other. I'm sorry, what are we looking at?

There is a treasure chest. Oh. Oh, so there is.

I don't know why I didn't see that. It's a little hard to see with all the, you know, water and all that.

[Speaker 2]
We should probably try to fish it out. Does anyone have anything?

[Speaker 6]
Para's going to inspect the water. Oh, of course.

[Speaker 1]
With the secret check I did for you before, I will tell you everything. She got really high roll. The danger of this is the flowing water.

The water itself is quite safe, but if you get dragged down, you could possibly die if you went all the way down the waterfall and into the hole.

[Speaker 6]
So, anybody good at tying ropes? I mean, I would assume I am. I would assume she is.

It would... We could tie a rope around someone and throw them in. The studio volunteers for whatever.

[Speaker 4]
If somebody has a rope.

[Speaker 6]
The studio has volunteers as well.

[Speaker 2]
I do have that rope for when I climb down, so you can borrow mine. I also have rope.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you're volunteering me to go into the water?

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no, no, no. To tie the rope around the studio. The studio volunteers.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that would be a bit presumptuous of me. Yeah, sure, I'll tie the rope. Is this supposed to end in crafting, or can I just say I tied the rope?

[Speaker 1]
I believe thievery does tying rope.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, could survival work as well?

[Speaker 6]
I'm doing thievery. Oh, wow. Yeah, that makes sense.

Thievery is good. Perfect score.

[Speaker 4]
Good job. Do I have to actually act out the whole swimming thing, or can we just say I did it?

[Speaker 1]
The same way there's the climbing checks on your sheet, there's also swimming. I need you to do some of those.

[Speaker 4]
I will be here appointing that.

[Speaker 2]
Can you breathe underwater? Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, alright.

[Speaker 4]
I'm a dampier, I don't have to breathe. I don't think so, right?

[Speaker 6]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
It'd be pretty funny if you just lost the studio. He's not dead, he's just gone. You're unable to progress with how the water's moving, so you just need to keep trying until you either roll really badly or you get there.

That's a success, you move... How far do you move with that? Swim...

[Speaker 6]
to a maximum distance of ten feet. So you would need to succeed on three more checks to swim down and get it, because it's a little bit underwater. Okay, so do another check?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, please. Yes. Nothing happens, roll again.

You get ten closer, you just need to roll one more to swim down and grab it now. That is a success, you are at the chest. Now you need to do three more to bring it back.

It will be harder dragging it back.

[Speaker 4]
Did they just pull me?

[Speaker 6]
Or you can loot it, if you would like. Oh. Oh, um...

[Speaker 1]
You would have to hold your breath for... Let's see, so there's one, two, three... Right.

You can just grab everything then. I'm just gonna drag it out, and you can share it with the party. Yay!

You can pull Susudia back to avoid the checks.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, awesome. What? Done.

A burger? A cheese elixir, I don't know if I like that.

[Speaker 6]
That's alright. Cheese elixir... Bubblegum?

Lesser.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, don't we have a friend, a companion that's a rat?

[Speaker 6]
Can we save a cheese elixir for them? Oh, yes. Please?

Yes, yes, we can save it for Ver. Yay! Um...

Man, it's too bad Rose is in here, she'd eat that burger. Oh, this is fine. Yeah, I know, that's why I said it'd have to be Rose.

She's the only one who wouldn't care how bad it is.

[Speaker 1]
It's like those McDonald's burgers where they do the studies of leaving it for years.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah. I kinda want that Raymond. I definitely think Mosa needs the bubblegum.

Oh, that's fun. It's like a mini spell, that's delightful.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, the food and drinks in Pathfinder are really fun.

[Speaker 6]
Except for Burger.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Burger is for Rose. You know what, it's fun because it's basic. There was...

Everything else. Almost all through Season of Ghosts we ate omelettes for breakfast and it gave us huge bonuses. Does anyone want the Raymond rune?

[Speaker 3]
I do want the Raymond. I was waiting to see if anyone else wanted it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Otter claimed Raymond first. Yeah, go ahead. There is no armor I need disguising, so please feel free.

[Speaker 7]
Who says I need it for disguising right now?

[Speaker 6]
Cassorite. Taster's Folly is an interesting poison. Lucidio, are you still interested in poisons?

You might find the Taster's Folly to your liking then. Okay, absolutely. Um...

If nobody wants the Cassorite, I guess I'll take it. Can I rock, paper, scissors you for it? Sure.

Cool. Day 20 roll, let's see if I get a 1 again. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god, Hot.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god!

[Speaker 2]
The improbability, yes, you can have the Cassorite. That's crazy.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basha needs to stop putting things to d20 rolls.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, maybe next time it should be a d6.

[Speaker 4]
Christ. Did Mimosa even roll? Yeah, Mimosa got a 2.

I got a 2. I got a 1.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was about to say that I'm probably the best when she wants to roll again, because I roll like shit. And I technically did.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
That is the funniest. Does anyone want the burger?

[Speaker 7]
You guys keep out of the burger.

[Speaker 2]
It's damp and icky. But we need to give the cheese licks a traverse, so that will just go into the party stash to be delivered later. That is so funny.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not even mad, that's just incredible, honestly. The chances! Oh man, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Just for posterity's sake, for another item that we want to go between, we should do it again, just to see if I get a 1 later.

[Speaker 6]
Is there a path down here?

[Speaker 2]
Is this a dead end? Oh, it's a path.

[Speaker 6]
Of course it is.

[Speaker 5]
This is a true dungeon level.

[Speaker 6]
The labyrinth. Oh wait, I didn't turn on the music for this, let me hear what's going on. Oh!

A barrel! A barrel? Yes.

Right here. I think we are coming back around to the patrol. Oh, fascinating.

[Speaker 4]
There's a dead end over here, is there anything at this dead end, or is it just a dead end?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'm going too far. Is it just a dead end? Right here?

No, it's empty. Yes, I think I recognize this hall at the head. This is where I got trapped.

[Speaker 5]
This one down here?

[Speaker 1]
The only thing of note left in the labyrinth is the barrels.

[Speaker 5]
Cool.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so we do have to find the pieces to the...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, which I think is... Oh, there's a door up ahead.

[Speaker 6]
Or this door up ahead. There's a door. Is it a magic door, or is it a normal door?

This one's a regular door.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, joy! I'm gonna open it unless somebody stops me. I'm going to stand back.

[Speaker 1]
As you open the door, a skeleton turns to you and says, You may not have our part of the machine! Die!

[Speaker 4]
We don't want to have it, we want you to take it to where it can be useful. No, too late.

[Speaker 2]
I think they want to bite us.

[Speaker 4]
I can't use stealth for this. Perception.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, my head. I've had a headache all day. I'm sorry.

Are you dehydrated? No, I drank plenty of water. I could probably drink more, though.

[Speaker 2]
It could just be a minor cold that's decided to inflict itself upon you.

[Speaker 4]
It's probably...

[Speaker 1]
Video.

[Speaker 4]
Medicine.

[Speaker 1]
You're first.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so that was one.

[Speaker 3]
And... Two. Three.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, for fuck's sake. Alright. That's my go.

[Speaker 1]
Not gonna flurry of blows?

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I can, because I moved as an action, I activated my stance, and then... Oh, I guess I could flurry of blows.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to stop reminding you after this.

[Speaker 4]
That's totally fair.

[Speaker 1]
You pretty much want to be doing it every turn.

[Speaker 4]
Critical miss anyway. Rip.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this guy is going to step over and sack you. He misses twice, though. What does a cone look like?

I need a well-safe- Oh, I should have targeted people. Hang on. There we go.

Beautiful. As it screams at you.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, wait, it's screaming? Is this a gamma reaction?

[Speaker 1]
I think you need to have eaten it already.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no! Damn.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, jeez.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to reroll. I've got my healer. I've got healer.

Who needs it? Well, fuck. Fine.

Whatever.

[Speaker 1]
I just need a saving throw from Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 5]
Wow. Wow, even Pyrrha didn't? What the hell?

[Speaker 1]
There's no way this could- It's unlikely that I kill you all with this. Or maybe I do.

[Speaker 4]
What was the DC? It was pretty high.

[Speaker 1]
It was 26.

[Speaker 4]
Good lord.

[Speaker 1]
For everyone to roll so bad.

[Speaker 4]
What do you mean, so bad?

[Speaker 5]
I crit-failed. So I take double- We rolled good. You just- High DC.

[Speaker 1]
What is the DC? I'm sorry. Is this double damage?

[Speaker 5]
If crit-fail, is that double- Yeah, if you crit-failed, it's double damage. Alright, I'm down.

[Speaker 1]
Oh wow, the DC. That's fair. Mimosa doesn't crit-fail.

Dr. Basha still does.

[Speaker 2]
Ow. Well, I'm down.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa just needs to take 20.

[Speaker 3]
Why did I take less damage? Yes! Oh my god.

I live.

[Speaker 6]
Barely.

[Speaker 1]
Failures are a frightened one. Dr. Basha is frightened too.

[Speaker 4]
Frightened one. Okay, I can put that on myself somewhere.

[Speaker 1]
I can drag it out. And it is done.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for robbing that one guy, Clank. That's the item that stopped me from going back.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's awesome! You're welcome. A bird's gonna do what a bird's gonna do.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I had an idea for an action, but I'd kill Susudio.

[Speaker 7]
I'd like to see that.

[Speaker 3]
Because I wanted to do heal, and you would get harmed by heal.

[Speaker 4]
Can you just heal away from me?

[Speaker 3]
I cannot, because I was gonna three-action heal so I could heal as many people as possible. Does it hit Susudio? I believe it would.

[Speaker 1]
It does, yeah. I reckon it just hits Susudio.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, will it kill me, kill me, kill me?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, because I'd have to roll healing to do it.

[Speaker 5]
The problem is, is you're already down so far that any would be bad if you get hit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, especially because it's going to be a third-rank heal because it's from my font.

[Speaker 5]
And we also don't have anything to heal you back.

[Speaker 3]
I do have a harm spell now, but Susudio would be down. And how many would that be? 1d8 by 2d8?

So it'd be 3d8 that I'd be risking. That wouldn't kill you outright. Anyway, I'm gonna cast Holy Light on this guy with the wings.

I'm gonna hero point that. How dare you.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus Christ. Fucked him up.

[Speaker 3]
And that is actually one of two actions, so I'm going to shield myself.

[Speaker 1]
Now I'm going to end- no, you gotta take it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm so sorry, it's so much habit.

[Speaker 1]
It's all good, I... Melissa, what would you like to do? You just nearly had your eardrums burst.

[Speaker 5]
Um, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basha did have the eardrums burst.

[Speaker 5]
I guess I will take an action to pop in a gum.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Just in case.

[Speaker 1]
A Paras Frightened condition would have gone down.

[Speaker 5]
Unless it's you?

[Speaker 1]
At the end of your turn, you'll swap.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, at the end of my turn, okay. Um, and go... I guess I'll use the rest of my turn to take an Elixir of Life.

Lovely. Fantastic.

[Speaker 1]
Have a hero point for that.

[Speaker 5]
I wish I could roll above a 1 anytime I feel.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basha, you can also have a hero point for not dying.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks. Nice. That's appreciated.

So, Frightened naturally goes down 1 every round. Is there a way to make yourself less frightened with an action?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, there are some feats that do that. But if you have no spells, then you're out of luck.

[Speaker 2]
I will heal myself a bit, because my spells have been damaged.

[Speaker 5]
Bedge, lay down.

[Speaker 2]
Use versatile vial. I'll use two actions to check. Two.

[Speaker 5]
Rosie pooped, that's why she's not sleeping. Yeah, we don't like sleeping with you. Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, don't worry.

[Speaker 2]
Again, have to make them to use them. So, let's see.

[Speaker 6]
One. Two. Apply healing.

[Speaker 2]
And then with my last... Apply healing. Very cool.

And then with the last action, I'll put up a shield.

[Speaker 6]
Very good. And that will be my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, McCannon. It is your turn. Very good, you doing anything else?

Miss.

[Speaker 4]
Who's off guard to Susudio?

[Speaker 7]
This fella.

[Speaker 4]
This guy? Okay. Flarea blows.

[Speaker 1]
That's not quite your turn yet, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, sorry. Brain. How long are we going to be in the game for?

I'm very quickly fading.

[Speaker 1]
It's up to everyone. We can stop whenever, really. You're probably about halfway done with the dungeon, but you've done the biggest fights, so maybe two-thirds done.

It's Susudio's turn now.

[Speaker 7]
Perfect.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so Flarea blows.

[Speaker 1]
So he'll be off guard for the first one, so you'll just have to let me remove it for the second attack.

[Speaker 4]
Did I roll off guard there?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, that was good.

[Speaker 4]
And then I'll do one more attack, and then dart away. Ooh, wow. That almost never works.

Oh, shit.

[Speaker 1]
It's not very often you see a natural 20v8 hit.

[Speaker 4]
He was off guard. Alright, whatever.

[Speaker 1]
They haven't set their glaive, so they can't attack you. That's a cool ability. Yeah, they'll let you get away.

It's this fellow's turn. Can he not?

[Speaker 4]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Now I have dictated before that in times of uncertainty of who to attack, I would be prioritizing AI art, so Susudio's going to get it. Here's one more attack. They hit again.

Takes you down. Does his claw pep reach? Throw in 10 foot.

He strides here and tosses his claw bit Mimosa. Misses. He's going to move through his ally out to here.

Skuttleson can move to here and attack the doctor. Misses. Misses.

Parry.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I am going to heal Susudio. With my only heal that applies to Susudio.

With two actions. Oh, wait, hang on. I have to do harm versus undead.

[Speaker 1]
Not very often you do that one. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, thank you. That takes him all the way up.

[Speaker 3]
I am also going to then shield meself. Huzzah. And that is me, and I will not click the button.

I will take my hand off my mouse and pet my cat.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, it's your turn. Skeleton in front of you is looking awfully hurt. Another happy skeleton.

[Speaker 3]
I know I took this art once so that I could make a regular skeleton. Because I didn't like the look of any of the regular skeletons.

[Speaker 1]
Did you just like cut off his wing?

[Speaker 3]
Pretty much, yeah. I just needed a naked skeleton and they're all wearing armor.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, like these boys are.

[Speaker 3]
I think I also dulled its teeth. But I don't think I did anything to the claws.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It's okay. The happy skeleton is very hurt. The other guy is not so much.

But they aren't very tough. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 3]
You were well and caught today.

[Speaker 1]
They are destroyed.

[Speaker 3]
Where's all this luck in my games, Nessie?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not doubting you, but how did you sneak attack?

[Speaker 5]
I know, I noticed that. I accidentally left it off from last time.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, that's okay.

[Speaker 5]
You can get rid of that.

[Speaker 1]
He still dies. He still dies.

[Speaker 5]
I noticed that too. I guess I'll just... It's because I used Twin Fane.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, gotcha. Yeah, you roll 8 on your 4d8 and then it gets doubled with your mod. Yeah, it's enough to kill him still.

[Speaker 7]
Hot dog! Jesus Christ. Nice.

[Speaker 5]
Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Killed him on the number. Well done. I have a hero point.

That was a great turn. Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 6]
It is my turn. Oh. There is...

several creatures that need dealing with.

[Speaker 7]
Several fewer, though.

[Speaker 2]
And there's this guy in the corner.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you're seeing.

[Speaker 2]
We are going to do it from Kimruth. Do that. And then see if we can...

get the edge case.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, joy, it does.

[Speaker 5]
Again?!

[Speaker 2]
You have got to be kidding me. Well, that is what I roll.

[Speaker 1]
So they both make the reflux. Fails. Seeds.

That is bludgeoning.

[Speaker 2]
And then I will cast shield again because... not much I can do on that case. Alright, and I end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
A cannon. There are two skeletons left. That's rough, buddy.

The cannon still has an action. Is there anything else you'd like to do? This guy, he...

can move into here. That's a good idea. Hmm.

He's going to attack Sisudio. Hitting me twice. It is now your turn, Sisudio.

You can stand over that guy. I'll move him out of the way.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, actually, I'm not going to move there because... I have to get up because I'm prone. So I will move here.

[Speaker 7]
There.

[Speaker 4]
And end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
This fellow is going to go for my cannon. My cannon is too slick, though. He ain't doing shit to you.

[Speaker 6]
Pow!

[Speaker 1]
Now if you do the three action heal, Sisudio can still go down.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but I used my healing on him already. Now I wouldn't be able to bring him back up. Well, I guess I will...

[Speaker 4]
If I would have used two actions to get out of the way, would you be able to?

[Speaker 3]
You would have had to have gone, like, over here. Because, like, then you would have been protected by the wall. This wall?

No, I think I'd still hit that.

[Speaker 1]
You would need to be, like, here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Because it's an emanation.

[Speaker 1]
If you would have liked to go there, though, you would have been able to.

[Speaker 3]
Could I do that?

[Speaker 1]
It's done.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
That's one more action heal.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so... They both get to make the save. They both fail.

I think you've corked them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god. And then everyone who can take that healing can take that healing.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. I'm only, like, one off. This is excellent.

Thank you, Para. Three cheers.

[Speaker 3]
I can take my own healing. Can I take my own healing? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You're on the... You're on it.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, and then I can also choose another willing living creature within my range of my heal to heal equal to the spell's rank. So, Dr. Boshu, if you'd like to take that level 8... Er, no, level 3.

Sorry. Whoa. I don't know why I said 8.

You can take 3 more healing. Much appreciated.

[Speaker 1]
I've been going for about 4 hours, so I think we'll wrap it up here. You find the first piece of the siege engine. You can either...

The five of you can struggle to carry it back, or you can get the skeletons to move it for you. The goons, they are pretty adept at doing that.

[Speaker 3]
That's what they're here for. Yeah. And I feel bad for getting that one guy killed.

[Speaker 4]
He was already dead.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but he didn't have to get dead again.

[Speaker 4]
Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
It's alright. Might be able to summon him again. How many pieces of the siege engine are we missing?

[Speaker 1]
You need three more. When would people like to pick this up again? Because I am free.

Except for tomorrow afternoon, like, every day.

[Speaker 2]
So my next availability... I'm mostly free this week.

[Speaker 1]
Otherwise, if we don't want to think about it, we can just do next week at the same time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, sure. Why not? No, next week I'm free.

Yeah. Um...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm not free on Monday or Tuesday, but the rest of the week I'm free.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, what is Tuesday for you? Oh! Right.

Let me put in the time. Because I was gonna just post out my available times for the next week.

[Speaker 1]
You should post all of your available times in session times, and then not ever ask about playing in a game, ever.

[Speaker 7]
Very appropriate.

[Speaker 1]
Birthday's exciting, though.

[Speaker 2]
It's easier for me to say when I'm not available than when I am, so I'll just do that.

[Speaker 1]
It's currently, it's nearly 4pm here. Wait, I could keep running.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's 7 in the morning.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I was asking because I was like... It's 11 at night. Depending on the amount of time, I was like, alright, if it was...

Depending on the time over there, I was gonna be like, alright, just run later in the afternoon, and that'll be tomorrow morning for the marathon.

[Speaker 5]
But I have work.

[Speaker 1]
Just quit your job and play Pathfinder.

[Speaker 3]
So what's really stupid is I have like one hour session in the morning, and then like nothing for four hours after that.

[Speaker 1]
Well, we've got the mobile module installed now, so...

[Speaker 3]
And nobody don't have my mobile headphones. Actually, I could just take my regular headphones because I did get an attachment thing. I could.

I technically could.

[Speaker 1]
Get like a Bluetooth headset and you can play while doing massages.

[Speaker 3]
There is probably someone out there who would totally love that. Because there's people who like to listen to people talking, but not actually like talk to them.

[Speaker 1]
Like a background noise sort of thing. I'm gonna lock you all in this room so no one can explore the dungeon well.

[Speaker 3]
Hey guys.

[Speaker 1]
So it's in a leshy dungeon that I opened the game once, and all of the doors have been opened. And I was like, hmm. It's a bit sus.

But I wasn't sure who could have done it because none of the tokens had vision of the entire dungeon.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, what happened?

[Speaker 3]
That's because when you're doing GM, you only see the vision of what you have explored as that character. I found out. So like if I was logged in as someone else, I wouldn't see what they saw as a GM.

If that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
Suspicious. Do I want to get up at 5am to run Skeleton Cave?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If it's what makes the people happy, I'll do it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna post my Friday time too. No, I can't do that.

[Speaker 1]
I love getting rare tags for making two-part dungeons. It's so easy. Yes, it's waste 15 minutes looking at a bug or item.

Thank you for the free rare tag. Palutene Detective looks good. There's not many class-restricted archetypes.

[Speaker 3]
I think they started adding those recently. Because I know the one I was mentioning to Xanath was a class-restricted one. I think the class-restricted ones are really cool.

I haven't read enough about them to really know if they're actually good. I've heard that the cleric one sucks, but it also sounds cool. So, who cares?

[Speaker 1]
I don't want to take the spellshot one on Jesse when I make him for Gunslinger. He's also a bard, so I guess I could take Bard Dedication. I don't know.

Too many decisions.

[Speaker 3]
I know I was trying to find one for Klofi, and I was thinking of Gunslinger. For the reloading. But I didn't like any of the Dedication reloading.

[Speaker 1]
I think I might put myself on Dedications for the Living Vessel, because I think it only has a few. You can just retrain it. Yeah, I should do that.

Then you get your rare tag refunded.

[Speaker 3]
If Living Vessel doesn't have one that you could take, I think you're allowed to take another Dedication.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, what is this for?

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it says you can't take another one until you've gained two other feats, but if you can't take another feat, oh, you can.

[Speaker 1]
That's not with Priokhtype in mind as well. That is a rule I would consider ignoring, but people get really annoying about it, so it makes me then be like, no. Yeah, I'm not going to be like, I'm not going to undo it just because I have a...

Oh, wait, wait. Using their normal class feats. Okay.

Like if someone was like, I want to take the Sentinel Dedication and Exemplar Dedication and then like, Wresla. I'd be like, you're getting banned, kid.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, no, that would be totally reasonable.

[Speaker 1]
But there's one I think it's like Familiar Master where all of the feats are bad at level 4 and 6, and it's like, oh, that kind of sucks.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
For bad Dedications, I sort of had to just be like, okay, so I want to take these ones, but the low level ones are...

[Speaker 1]
If you're in Osrim Hub and you're getting ready to disembark, Mark Kuhl, the warlock, who's sort of not leading this expedition, but doing a lot of research, sort of your liaison for the crew and other people who are more familiar with spelljamming and how to sail across the Astral Tides. A tour guide! Yeah, yeah, he's kind of like a tour guide, but he's learning on the job.

He went over and he found that the Astral Storm that had recently cut through, that you folks narrowly avoided, left behind a kind of canal. The Astral Tides, they look like a C that's flat, but really it's a bunch of separate currents that are mostly invisible to each other. If you're on a current, you're mostly not going to see people on other currents and stuff like that.

You can't actually see everybody else out there. So he found one current that was left behind that went through the deep, could be used as a shortcut, and he wanted to leave a return buoy there. Because sometimes the return journey is hard.

Sometimes you run into emergencies, and it's this kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, so long as the buoy's not destroyed.

[Speaker 4]
Was that where we met the Astral Devourer?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that was the moon. The Astral Devourer was on the moon, on a moon of Brachios. Specifically Ellen Isle, so it's like the blue icy moon.

[Speaker 4]
Was that the moon that people went to and never came back from?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay. Sometimes it's called the Eye of Ellen Isle.

People think that there's something nasty sleeping or a cult. Cults occasionally come up with the idea that something nasty is sleeping inside the moon. Not that they haven't done that with the other two moons, but they tend to fixate on that one.

Ditto for the Cult of the Eyeless.

[Speaker 4]
It'll be interesting to see if that continues happening without the Astral Devourer there. Or was he kind of transient?

[Speaker 1]
Well, he was certainly eating there for a while.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, by the moon?

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
There was also the Dreadnought there, but that could have also eaten some of the explorers.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well there were two critters. The Astral Devourer is like a swarm of tiny aberrations. And the Dreadnought is like the really big one with those crab claws and the single big eye.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, yes.

[Speaker 1]
But they were in the same hole.

[Speaker 2]
I've gone and scrolled all the way back up to the summary just to take a look.

[Speaker 1]
It is where you folks left a return buoy, though. You did leave a return buoy there. After you killed the Astral Devourer.

Which is funny, because I wasn't sure if you guys were going to kill him. I didn't know how that fight was going to go. Because he has a lot of damage, but not a lot of defense.

[Speaker 2]
True. And he also did have the anti-magic beam.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, that was fun.

[Speaker 1]
He's like, I don't know how much this is actually going to throw off when I think about it. It's like a Beholder fight. It could be really sweet.

He did set out a Beholder for seven willows. That was the nice part about the OGL nonsense coming out. It's like, ooh, Beholders are Creative Commons now.

Oh, nice. I shouldn't super copy-paste them, but... Oh yeah, this one is the old PDF, so we'll use that.

So Mark Cool finds this canal. It's connected to the Deep, which is the realm that only... I actually don't know if any of you have been to, but I'll give you the lowdown on...

Para has been there. So Para would be able to provide an explanation. What was it?

Rana's been there as well. Rana, when she first exited the school, took on a special project to look for the Book of Exalted Deeds. And this led her on a search to find that the...

to suspect that something called the Prince of the Deep had swallowed this book and would regurgitate the book across the course of Taliesin's ballot. So the Prince of the Deep, this entity that comes from... The Deep is a lower plane.

It's not known what its exact location is in the World Tree, but it's a place that everything else kind of falls to if it's not swallowed up by the Abyss, by the Maw, as most people here refer to it as.

[Speaker 3]
As opposed to...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
Just asking to clarify, because I don't think I wrote this down in my notes correctly. Is this where Lyrian had heard about a special, like, Bladesinger sword being trapped in a demon?

[Speaker 1]
That is at the... That is... The Bladesinger sword is...

Ooh, actually, shit, maybe. Because there's the spear... No, okay, so I think I got confused.

Because there's a spear that is in the Abyss. Is that in your notes?

[Speaker 3]
I have a sword spear which is buried in the chest of a demon at the bottom of the Abyss.

[Speaker 1]
At the bottom of the Abyss, yes. So that's the Abyss. And what is this?

This is just the Deep. It's a kind of garden realm with a lot of LEDs and computer, I guess, electronic... Not technology, but electronic material kind of woven into the rest of this garden.

It's a realm mostly of, like, long corridors of white limestone-like blocks that just have a lot of... I'm thinking of the Feywild, but if it was cyberpunk, I guess. And awfully quiet.

[Speaker 10]
Athenius, I imagine you're noting all this down, right?

[Speaker 3]
Of course, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
No, I was asking because I wondered if I should have been typing it up as well.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Just open up the notepad here. So we have the Deep, which is a cyberpunk garden realm with large limestone blocks.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So they went into this place that Rana went... Sorry, Rana went into this place looking for the Prince of the Deep. Went into the wrong portal, more or less.

Went into the wrong location. Because there's more than one that leads to the Deep in Cemed. And they faced basically a number of different trials throughout the Deep, until they came across an entity that called itself the Willow of the Deep, and provided some additional information, provided Rana specifically some additional hints as to where the book was, as long as the Prince of the Deep, in exchange for either Rana's soul, or returning the book, or bringing the book, to bring the book to the Willow at some point within the next 49 years, I think? For his thing it was seven years, but seven years in the Deep is 49 years in real life.

[Speaker 3]
So the book that she could give instead of her soul was owned by the Prince?

[Speaker 1]
No, the Prince of the Deep is an entity that's sung about in Taliesin's ballad. Taliesin is the Fey Lord that's most celestial in appearance. He's called the Saint of the Clovercord.

His deal is he fights alongside an archangel to a soul or something like that, to imprison this fiendish entity, now fiendish entity, that used to be called the Gardener, and basically reseals it inside this one hole. During the fight, basically each time this happens, the Prince of the Deep would swallow the book, and then he would be sealed so nobody could access him, and thus the book would stay sealed along with him. Rana eventually recovered the Book of Exalted Deeds and read it, which forces it to disappear and reappear somewhere else in the multiverse.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, good for her! Well, for reading it, lest that it's now missing, but hey!

[Speaker 3]
So it's missing, and the willow wants the book, or they'll take possession of Rava's soul?

[Speaker 1]
Right. So all this is just background for the Deep itself. You folks are now going, currently in a canal, on this journey to get the assassin repaired to whatever form she might have had before.

[Speaker 4]
Hang on, I have a question.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah?

[Speaker 4]
Rana pawned their soul?

[Speaker 1]
It was only if the book was not returned. Rana was very, very intent on bringing the...

[Speaker 4]
The soul is in pawn. It's either you pay with the book, or they keep your soul.

[Speaker 1]
Right, okay. Yes?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I just wanted to make sure I had mused myself correctly.

[Speaker 2]
No, you haven't, right? So, about the time thing. So seven years in the Deep is 49 out here, so their years are seven times longer, yeah?

[Speaker 1]
That's... No, sorry, I got it backwards. It's seven years slower in the Deep.

Their time runs slower in the Deep. I did it backwards.

[Speaker 2]
So, one year here is seven years in there, basically.

[Speaker 1]
No, sorry, one year there is seven years here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so, correct order the first time. All right, thank you. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Is Lyrian attuned to the Sword of Brilliance since he defeated the Marilith who held it before?

[Speaker 1]
I feel like we went over that a few times. He has to defeat the... Oh wait, no, I think it happened again.

I think it did, because what happens is the Marilith comes back.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and you have to defeat it again.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and I think that you did defeat it again, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. Right, so yes, now you would be attuned to it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Does that exist in Foundry, or should I make a custom item?

[Speaker 1]
You would just have to make that in Foundry. It's a pretty simple sword, it's just extra d8s. Oh yeah, yeah, that's not a...

All right, so at this point, you guys have gotten to the canal. You're moving through, and you're getting ready to... The whole point of this journey is to take Whatserface, the Assassin, as she's been called, to the Brilliance of Ion, dip her in this pool, and hope that this restores her to some kind of normalcy, if restore is even the right word for it.

You folks are going through, and she's been under this gentle repose spell for quite a while. And her eyes open. She's still dead.

Undead. Dead. A dead undead.

But her eyes are open now, and she's looking around. She looks a little bit frightened, and she's kind of fixated on one direction as you guys are moving in. And when I say moving in, you're moving through this canal on the Astral Tides that begins to be encroached on by the deep itself.

There's a beachhead, more or less. Again, large limestone blocks that are just kind of funneling you towards an endpoint that's unknown. Plenty of vegetation on either side.

Most of it alight with LEDs, copper wire, and the occasional computer microprocessor that shows up either at the base stem of the plant, or shows up in kind of the limestone blocks itself. Paira and Mimosa, at this point, have dedicated themselves. They've decided that, like, we're going to stick right next to the Assassin, and we're going to try to keep anybody from taking her, and dinner from Markpool.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so she's looking in a specific direction. Where exactly is she looking at? Like, can I turn to try and face what she's seeing?

Sure.

[Speaker 1]
Her eyes are slowly tracking this thing through the walls, literally, of the ship, and the limestone blocks. And as you get closer and closer to the midpoint, she's looking further and further left. Like, you guys are just about getting perpendicular to this thing as you go through the corridor.

There is another corridor that is perpendicular to you. It goes back leftwards. See here, you think of this realm as basically being a giant grid, but you look leftwards, and at the end of a longer hallway is a, not a clearing, it's like a coliseum.

It's been carved out of the limestone, or obliterated out of the limestone. It looks like the back end looks like a giant radar dish. In the center is a metal ball that's mostly bronze, and kind of, it's like bronze and chromium.

And it has a bunch of arms that have been, like, retracted to its sides. It's hanging suspended from a ceiling that similarly looks like a large radar dish. Or, sorry, satellite dish.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Is this a central telescope? What am I thinking of? Is it low transmission?

What is that place? This is going to annoy me so much if... Because it was actually, if the place in real life was destroyed.

[Speaker 2]
What are you looking for?

[Speaker 1]
Arecibo? Arecibo! Puerto Rico!

It basically looks like that, but upside down. And the large ball in the center has a bunch of arms on it.

[Speaker 4]
Are they moving?

[Speaker 1]
It is not moving. Mark Kool is just setting up the return buoy at this point. He's halted the ship.

All right.

[Speaker 2]
I will wander to our undead question mark assassin and ask what she's saying.

[Speaker 1]
You hear a voice shouting from over by the... Those of you on the top deck will hear a voice shouting from over by the edge. And it's only you folks.

None of the crew can hear it. Not even Perra and Nessie can hear it right now. It's only you folks who can hear it.

Shouting way, way, way over by that ball with arms.

[Speaker 6]
I see a converter. I don't know where I got that word.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Did her mouth move at any point during that voice? Okay, that's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Shouting over, it's just, it's just, it's something that wants to change me. I think it wants to change you too. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
How do you reckon it's going to do that?

[Speaker 9]
I'd rather not find out.

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough. All right. Well, because the three of us can hear it, I will warn the rest of the crew that in fact something is in the lungs and trying to change us.

And it seems to be around the metal ball thing and is a bit malicious. Probably should be on guard as they say. Maybe investigate the weird metal ball.

The rest of you, how do you feel about recent developments?

[Speaker 4]
Not super enthusiastic.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Anyone have cool ideas on what to do? Because currently I'm a little blank.

I'm drawing a blank.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, my intuition is fly faster and get out of here.

[Speaker 2]
Mark Coole is currently fixing up the buoy. He's not done, is he? No.

Right. He's currently setting the buoy. So we are going to be here for a bit.

For a bit. Please don't leave me here. We shall not.

No worries. At least we'll endeavor not to.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, there is the small image of the assassin that's over by the center of the Coliseum I mentioned earlier.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, OK. That's no good. I will try.

It might not work, but I'll try to dispel magic on that thing.

[Speaker 1]
It's like far down. Like, it's not like right next to you guys.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's far, far away.

[Speaker 1]
The voice is coming from far away as if it's being echoed downwards. I say as if it is being echoed back towards the ship. There's no indication that the assassin is conscious or speaking or she's not moving or anything like that.

The only thing that's changed since you folks entered this place is her eyes are open.

[Speaker 4]
Um, Merrill, cast, um, Detect Evil and Good.

[Speaker 1]
The air is composed of fiend.

[Speaker 4]
Of what?

[Speaker 1]
Fiend.

[Speaker 4]
OK.

[Speaker 1]
Normally when you cast Detect Evil and Good, it's like, you know, you get like a ping here and then over here and then maybe over here. This time it's just yes.

[Speaker 5]
OK.

[Speaker 4]
I can't decide whether or not I should hold my breath. It's a bit late now, I imagine.

[Speaker 2]
Right, so we don't have a lot of good options here. We could go down to investigate the metal ball hanging in suspension. Hope we don't get smoked mid-air.

We could also wait and see what happens. Probably not the greatest of ideas considering that thing wants to transform us. And beyond that...

We can't exactly move because, again, boy... I can't pronounce that word. It's being put in place.

[Speaker 1]
No, we can move whenever we want, but if you're saying you're seeing something out there and the assassin's out there... Do you want to leave whatever that is behind or do you want to... Is this a question of whether you want to leave whatever that is behind?

[Speaker 5]
I think we do.

[Speaker 2]
Kinda. But we're starting to see an image of the assassin in there too, so...

[Speaker 1]
That's what I'm referring to, says Mark Coole in character.

[Speaker 2]
Right. I appreciate that, Mark Coole. Not in character.

[Speaker 5]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm going to take, I don't know, a loose pin from the ship or something and head on down to investigate. Do any of you have flying mounts of your own or something?

[Speaker 3]
I have a griffon.

[Speaker 4]
I've got the mojamor. Awesome. Down we go.

Carefully.

[Speaker 1]
So, you progress downwards towards the converter. What the assassin was referred to as the converter. You get to the arena and the arms begin protracting...

The arms begin deploying. And they're reaching downwards towards the center of the room. You can now see the image of the assassin.

It's standing right next to you folks. It's not in the center. Assuming that if you were ground level it would be standing next to you at the entrance to this place.

The converter has deployed its arms downwards towards the center. It looks towards you folks. And then it looks back down.

And looks back towards you folks. It just keeps doing this over and over again. And the assassin says, I think it wants to play a game.

[Speaker 2]
Dear assassin, do you know what sorts?

[Speaker 4]
Well, it's got a lot of arms. Maybe it wants to play fetch. Do you know what...

[Speaker 5]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have like a spare rock you can throw?

[Speaker 1]
Right. Okay, so the assassin's image... You see a rock form in the middle of...

You see a rock form at the center of this place. It's composed mostly of obsidian. It looks to be some gallium or mercury inside as well.

There's a metallic liquid sloshing around.

[Speaker 4]
I think that's a yes.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, well. So the assassin is standing right by us, assuming we're on ground level. Are we within arm's reach of her?

Or just on the same level?

[Speaker 1]
If you're on ground level, then yeah. You could be within... She's just standing there.

[Speaker 2]
I poke her. To test her tangibility.

[Speaker 1]
Goes through.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, alright.

[Speaker 1]
I apologize.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. To the weird rock formation again? To the weird rock formation.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, let's do it.

[Speaker 1]
Assassin, so... The rock formation starts pulsating and turning into a little bit more of a ball. Oh, okay.

It's like gesticulating and kind of like... Becoming like pokey and spiky and then it goes back to being smooth. All while this metallic liquid inside is still sloshing around.

She says, I think it wants... Either it wants an offering or if it wants... Either it wants an offering to destroy this or it's...

I think it's going to... Well, it's going to fetch it to you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, what was the first one? It wants an offering to what?

Oh, sorry. Repeat what you said.

[Speaker 1]
I said, I think you're the ones who are fetching.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Shakespeare says either you can destroy this thing or you... Maybe have a way to counter this thing that's being thrown at you. It looks to be alchemical in nature.

Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
How heavy does this thing look?

[Speaker 1]
A large boulder the size of a medium boulder.

[Speaker 9]
Right. Okay. Probably about, like, let's say...

Let's say about 500 pounds.

[Speaker 2]
500 pounds. Okay. I could try and catch it with telekinesis and we will not get squashed.

It's just perhaps the liquid, if it... It might count as part of the same structure. So, I could attempt to catch it.

Oh, yeah. Okay. I cast telekinesis and the thing is flying to us.

Let me just ping that. Also, this is a genuine question, just so I know. Would we have had time to rest on the way here or are we just straight from the last thing?

You would have had time to rest. Cool. I'll deal with my stuff later, but I'll just...

Do it one time, sort of, in this room. I'm going to switch computers real quick. No problem.

Then I can deal with my stuff while you're doing that.

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, let's... That means I will toss this next one at the bar. Hey, it's another alchemical ball!

Phineas, mid-toss, there's another one that's getting ready to come at you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. How heavy do these things look? About 500 pounds.

[Speaker 4]
About 500.

[Speaker 1]
It's really going to hurt if it smacks into you.

[Speaker 4]
I'm loading into Foundry to look at my spell list.

[Speaker 5]
Hi, Tia.

[Speaker 3]
How big is it? How many are there and how big are they?

[Speaker 1]
Right now, there's just one that's coming towards you. Heart has resolved hers.

[Speaker 3]
And it manifested out of nothing?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
It manifested out of nothing, or is it coming out of, like, a...

[Speaker 1]
It's manifesting out of nothing. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
If I shoot it, does it look unstable? Like, if I shoot it, does it seem like it might explode and, like, be bad for us?

[Speaker 1]
That will... It could go well if you were to, for instance, roll well. Okay.

Good.

[Speaker 3]
I'm tempted to just cast Odaluk's Resilient Sphere and let it just crash into the sphere. That could work. Yeah, I think I'll do that.

I'll cast Odaluk's Resilient Sphere.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to cast Teleport. I'm going to let the sphere get almost all the way to the ship. And then I'm going to teleport it back to under the arms.

[Speaker 1]
I have not rolled yours yet. We'll see what happens. Okay.

It is a similar... You don't have to mark off Teleport just yet, but it might be useful for you. So, the third sphere that this thing develops is...

The third sphere that this thing develops looks like a ball of just pure... It looks like a miniature sun. But it's not like...

But the heat that's coming off of it is warm and fulfilling to those of you who use magic nearby. Phineas' Gun, which is normally pretty ice-cold, normally I said where he loves to use it, feels all of a sudden warm to the touch. The Staff of the Archmagi feels warm to the touch.

Ysrigan feels, which always feels nice and comforting, now somehow feels doubly so.

[Speaker 9]
Do you have Oberon's Wreath out, by the way?

[Speaker 4]
It's a 50-50 whether I have it or I left it guarding the red dragon egg.

[Speaker 1]
You could have called him to you at this point.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, then I'll have him.

[Speaker 1]
If that hits you, it's going to change us. We're going to be fine, but that is going to... My curiosity is getting the better of me.

And it will throw it towards you.

[Speaker 4]
But it feels like a good thing? It feels warm.

[Speaker 1]
It feels like a... Do you want to make any checks or anything like that on this thing before you choose a course of action?

[Speaker 6]
Because it does feel good.

[Speaker 4]
Can I roll Perception? I mean, I really want to do Insight on this flaming ball. But I'm not very good at it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're not very good at it.

[Speaker 2]
If you do maybe an Arcana check, or any Intelligence check, because it's a problem you want to figure out, I can help you with that.

[Speaker 1]
So this is something that's going to... It is going to feel good. It's also going to...

And you will feel recharged. But it will also stress you after a while. And a little bit of you.

It's not going to take a piece of you. It is going to take the shape of you and copy it.

[Speaker 4]
Honestly, that's probably something that's already happened to Kyrona in the Feywild. So she's not that worried about it.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. So we just see a Sun hit you? I'm just going to mark down one Stress.

But besides that, nothing happens. And then two more rounds of this.

[Speaker 5]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
All three of you, roll me a d6, please.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Oh. Oh dear.

[Speaker 1]
Phineas, what do you have for me? For a check... Mr...

Are you Lyrian right now, or are you Silk? I am Lyrian.

[Speaker 3]
We're in the Brilliance, right? Yep. Yeah, definitely Lyrian.

Um... I cast a little Extrasilient Sphere. Uh...

So I'm hoping this thing will just bounce off me.

[Speaker 1]
No, sorry, I need you to roll a d6 to figure out what the...

[Speaker 5]
Oh! Let me look at that.

[Speaker 8]
Alright, Harley. You have another... You have another Alchemical Ball.

[Speaker 2]
Yay! I put down the last one and I cast that one with the same Telekinesis.

[Speaker 9]
Can you target a different object with Telekinesis?

[Speaker 2]
Alright, fine. I was going to put the weird Alchemical Ball... Actually, can I?

Is it solid enough for me to put down? Anyway, alright. I was going to put it down with the same casting and cast the other one, but I think I can't do that, actually, so we're going to throw this ball at the one that's flying towards me and hope it doesn't splash back.

[Speaker 8]
Make me an Arcana check.

[Speaker 1]
Yay! In the meantime, Kyrona and Lyrian, you also... Well, Kyrona, you get a Magic Ball again.

Lyrian, you also get a Magic Ball tossed at you. It's something that feels nice and warm, but you know that the Sensation is going to stress you. Or, at this point, you're aware that the Sensation is going to stress you at some point in the future.

That's a success. And it's going to take... The Deep is going to take your shape.

And... Well, for its own purposes, it's going to take a copy of your shape. Me?

No, I'm speaking to Lyrian and Kyrona this time.

[Speaker 3]
It's going to take my shape. Can I polymorph myself to make it take a different shape?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'm going to polymorph myself into a chicken.

[Speaker 4]
Merrill picks up the chicken just to make sure he doesn't get squished underfoot. Sorry, buddy. It's busy up here.

I don't want you to stay up to get him stepped on. Please don't peck me. Oh, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Well, aren't you delightful.

[Speaker 1]
And, Kyrona, are you still taking that same bargain?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I will.

[Speaker 1]
So be it.

[Speaker 4]
1d6 again.

[Speaker 1]
So, Lyrian, you will still take Stress later, but you will not be... Your original form will not be taken. There will just be a chicken made of LEDs and plant roots somewhere in this realm.

[Speaker 3]
Excellent.

[Speaker 1]
Black goo. Amazing. All right.

One more d6 from all of you.

[Speaker 5]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Kyrona and Dr. Basu, you get the ball thrown at you once more. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well, I don't have anything in my hand right now, so I catch... Well, not hand.

Grasp. So catch it with the telekinesis I had up.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. And Kyrona, what do you have?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it seems she deafened.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, she's cooking in the meantime. All right, we'll go to Lyrian, who has a different result. Lyrian, there is a ball here as well, but it sucks in all light and appears to be sucking in the air immediately around it.

Despite this immense pull that you feel in the meantime, there are several what look to be the arms of a starfish emerging from the exterior of the ball, and occasionally just, like, lapping in its surface like it's water. It's going in and out and in and out like you're seeing a sea dragon from afar.

[Speaker 3]
How far away is it?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's approaching you very soon. All right. What does your chicken do?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll drop concentration. I'll probably barf, let it fall off. So it's, like, vacuuming up air around it?

[Speaker 1]
Like a sphere of annihilation, but there's something inside. There's something living inside of it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. What I'm wondering is if I can have my familiar deliver arcane lock. Does this thing count as an entryway?

Is it like a portal to another realm? I'm wondering if it counts as a door and if I can lock it shut with arcane lock.

[Speaker 1]
You can certainly try. I don't know if an arcana check or an attack roll would be better for this, so I will let you decide.

[Speaker 3]
Or maybe if it gets a save against my spell decent?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what to set this thing's save as. I think it's going to be an expression of your skill here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, do you want me to make an attack roll or maybe an arcana skill check? I will let you decide. So choose.

All right, I will do the arcana skill check and I will add in three scholar dice.

[Speaker 1]
Very good, that will be a success.

[Speaker 3]
Yikes, not my scholar dice.

[Speaker 1]
Fly, Archimedes!

[Speaker 3]
Archimedes does get sucked in, though. That's okay, he shunts to an alternate dimension anyway.

[Speaker 4]
What did I miss?

[Speaker 3]
There's like a floating black hole coming toward me, so I have my familiar cast arcane lock on it. To kind of like bind it shut. But he got sucked in by it and shunted into his other dimension.

[Speaker 4]
Is it still coming?

[Speaker 3]
I think it might be coming, but it's inert, so I don't think it's going to suck anything in.

[Speaker 1]
It was locked and the starfish arms that are coming out are coiling themselves around the arcane chains that are now wrapped around this ball. You see the briefest glimpse of a multi-eyed organism with a small beak poke out for a moment and then retract, pull the arms in, and then the sphere shrinks.

[Speaker 4]
Chirona waves.

[Speaker 1]
The converter waves back. And constructs. Oh, that's right, Chirona, there's another alchemical ball heading towards you.

[Speaker 4]
Sure, third time's the charm.

[Speaker 1]
How do you want to respond to it?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'll accept it. No, I know what I'll do. I'll try and like bop it like a volleyball.

[Speaker 8]
What are you hitting it with?

[Speaker 4]
Um, hands, arms.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think that was just going to kind of meld onto you on contact. Chirona, you are covered with a, your regular armor and jewelry and all that has been re-stylized. Chirona currently looks, Chirona has been like, made to look evil.

Chirona has been given an evil makeover.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl does a double take.

[Speaker 1]
Splashes over you. That is going to be another point of rest.

[Speaker 2]
I want to emphasize, you trying to volleyball hit a 500 pounds of what is rock, gallum, and mercury, what looks like that anyhow.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, we're fine.

[Speaker 4]
I'm impressed, but like... Things are only impossible if you decide they're impossible. Fair enough, fair enough.

But hey, nice look.

[Speaker 7]
You look a bit sketchy now.

[Speaker 1]
The converter says you're right. I don't really like the thought of that though.

[Speaker 4]
It's talking now?

[Speaker 1]
It's, well, we're communicating. It says you passed the first of three trials. And we can go through the door now.

Converter strings together out of nothing, just a bunch of hands moving together. Constructs a portal that looks like just geometric, concentric circles going, moving backwards. In this white and very pale teal light that's interstitched with a grid.

[Speaker 4]
Hey Mark, are you done yet? No. Alright, I guess we'll keep playing a little while longer.

[Speaker 2]
I'll follow into you, but I'm going to keep an eye in general on you. Actually, hold on. One sec.

I'm going to check something just before we go into the cool portal of sorts.

[Speaker 1]
Mark's going to be back soon, by the way. I can see him. I can see a lot of places in this place.

I don't think I'm leaving unless you get this thing to let me go.

[Speaker 4]
I'm still myself.

[Speaker 2]
I don't feel evil. Well, I'm going to bop whatever, well, darling, I'm going to bop whatever gunk has gotten on you so we can just check, you know?

[Speaker 1]
The spell completely, the spell fails. You are not able to sense any magic gunk, Irohna, at all.

[Speaker 2]
So you understand why that's concerning, right? It said it was going to change me. No, it's nothing at all.

Can I detect any past magic items, or is it literally nothing at all?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can't sense any kind of magic items or anything like that.

[Speaker 2]
So, the spell usually detects something, even though it's not what I'm looking for, but I cannot detect anything on you, which is worse. It is worse.

[Speaker 4]
I think it's cool.

[Speaker 2]
So, it is. In some perspectives, it is. This is fantastic news for research purposes.

However, I will bid you caution, just in case it's either you or your magic. I imagine you would not want to lose that, yes?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, definitely. Right.

[Speaker 1]
Due to all this technological... I was kind of hoping to see what would happen if the evil ball hit the chicken. If the makeover ball hit the chicken.

[Speaker 2]
It's not impolite, don't worry. It would have been interesting, but... And I sort of just turn.

Well, considering it made Kyrona look, and I put quotation marks, look evil, I imagine it would just be like, sort of metallic-ish chicken? Just all in black, maybe a cool red studs in it, as you were. Right, so, I imagine we want to go explore the portal that's being conjured for us so we can be the assassin companion.

Seems a bit trapped. On we go, then?

[Speaker 4]
I posted Kyrona's new look in voiceover flow.

[Speaker 2]
I love it.

[Speaker 1]
Nice.

[Speaker 7]
Right, so.

[Speaker 2]
We'll go through the portal, hopefully. Because this place is full of technology, it is possible it's simply disguised in your magic, and it hasn't used you as some sort of battery source, but again, caution. We shall deal with it in due time.

Onwards?

[Speaker 1]
Right, then? So next, when you folks move through the portal, you are alone. Each of you are alone, with the exception of the assassin.

Each of you can't see your teammates, but you can see the assassin. Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
Meryl feels the chicken disappear and goes, oh no, and starts patting the ground for him, wondering if he turned invisible.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, sorry, just to go through this, so we're all individual, we cannot see anyone else except the assassin?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 10]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
At least for a few moments. And then you see a copy of yourself at the other end. That is less than delightful.

[Speaker 2]
Right, then.

[Speaker 1]
You're free to kill this copy, negotiate with it, try to buy it off.

[Speaker 2]
Right. I'll first ask the assassin if, since we're the only two here, if, because it could be a mean problem, I ask the assassin if she can see anyone else, and if she can see my copy.

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean? Yeah, I can see all of you. To the other two of you, this comes completely unexpected.

[Speaker 2]
If you don't mind, do you mind pointing me in the direction of one of them? Like, walk up to them, put your hand where they would be?

[Speaker 1]
Sure, they're right here. Okay. Continue with the, she's actually...

No, that's my bad, I was trying to figure out how to explain it. Just point to a spot that you had actually moved through and interacted with, that you would have, like, bumped into.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, that's less than ideal. How far is my copy from me?

[Speaker 1]
Within combat distance, or talking distance.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'll ask them what they want. Okay, buddy. What do you mean?

[Speaker 1]
I want eternal life.

[Speaker 2]
Picked on the notes, but fair enough. It's your fault I want it. Do you know how you got here, specifically?

[Speaker 1]
I don't like talking about myself that much, actually. I tend to keep things a little bit close to my chest. Okay.

I think it's how I got Wistar in my lab, to begin with. The original trials.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, well. You guys confront your own inner demons for now, as I...

[Speaker 1]
Lirian, how are you responding to your doppelganger in front of you?

[Speaker 3]
Is mine a chicken?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you're not currently a chicken.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you identify as a chicken, then probably.

[Speaker 3]
I'll start reciting the Elvish alphabet backwards, and see if it mimics me. It does. Okay.

I think this was a dungeon in Zelda. Okay. Okay.

I draw out a... My... Petrichory Raper.

Rapier. Not raper. Rapier.

[Speaker 1]
Nah. That's not the... Smite D100.

[Speaker 5]
Pretty good.

[Speaker 3]
I pull it out, and see if it pulls out a duplicate of it.

[Speaker 1]
It goes for its side, and it does pull out the rapier. Okay. It's holding it at the moment, like inspecting it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... I want to...

[Speaker 1]
It is misty around you, so the rapier is very activated right now.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I want to cast Detect Magic. I'll use the slot to cast it quickly.

[Speaker 1]
It does detect magic on the other rapier as well. Right now your clone is kind of following your... your doppelganger is following your lead.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'll talk to... I want to assess like its mental age, and if it has free will. Or if I can kill it and get...

and double my loot.

[Speaker 2]
Practical.

[Speaker 1]
Make me an insight check. If you fail, it's going to make a kind of... it's...

It's going to get the idea of what you're trying to get at.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, not good. Not subtle.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. I think that warrants another... How do you want to...

how do you want to save this? Or wait, no, I'll let you think about that for a moment. Dr. Basia. Hello, yes. All right, back to my demons then. So what are you...

how are you interacting with this entity?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I... I... As far as Dr. Basia has inferred, it's something that's sort of just like repeating...

I guess, your... Deeper bits of your personality are just repeating back your past, and it's just like, well, this isn't really getting anywhere, but you can try to make something of it. So currently, he's trying to think of the best...

like a question to ask it on how to lead, but... So, we'll start with that. Right, that is probably how Y-Star and I...

The whole Y-Star situation happened. It will work out fine, and seeing as we both want eternal life, we can't exactly spend it all here, as it is, in fact, for everyone. Even if we could, we can't actually.

So, if you don't mind... I'm pretty sure the only way out is through you.

[Speaker 1]
That's the only way out for me, anyways.

[Speaker 2]
And how did you come across this equation?

[Speaker 1]
Don't think that you can come with... You just know this? I'll send you a postcard if I figure out any more.

Alright, so I think... Go ahead and drop your character on the map, and I have to duplicate you. That's Fallen...

Phineas... Frog... Cart...

There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Where do I drop it?

[Speaker 1]
Anywhere. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
I might have put him somewhere I shouldn't be.

[Speaker 1]
No, I didn't say anywhere, you're fine. I pressed duplicate... Where is...

Second Dr. Basu... Aha!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hey, it's me!

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait, this has... Let me turn off Token Vision. Alright, can everybody see it now?

It's not like a proper map.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basu. Full initiative. Yay!

[Speaker 2]
Alright, one moment.

[Speaker 5]
What?

[Speaker 2]
Did it... Oh, it did. Oof, that's not a good roll.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it looks like Dr. Basu 2 is going to go first this round. Go on. With Phantasmal Killer.

Right? I just had it. I was just looking at it, like not two seconds ago.

[Speaker 2]
If you type in the search bar, you should be able to find it.

[Speaker 1]
I don't see a search bar.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, in search spells? Oh, that works, too. I'll just screenshot what I meant, just in case you can use it later.

That would be cool.

[Speaker 1]
At the bottom? Yes, I tap into deepest nightmares. Need to make a saving throw or become frightened.

[Speaker 2]
This is what I get for making my DC stupid high. Oh, thank god. Still take psychic damage, though.

[Speaker 5]
Are you going to roll for damage?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so. It's at the end of each of your turns. Oh.

At the end of each of your turns.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So that's that one's turn. Now it's up to... You.

What have you got for me?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, awesome. I'm not dealing with this right now. So we are going to put him in a cube.

And we are just... No, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Counterspell. Seventh level.

[Speaker 2]
Rude. Well, then I cast Counterspell. Counterspelling is Counterspell.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, where is it? Here we go. What level do you cast your Counterspell?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I can't cast it any higher. You know, if I don't be silly about it. So what we're going to do is just do our best to roll.

Which is third level. So... He wants it.

Spellcasting ability check. Cool. Which is a plus six.

Spell one, two, three, four, five, six. That failed.

[Speaker 1]
That did fail. Well, no cube for him. Start of the next round.

I will...

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to clear initiative. And...

[Speaker 1]
You made zero. Alright. This is very funny to me.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like there's a bit... There's a message here with me going second.

[Speaker 1]
I don't have... I specifically don't have a message for this one.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's number two's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Why not? At second level I'm going to cast... Nope.

Where is it? Magic Missile.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Oh wait, I don't have my reaction anymore. Right.

[Speaker 1]
I suppose not.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, have I gotten it back? Of course.

[Speaker 1]
Start of the next round. So once I deal... What is that?

That's four dots. Eight damage. Eight.

Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
That is...

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basu's turn. Dr. Basu two. Cool.

Awesome. Now it's your turn. The original.

[Speaker 2]
Yay. Alright. Well, it's very unfortunate that I'm fighting myself because I don't know exactly what nonsense I'm going to get up to.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
What have you got for me, Dr. Basu?

[Speaker 2]
You know what? I'm going to try and take a page out of Phineas's book. I don't exactly want to, in no better ways to put it, kill myself.

So we're going to see if this works for now.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basu, the doppelganger is going to cast Counterspell at fourth level. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I'm not going to bother with...

[Speaker 1]
You do have a reaction.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. I do. Alright then.

This is... This is me going... I'm going to go and roll my thing again because I'm not expending higher spell slots on this.

[Speaker 4]
That sucks. Every time!

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well. You don't get to fourth level, though!

I do! Yes, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like you should... Yeah, I feel like you should go... Oh, no.

Alright. Alright. Anything else on your turn?

Any bonus actions?

[Speaker 2]
Bonus actions. Do I see anything behind this nerd?

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 2]
As in, is there a space behind him? Like, over here? Okay.

Is it just more void or is there something there is what I'm asking? Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It's like an arena. It just kind of goes out into nothingness.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Well then, I don't have anything for my bonus action then. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Now go ahead and reroll your initiative.

[Speaker 5]
Fuck. Yes! Finally!

[Speaker 6]
Good lord. Round three. You're up.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. Awesome. Great.

We are going to do polymorph again.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. If you're casting it at fourth level, it's going to also cast its counterspell at fourth level. Cool.

Awesome. Oh. It's mirroring your...

You do have your reaction back because it started your turn. It is mirroring your spells.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's fair. Well, we are counterspelling that counterspell, yes, with my fourth level slot.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It fails. Thank god.

Well, Basha too turned into...

[Speaker 2]
I would turn him into chicken, but then he could hurt me. So we're turning him into a frog.

[Speaker 1]
The chicken could be dangerous.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm not risking my eyes being pecked out. You're a frog now.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Dr. Basha. you begin fading back into like a more, a slightly more normal area or room we could say. Now you're back in like somewhere in the grid corridors as is like you're like slowly phasing back in and you can see the outline of Kyrona and Kyrona so far but you don't have any other visual details just yet.

Phineas, what is the Lyrian doing?

[Speaker 3]
Am I also, did my doppelganger, is it taking any hostile action since it might have seen my intentions to kill it if it is not sentient or doesn't have free will?

[Speaker 1]
It is not, so it is not taking hostile actions yet right now it's like considering what to do.

[Speaker 3]
I'll try to engage it in conversation. Okay. I will introduce myself and ask for its name.

[Speaker 1]
I think my name is also Lyrian.

[Speaker 3]
What memories do you possess?

[Speaker 1]
Well, all of yours. I have a lot of good ones here actually. It looks like I'm gonna go through a rather...

I remember growing up in an elven cairn. The name doesn't really mean anything to me but it looks like I had a decent number of friends and acquaintances and colleagues at the cairn.

[Speaker 3]
Huh. Do you know that you're a clone?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. No, I understand that. Okay.

I feel you poking at the subject earlier.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. I'm not a not known for my tact.

[Speaker 1]
I suppose we're not but I'm definitely not just disposable.

[Speaker 3]
It looks like that there are you. What do you think of our of our current situation?

[Speaker 1]
If long life has taught us anything is that actually a lot of things can be put off to a later date. I would like to get out of here at some point but I don't think that all this get reabsorbed back here. Once a realm like this has taken an action it can't really just take it back.

It kind of goes against the law of the lower planes.

[Speaker 3]
Is there any way that you can see for us to both emerge from this the situation fully intact?

[Speaker 1]
I can. Yeah. Somebody can come back and pick me up at some point later but if I agree for the moment if I agree now wholeheartedly that I will if I were to agree wholeheartedly to to concede our conflict here then you would be declared the winner.

That means that you would get out. But I wouldn't die. I see but you wouldn't be stranded?

In a manner of speaking. So I'm going to request a you know I'm going to request that you swear on the things that you hold dear those lovely memories from your time in a real home and a real society or real culture that seems to have found some affection for you enough to trust you with an expedition to the lower planes that you come back here and pick me up on your way back up.

[Speaker 3]
Very well for for the sake of as a as a measure of trust and security why don't we exchange a lock of hair to each other to so that we might be able to scry and detect one another will make retrieving you easy if if you if you changed positions unexpectedly.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah and that's probably going to happen. Nothing really exists in this place so it's going to happen often. I don't know where I got that idea either but deal.

Phineas begins fading back in as well. At this point you folks can see Dr. Basia with a holding a second familiar. You see Lirian exchanging a lock of hair with his doppelganger which itself starts as Lirian fades in.

As Lirian fades in the other Lirian begins fading out and you see kind of like this like grid architecture like underneath like you see the skin kind of like flake away to reveal like this this this grid like a human like a human nervous system but like made of geometric like just made of circles and lines like a wire frame almost. Before that slowly starts disappearing and you see Kyrona. Do you want to describe what they're seeing as you fade in?

[Speaker 4]
So can they see my copy or is my copy like fading out?

[Speaker 1]
They can see the copy first before the copy starts fading out.

[Speaker 4]
Okay Kyrona and her copy are full on making out. Just sloppy style hands all over each other.

[Speaker 1]
You can persuade each other to cooperate. We've seen several different iterations. The full spectrum of generosity.

[Speaker 2]
What did you say Merck? I'm sorry. I was.

I'm in awe frankly. My relay failed so I had to fight my Lirian had a pleasant conversation and it was nice and they came to an agreement. You're having the time of your life making out with your doppelganger.

Fair enough.

[Speaker 3]
You know when I said go fuck yourself this is not what I had in mind. Then you should have been more specific.

[Speaker 2]
Is either of them winning in this scenario?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't want to have to roll for that. The thought occurred to me it's like well somebody needs to technically speak English. I could just assume.

That's fine. I didn't think of the bar.

[Speaker 4]
Whichever one of them gets to third base first is the one that wins.

[Speaker 1]
It's like it's a game of chicken.

[Speaker 2]
I like to think that you know just after that thing and they fade back into existence and I'm like oh cool everyone's and then my eyes just focus on whatever Kyrona's up to and I'm like right then.

[Speaker 1]
Who knew it could be so much easier?

[Speaker 2]
Now Lirian's there so I'll ask him how his doppelganger thing went. Am I in possession of the frog or did it fade out of my view?

[Speaker 1]
The frog is currently fading away that's correct.

[Speaker 3]
Sweet. Things went well. I am obliged to return at a later date and assist my alter ego in escaping this place but for now we are good to go.

[Speaker 2]
It would have been nice if I could have just made an agreement with mine and I give a look to the frog but it seems he was less than reasonable.

[Speaker 1]
I look back as it disappears.

[Speaker 2]
Oh and I say this to the frog just before it disappears if you're willing to converse Tarith should we meet again I will be willing to have a pleasant conversation that doesn't end with this. And then I let him disappear to wherever he'd been from.

[Speaker 1]
The assassin's very interested in everything that's been going on it's like that was pretty exciting to watch. It was tense actually.

[Speaker 2]
Well I'm glad you found some entertainment from this. I'm surprised we didn't see one of yours but I guess it's because of your lack of tangibility.

[Speaker 1]
I also think so. I am technically dead.

[Speaker 2]
That's probably it.

[Speaker 1]
I think those were actually the second and third trials. The first one is just up ahead. I'm sorry?

I don't know how to explain it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay so we did the first trial. We did the second and third maybe. No we did the second and third.

[Speaker 1]
The first one is next.

[Speaker 3]
Oh it's like ranking. We're going up the tiers.

[Speaker 1]
No because we did the second one first and then the third one second. I don't want to think about it too hard. You folks see four pillars are up ahead.

They are basically around this realm's equivalent of a coffin. It's not just been ported straight out of your world. It looks almost like a computer.

It looks like a battle station. Like the ultimate gamer chair is in front of you. The screens, LEDs, flashing lights, sparks all shaped around entombing a person.

A rather small one in this case. The problem being there's only three of you and four pillars. And as you begin moving the pillars begin following you.

The assassin shouts out, these are supposed to be pointed at me? No they're supposed to be pointed away from me. To let me out of this thing?

[Speaker 2]
Pointed at you to get you out.

[Speaker 1]
So as in... Like her image just flashes into the coffin. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And what happens to her as we are?

[Speaker 1]
That's what's happening right now.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Cool. Awesome.

[Speaker 6]
They follow, she shouts out from the coffin, they follow people and they follow magic.

[Speaker 4]
Well I'm currently not detectable as magic. Maybe if I use polymorph I won't count as a person.

[Speaker 1]
There's four pillars right? They're pointed inwards towards the coffin. And what the assassin is saying is to have them point outwards so she can be released.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. And there's only three of us but there are four of the pillars we have to turn.

[Speaker 1]
And right now they're only following two of you.

[Speaker 2]
Which two? Me and Lirion.

[Speaker 1]
And Dr. Basia. Swank. Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
So we need to get them pointed away from... Away from the center. The center.

So they all need to be tracking different targets then, right? Yes. Cool.

So there's one currently targeting Lirion? Two currently targeting Lirion?

[Speaker 1]
There's one targeting Lirion and there's one targeting Heart. At this point those of you who have taken stress, which is to say... Dr. Basia you have also taken one on account of your conflict earlier.

[Speaker 5]
Lirion too.

[Speaker 1]
Lirion didn't fight his doppelganger.

[Speaker 3]
But he got stressed earlier from the pulse. I got stressed from the orb.

[Speaker 1]
So you got stressed. So all three of you at this point are beginning to reverberate in place. Like you're seeing double of yourself as you're looking down.

With the exception of Kyrona who's seeing three others.

[Speaker 2]
Delightful. Awesome. Cool.

They follow the magic. So I'm going to try and cast a thing for one of them to follow instead. Let's hope this works.

So if you count six...

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to put this one on a five minute time limit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
Cool, cool. I have a quick suggestion. Mhm?

Why don't you two stand between two of the pillars? And see if the other pillar will activate and trap you. Track you.

[Speaker 2]
I'll do that. I also want to try casting animate objects. And see if it will track that magic thing.

I will do the pillar thing while... Okay, cool. It's only following one of you.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I have a pillar following... Lirion has a pillar following him, right? That's correct.

So he can just orient that pillar correctly away from the center now. So he'll just go stand there.

[Speaker 1]
The suggestion is to see if two pillars could activate to follow you. And that doesn't quite work. Only one follows one person.

[Speaker 2]
Swick. So is it a magic and a person? So animate objects would not work then since it's not following...

[Speaker 1]
When you cast animate objects, it briefly follows the huge object that you animate. And then you feel your control dip and it sprouts arms and legs and begins running away.

[Speaker 7]
Huh. Well. Rude.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Converters should be careful making things that are like people here. They tend to get up and run.

[Speaker 2]
My dear companions, do any of you have any sort of summoning things that you can do on a dime so we can turn it immediately, so to speak?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I got conjure elemental.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome, cool. I also have unseen servant that I learned. So if we cast it on the other two that are non-functioning at the same time, we should be able to turn them, albeit briefly, away from the coffin and hope that works.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you cast conjure elemental. What are your instructions to the elemental?

[Speaker 4]
Um, just stand so the pillar faces away from the coffin and don't run away.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, make me a persuasion check.

[Speaker 4]
I'm good at that.

[Speaker 2]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
The unicorn stronger than the spider. I'll follow the unicorn. And you, Dr. Basia?

[Speaker 2]
I was... I was also going to cast to make a person, because they're fundamentally humanoid, the unseen servants, and they should be able to track that, but it's not visible. Do I have elemental?

I swear I have it on the staff. I do, actually.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if that would be enough to drag this thing.

[Speaker 7]
Right, elemental it is then.

[Speaker 1]
Summon elemental is the one that you can do instantly, but conjure elemental is the one that takes an hour. Do you have an alternative? I'll give it another two minutes.

Oh, that was a really bad time for heart to fade out. Oh no! Heart, you can just...

[Speaker 4]
With my staff, I can make a pact with someone so that they can cast my warlock spells. So I can make it so that heart can cast summon fey?

[Speaker 2]
Howdy. I am back. Sorry, my battery died for a moment.

What happened when I hit the... No, my... Yes, okay.

Anyway, it's back on charge. What did I miss in the second I had disconnected?

[Speaker 1]
So conjure elemental would take an hour to cast. Summon elemental...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it does!

[Speaker 1]
Bar is offering to give you a warlock slot to cast a fey spell.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that would be fantastic.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Alright, so you just need to make a persuasion check for this fey.

[Speaker 2]
Oh dear, charisma's not a good stat of mine. It's a plus one! This is what messed me up last time!

Okay. I'll take it. It agrees.

[Speaker 5]
It agrees! Yay!

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. A version of Lyrian, a version of Dr. Basia, and two versions of Kyrona are now standing at the edges of these pillars. And the assassin has been released.

You're suddenly looking at it from very far away, back on the ship. And you're seeing it, like, you have an awareness of where it is, and you can see it as if you had, like, a bird's eye view. But you're back on the ship, and you're definitely not looking towards this place in a straight line.

You see a machine, of mostly machine, but with quite a bit of the ferrous, microprocessor-laden, circuitry-engraved wood and limestone of this place walk up. It has three eyes, two horns, something equivalent to a cannon composing its right arm. And it smashes the coffin.

But that's okay, because the assassin's standing next to you again. Kyrona still has that, like, black, kind of, like, goop on her, and Kyrona still has one spare version from this place. So I need Kyrona to make me a, if you would, go ahead and make me a wisdom saving throw.

You succeed, and you're going to take some madness.

[Speaker 4]
Kill!

[Speaker 1]
It is technically indefinite madness, but it has a, let's see here, but it does have a specific end condition, which is whenever this extra version of, whenever you fail, this extra version of you is going to be let loose. Oh, that's funny. I try to become more like someone else I know, adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.

[Speaker 5]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 1]
Where are you going for Noah, Kyrona?

[Speaker 5]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Would it be too much to say that, like, I'm going to imitate the evil copy of myself? Because she still looks different.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yeah, that'd be fine.

[Speaker 4]
Kyrona's gone to the dark side.

[Speaker 1]
Very nicely done.

[Speaker 4]
Cleary.

[Speaker 1]
That's all I have for this episode. When you... You folks exit the canal and see, in a side room somewhere, like in a side corridor, you do get the brief glimpse of a...

Which ones were cloned?

[Speaker 2]
What were you going to ask, Hart? Oh, I was going to say, you said the end condition is when you fail, the evil version of you is let loose. What did you mean by that?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't say the evil version. Just the spare Kyrona that's living in Kyrona right now.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yes. The spare Kyrona. What did you mean by...

So, she's going to have to make a save every so often, otherwise the spare version is let loose?

[Speaker 1]
No. Once Kyrona fails the save, the version is let loose. Every time Kyrona succeeds, she picks up more madness.

But once the version is let loose, then the madness goes away.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And she has to do this three times?

[Speaker 1]
I didn't say three times.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Well, good luck. We're just going to keep going until that eventually happens. So there might be a very, very, very insane Kyrona let loose at some point.

But that's not going to be Kyrona's problem.

[Speaker 5]
Yay.

[Speaker 2]
So we get a brief glimpse of as we leave?

[Speaker 1]
As we leave, we get a brief glimpse of a clone of Kyrona also, because Kyrona got hit by the goop. A clone of Kyrona is currently being constructed. Delightful.

Two clones of Kyrona. And one chicken.

[Speaker 5]
What's that?

[Speaker 1]
Clone Kyrona is going to need a familiar. So I'm going to assume it's that chicken. And it will have the features of a wizard.

It will be a full wizard chicken.

[Speaker 2]
I've been plagued by a wizard chicken before. You can't believe here again. What a coincidence.

I love that.

[Speaker 1]
But besides that, thank you for.

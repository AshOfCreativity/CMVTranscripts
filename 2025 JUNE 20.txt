[Speaker 4]
Cannibalism. I'm not telling her that. That's something she would share.

[Speaker 6]
But she'd appreciate the humor.

[Speaker 3]
Except for she would tell her teachers, and so when we have a meeting next, it'd be like, oh yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Hey. I see. So we hear you're talking about cannibalism.

What to explain?

[Speaker 4]
Only as a cautionary tale.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, we got to teach the five-year-old not to eat the meat.

[Speaker 3]
Well, she's picky anyway. I'm not. The only one of my children be concerned for in a zombie apocalypse would be Rosie because she eats anything.

She wouldn't care. She'd eat the meat no matter how shady it was. Yeah, pretty much.

My son and Yelena, they're too picky. They'd survive. It'd be great.

[Speaker 7]
Rosie, I'm not sure. Especially because she loves meat.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yelena would be like, of course, I'll take some. I'll take a huge helping.

And then she'd eat like the bread part of it and leave everything else. And Zach would just be like, no, I'm not hungry. No, I'm not eating that.

It's not a chicken nugget. I'm good. It's not a cookie.

It's not a chicken nugget. It's not chocolate. He does eat better stuff, but like basically.

Basically.

[Speaker 6]
So James is finally here. Does James have a microphone?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my goodness. I am glad that I went to take him to the vet.

[Speaker 6]
Did they find anything? Well, he's got.

[Speaker 1]
They didn't find anything specific. They just went over like, hey, this is probably like we got fleas to worry about. We got parasites to worry about.

We got dex mites to worry about, which I was correct on. And I did guess from the start, because I've been dealing with mites for a little while myself. I don't have an actual skin condition.

So that was a happy moment of pride for me. I'm mostly just happy I went there. Make sure that there wasn't a sudden expenditure of $700.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I was looking down like, oh, let me look up any of these prices online. Like, well, he does need to get the rabies vaccine, but we're not doing the vaccine. I'm like, oh, that's totally fine.

Yeah, we're not doing the vaccine today. I'll schedule that for like some other day. I'm pretty sure he got the three year one last year, but I will double check.

Either way, no, I was not going to pay $50 for clay RX.

[Speaker 7]
What was the clay for?

[Speaker 1]
Was it literally just clay? It's RX clay. All right, so it's not.

Well, it's probably like sifted. No. So it's like the edible clay?

I'm not sure if you're allowed to. That might be bad to eat. Dimestitious earth is like very, very sharp.

[Speaker 4]
It's food grade. You can brush your teeth with it.

[Speaker 6]
That sounds like. It kills like bugs. It does.

It kills bugs, but it's too fine to hurt humans.

[Speaker 3]
Dimestitious earth.

[Speaker 1]
So, well, the way it kills bugs is kind of the same way moon dust eats through the Kevlar of like human spacesuits of the moon.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's incredibly sharp.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And that's the, that's probably. So, so it's not going to affect your skin.

However, if you are breathing it in, in any way.

[Speaker 6]
Breathing it in. Yeah. But you could still eat it.

Well, if you're eating.

[Speaker 1]
I hate that you're eating it.

[Speaker 6]
It's food grade. So is the meat on the table on the farm.

[Speaker 1]
So they say when I inhale my food, it's a euphemism.

[Speaker 4]
Did you say it's a euphemism for dick?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that was the punchline. That's what they call it. Bar.

[Speaker 4]
I just wanted to make sure whether or not I heard right.

[Speaker 1]
It's probably not. I can make whatever drinks I want. The, uh, what's.

[Speaker 3]
It's just meat from the barn.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody go ahead and drop the characters off of the thing. It's just $700. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 3]
An expensive boy. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, I brought it down to 275.

[Speaker 3]
Hi, Rosie. Hey, sweet girl.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't mind paying a little extra for the, for the rest of the stuff. Cause I'm like, all right, well, I don't want. How quickly do I want to get him fixed versus like going out to go buy all these things?

Like, no, the money, the extra money is absolutely worth it. Me not having to go through and sort through all of these.

[Speaker 6]
The Gabapent was a pretty decent price. My vet charges. 30 for the same amount.

I think. Yeah. Gabapent.

[Speaker 1]
Is that cause. Is that the antibiotic? Or is that the.

[Speaker 4]
That's the killer. Pain killer.

[Speaker 1]
And it also makes it creepy.

[Speaker 6]
It's what I give my cat for his seizures.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Look at that. So he can intentionally stride across your keyboard.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Lady. Looking at my food. Would you like some?

There you go.

[Speaker 1]
He'll be on the wrong server. Cause I was trying to find a, I was trying to find something accidental and I was immediately greeted with this wonderful. It's a wonderful thing.

Let's see here.

[Speaker 6]
You weren't invited to the elephant.

[Speaker 2]
What was context for that? We had gotten right. Elephants.

Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Them.

[Speaker 6]
Were they just sitting in a zoo somewhere?

[Speaker 3]
It was really funny. They were at Sierra's keep. Along with all the other animal companions and any other NPCs or whatever.

It was our junk drawer of. The zoo. Yep.

I mean, Elephant.

[Speaker 6]
Sierra's going to have to get her keep again. If I remember clearly. Wait, no.

Landy's here.

[Speaker 2]
He can explain it.

[Speaker 5]
Explain what?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. When we were talking about how the keeps and stuff vanished in the reset. Right.

I remember, I think it was James who said, oh, but Sierra's was made technically timeline wise before the reset would have happened. So it would still have the keep. And you specifically said, nah, I don't want it.

[Speaker 5]
It wasn't that I don't want it. It's that there is something very scary. They're waiting for us that we dealt with last time before moving in.

[Speaker 2]
What is the scary thing that's waiting for us?

[Speaker 5]
I believe it's a night Walker, which is like a challenge rating 21 creature. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Jesus Christ. How did you beat it?

[Speaker 1]
By one person who had just been sent like 10.

[Speaker 5]
We sent like 10 play a character.

[Speaker 1]
Is that it? And like three, I think.

[Speaker 2]
I see. Okay. Yeah, that makes more sense.

[Speaker 3]
No, you can keep this time around. I'm good.

[Speaker 5]
I'm Aaron's play. I've made a saucer for it. I remember he was talking to auto before about wild magic.

And then he's just like, he's dead. So funny.

[Speaker 1]
It was really fun. I felt really bad.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, sorry. Repeat that. Who was talking about wild magic and then just died.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think you have people that used to play. He was talking to auto as new and he was talking to other about wild magic and stuff. And then the next message was just that he's fucking dead.

[Speaker 2]
I see. Okay. So it makes sense.

Then why? Yes, and we are very low level, like compared to the level eight starting. So, well, I suppose that's, that's for higher level us to deal with later.

[Speaker 3]
If at all, that's future as problem.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see. Plague is technically, excuse me. He was hiding over here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so clink right now is inaccessible, but you are going to have control of him soon in a limited sense. So you do need a dip. So Nessie does need a.

[Speaker 3]
I've got Rose. I've got my, my trash Panda.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. And then who else are we missing on the board here?

[Speaker 6]
Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 2]
He's he's there.

[Speaker 6]
I don't see Dr. Basha. Oh, on the board. Ah, right.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm not feeding you here. Take the spoon. Midway.

[Speaker 1]
And then does this import link still work? I should have. Is this still possible to just like straight up import?

Characters.

[Speaker 6]
What do you mean? Into. Yeah, you have to make a new character and then you have to right click them.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
And you should be able to import. You have to own the character though. Yeah, you should be able to import.

It might not work. I think there's a module that fucks it up. No, it should work because you don't have the one that fucks it up.

I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Speaking of modules that fuck it up. I need to.

[Speaker 2]
Hopefully you're going through modules. I do hope that. That during skeleton cave.

The doctor here doesn't straight up eat the dirt because he hasn't quite leveled up level three yet.

[Speaker 3]
I was waiting for you to go on both.

[Speaker 1]
If you could go on both like adventures, it depends on where skeleton cave is.

[Speaker 5]
That's a good question.

[Speaker 2]
To be fair, it happens in two days after this. So unless this takes more than one day.

[Speaker 1]
Skeleton cave. Skeleton cave doesn't take two days after this. Today's today.

What day is it today?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, today is today.

[Speaker 1]
Skeleton cave happens on Sunday. It does happen. You were correct.

[Speaker 2]
It is two days.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no. I was thinking of the other session, the sizzler.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no.

[Speaker 1]
The sizzle.

[Speaker 2]
I thought I was losing my mind for a second. You were just. Not the way I thought.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, speak me log back in from setup. Okay. So be.

The kick you guys out.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, dude. If you're enabling modules, you should probably help enable them. The other one.

What's it called? I think I said that we didn't need it, but I don't want the add one assistant one. Turns out it is.

Turns out it is actually necessary. Oh, refresh. Okay.

I actually had to refresh to get it to load.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're all going to have to refresh. Unfortunate.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's bad. Oh, that's gross. That's yeah.

Well, I have these like electrolyte drinks. And I know the extent of my water. It's gross.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sorry, Matt.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah. That's.

That's almost. I'm good to go. I'm going to close out the other tests, but not eating up everything.

And then Landy. I do think that, That Nova would be too high level for this. I'm not gonna say no I Have a solution.

Don't worry. All righty. I mean Rana could Rana could also do I mean Does she have enough money for a ghost touch room or she know if she's gonna borrow a sword from her good friend.

No Hey Very good Is everybody on the map then just what I will do in that case Where to go No reset all my favorites are you joking?

[Speaker 5]
No, that's us It's okay, I guess I've decided Rana using that swords a very bad idea so I'm gonna bring my penguin Here She has no way to negate Ghost Resistance, I don't think she can really out damage it so she would do Not much Not really she's trained She Could do that, that's it She's a thaumaturgy, so she Yes Wouldn't that give you the ability to exploit the weakness? That's only if they have a weakness most ghosts. I only have resistance Don't that is nullified by ghost touch What about Okay, I guess Like even with the personal antithesis she could do I don't think it would still I Think I'd be better off just bringing all of a one character that cast spells Excellent You guys are going to get down to the basement where you find What clink slugs Links legs dangling down.

[Speaker 1]
No, so clink is like basically sank down a week ago So you've been spending time preparing?

[Speaker 3]
He's been gone for a week Taking over the tavern

[Speaker 4]
I mean while he's You know gone Rose roses like we're raising money for the funeral of the own previous owner And clings in the basement and it's like sometimes we can still hear his voice

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes we can still hear him I

[Speaker 2]
Saw all proceeds go to her the doctor will like to remind her that she owes her him 16

[Speaker 3]
When I've collected all the money

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm Of all the characters you you've borrowed from it's the one that's actually going to nag you about I know

[Speaker 3]
It's great

[Speaker 1]
Does this double

[Speaker 2]
Hell yes Penguin

[Speaker 5]
It's just he's just a penguin black yes I guess he's known for a penguin.

[Speaker 2]
Huzzah. That's the best one This was for the bird thing the otter was Right, whoops all birds Yeah, but I have to wait for clink to be available for oops all birds Is quite going to come back from the dead Once we figure out how to oh, yeah I wonder do you keep your ghost feats if you come back to normal or do you get to replace?

[Speaker 6]
I do believe they have to replace them.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that makes sense. I replace it Well, yeah It would be fascinating if one was still scarred by the whole being a ghost thing and kept like there's actually a whole set of Feats that you can take if you've died before called the reincarnation feats.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yes I've seen those we were allowed to take them if we were using a character from the last session if I recall Not last session last timeline English We were supposed to add ourselves to initiative weren't we? Yes, please It better than the bird at least I have that going for me Still bad But The penguins to That's that's incredible I'd love that for him Is he allowed to smoke in clink spa Yeah Really?

[Speaker 1]
As you went down from the basement door to the basement you were presented with and And transported to a dark reflection of clink spa It's

[Speaker 3]
Had a nickel for every time there was a dark reflection of him you'd have to He's not here to steal the shit like last time so dark reflection

[Speaker 4]
Misty Smell that cigar smoke I

[Speaker 3]
Mean if I got that smokey he would get pissed but

[Speaker 2]
I Was the last time you're transformed into dark reflection, I'm genuine curious about that now I'm in his original campaign It's like how did I miss something no, that's cool I

[Speaker 1]
Got

[Speaker 3]
Dimensions, yeah, he stole the bag of his dark of his Dark image, which I think is so funny, which made him very disappointed.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah Is your level one character on the board, yes, it's ominous penguin Oh, okay, does he have a dramatically scarred face?

[Speaker 2]
No He does not help you say no, ah, yes, of course What do you mean by that?

[Speaker 4]
This is a hundred percent not in character. Mm-hmm You are going to start off by simply attacking Meryl Fuck off That was out of character Meryl would not say that Let Meryl say fuck When Meryl says fuck, you know that things are extremely bad So we have to haul and get out of there.

[Speaker 1]
Yes I mean it's tiny Oh I'm gonna spread out here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh He's going to throw a bomb Oh Wait, no, oh I forgot for Canada's ghost touch She's gonna go over here. It's that's a Stab again Then you can see the hero point on that no

[Speaker 6]
What is this this is me

[Speaker 4]
Does anybody ever told you that you have kind of weird character concepts You mean fun And yet somehow

[Speaker 5]
Thank you, I think you're outnumbered here by weird character concepts to not

[Speaker 6]
All right, Kofi is going to run away from this guy And then she is going to do a spell strike upon him Stink bomb I do have a stink bomb.

Actually, I think it's an acid bomb. I Don't think my bow is gonna do anything but the Ignition Ignition is It takes the ignition damage Oh James, do you want to post the spell strike thing so you can read it? The spell strike I don't know what you mean Yeah, basically I cast a spell and I shoot so he takes both damages of the weapon and the spell What is that from?

[Speaker 1]
Magus Fun And then that is me I Still get these two actions on it. That's fine. We're gonna attack Rose By killing Rose Please don't kill her From roadkill you came and from roadkill you'll return From roadkill she'll come back.

Yes again dedication

[Speaker 3]
Again, then we're gonna knock her down

[Speaker 2]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
The feels like I'm playing a go right now, um, hang on hang on

[Speaker 4]
Strike so I can protect Rose

[Speaker 5]
Rose would have taken full loss damage

[Speaker 4]
So you have need for resistance and I can do that to the first one

[Speaker 1]
You know, it's only made for attack I had to move twice because they only have a fly speed of 20 feet All right, so you instead of 14 you do it by 4?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, you do it by 4 I Have manually set you to 7 No, the second one went to Penguin oh I'm gonna put myself back to three.

[Speaker 3]
I should be up by four.

[Speaker 1]
Yes 15 feet 15 Yeah, okay. All right. That's my mistake.

I thought you're talking about you click on Merrill.

[Speaker 3]
You can see it Good job you A9. Dear god, I can't take another hit, please Yeah, you're very good Yep That's all three actions Oh James over here.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's too high for this kills three of us I'm not stressed at all bar.

[Speaker 5]
Don't worry.

[Speaker 4]
I have a plan I There feeds ghosts taking damage.

[Speaker 3]
No The one of the right has this one has You're using your ghost touch weapon I Should be yeah, I Don't know if there's anybody on either side of the enemies by you, but you do get flanking with Rose You do not get flanking with the skunk though, she's too small Well, it's got moved also, oh I lost it again No, it's for the best you have to lose What does planking give me It gives you a bonus.

[Speaker 4]
What was the AC how much by like two?

[Speaker 2]
Which counts I do not like the Jenga nonsense. They're getting up to Oh No, no, sorry. I was targeting I meant to be targeting the ghost next to Rose.

[Speaker 1]
Are you sure? Yeah 24 credit while it's flanked not while it's flying What was the hit 24 Yeah, you miss it by one again, I'm sorry you missed the trip by one So hit then you do have a third action you can intimidate I raised my shield, right? Oh, that's so good Come back to this guy What is that a ghost dog Sick yeah, unless I'm zoomed in like super close.

[Speaker 4]
It almost just looks like a guy Some kind of spectral sex party Naked people on their hands and knees in the middle of the tavern You can hear quakes is the voice.

[Speaker 3]
Whoa, whoa, whoa go into the back rooms.

[Speaker 4]
This is an establishment Things have been established. All right, clink Keep it up public.

[Speaker 3]
I think it's free.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna grab the ball yard real quick Again hey Real fun stuff starts next round.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no I've got I've got a question Does it cost on like one action to force-feed someone a health potion if you're holding like a versatile vial or something? Yeah, cuz yeah Dump it in. Yeah.

No, no. No, I was just wondering if it costs only one action.

[Speaker 3]
That's that's all only one If you already have it in your hand, then it should only be one but you have it in your hand Sick.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. I'm going to do that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no You don't need to heal me. Oh, you're good.

[Speaker 5]
No, you can heal me if you want, but I'm good Do you it doesn't look like I am but I am I'm gonna cast heal on my turn.

[Speaker 2]
So, okay. All right. I'll leave you people I'll just attack the the next best thing, which is this guy in front of me.

I'd rather he not be Where are my spells? There we go. We're going to try to explode the guy With all three actions Roll damage one Two Three Okie-dokie Which one do you have target?

Oh, there you go. The one right in front of me double check Very good. It does not look good Sick awesome.

I and that's all my things so I'll end my turn. Oh Another one of these guys is going next first. Okay, these freaky dogs kill me.

It sucks, but Oh being flanked do not like Oh, no, I refuse to be killed by somebody who's into pet play. Hold on I do not wish. Thanks I'm just gonna reduce that damage a little bit Hey guys Oh So you destroyed the barrier, yeah, but you don't hit me So no damage whoo-hoo Are you sure you don't get damaged by that?

Yes, because it has a two of hardness and five hit points so it would destroy the barrier but not hurt me. Oh Right That's true It does it exactly yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, exactly no damage Very good Thank you It is time to cast three action heal we're hitting everything I'm fine. I Think I avoid hitting clink with this, but I hit all the ghosts and I hit all of the people so Except for this dog. I'll need everyone good I'll roll the healing for the people The three and then every ghost gets to make a fort save.

I Should have targeted them my bad.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's all right. Oh, and then they take that. Okay, so

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah, the ones that succeeded will take one and the fails will take three Rose and Merrill Hill for three Thank you

[Speaker 1]
To go see

[Speaker 5]
Okay, that is all three actions

[Speaker 1]
Here right Rebecca died Our billboard progresses Come to a whaling ghost I

[Speaker 4]
Didn't know Hmm all we got many whalers

[Speaker 1]
Oh

[Speaker 2]
That's like

[Speaker 6]
I need to roll

[Speaker 3]
No, you don't that's his time you're on his time right now, oh Okay, well

[Speaker 1]
My success you are temporarily immune to this ghost with you know Anybody fail the DC 18 first succeeded Merrill succeeded The penguin man DC

[Speaker 6]
CC also succeed Oh CC also see it's in the way you pinged it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah I Have two actions left so I'm gonna oh, hey Bruce is there Come at me I'm Merrill would have a reaction back again.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yes You deserve it. Okay. Don't ask me if roses are saving.

[Speaker 2]
Oh And I which one attacked her the one to your left the one that I get a melee attack on it you do nice So Rose heals for four again, oh awesome cool Holy Obliterated it does not get its second attack, which I was gonna use to go Rose.

[Speaker 3]
Oh Rude I Didn't process correctly my brain until just now Are you proud of me hot reminding people of rules to help us instead of Yes, very Very much stuff another ghost light appears nearby.

[Speaker 2]
All right, that brings us to That delays my compilation of you asking for people to die by a week

[Speaker 3]
Oh

[Speaker 5]
Sorry first early was the bar image that shouldn't have us it only had clink

[Speaker 3]
And typically under normal circumstances should be taking those dogs

[Speaker 2]
They're trying to

[Speaker 1]
It's It is just the

[Speaker 3]
This guy takes this guy would take splash and then technically this these if it's applicable because it's everybody within five Yeah Well, no it's dead Oh Yeah, sorry, I was too busy

[Speaker 4]
Making dead raccoon noises. Yes.

[Speaker 6]
I Am going it'd be nasty. Yes, you're sitting on me

[Speaker 3]
Okay, listen I Bad but she blends it My little grandma eyes couldn't see her You love how small she is

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna do an electric arc on the two that I have targeted to They have to make reflex saves and And Landy does this count as a cast a spell as far as arcane cascade is concerned I Don't know it's tackles this arcane Yeah, but I cast a cantrip and not a spell I don't think so, okay

[Speaker 5]
That's what recharges a spell strike, right? Yeah Uh, never mind apparently Yeah, apparently it does count.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, then I'm gonna use arcane cascade Apparently people use this to restart my spells so ah, I mean that would make sense cuz like I

[Speaker 5]
don't leave the stratus to cause shield to Get a one-action trigger of arcane cascade Then you get to spend next time reloading your crossbow fun Thank you for saving my poor penguin

[Speaker 2]
I will all reject

[Speaker 3]
I'm fine to all black and white

[Speaker 6]
Rose is also kind of a black and white animal.

[Speaker 3]
Rose is a black and white animal

[Speaker 5]
Let's go a CC

[Speaker 2]
The CC stack boy

[Speaker 5]
Do you really want to know The most the most oppressive thing a penguin could think of climate change

[Speaker 3]
What was this

[Speaker 1]
Basically it creates a shit ton of debris Oh, I'll take a little bit to the bar swing around, you know knives and forks and bugs and things like that

[Speaker 2]
That's an excellent name for a penguin by the way, but why

[Speaker 5]
He's as edgy as possible, ah poor lad

[Speaker 2]
But

[Speaker 5]
I guess in the case of the valley the climate change is good because it's getting frozen over and he's a penguin.

[Speaker 2]
So I do actually wonder what I Was waiting here if we're gonna do the Was I was but now there's only one person.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it is an emperor penguin just one extra melanin I didn't that didn't go, right? I should have How bad is that for me?

[Speaker 1]
That should be a 13 this fight me do how bad this fight I Write it should be it should be a 13 because you know, I applied the frightened which made the DC but that would still fail as DC still 18 Focus clip in there.

[Speaker 3]
Oh I'm being sat on Mm-hmm Which really sucks for you because as much as you're a skunk I bet Rose Skunks actually don't like the smell of their own stink. That's why they are really hesitant to yeah spray So also if it makes it easy easier to chase you can call her Cleo I Made roses, um armor like extra height isn't she's got a flap of high She's so canon accurate.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Oh Successful Little one I will to walk.

[Speaker 3]
Come on. It's just die if he hasn't already taken

[Speaker 2]
If I don't enough all should be well I Dare you it's a perfectly respectable It's a perfectly respectable out you see it succeeded me on the other hand not so much

[Speaker 1]
Oh

[Speaker 2]
So rude

[Speaker 3]
You're gonna attack by a hoarder's house

[Speaker 2]
The gap that's what I get I should I was warned by the smoking inside Again

[Speaker 5]
No

[Speaker 2]
No reverse

[Speaker 5]
I'm down

[Speaker 3]
What did my familiar ever do to you do we think this is one of those times where we should run or like

[Speaker 2]
Go where we're in an interdimensional like hole Are we I thought we were in Prince Bar. We are but we went to some weird nightmare Basement it's both.

Oh Okay, so we can't leave really.

[Speaker 4]
All right barrel Um, I should be frightened one because I do get to keep the second value, which was not a critical failure That's a excellent point.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I Yes, do I get blanking from Batra on the other side you do Flankings not a modifier you add to the attack role.

[Speaker 1]
It's something that's minused from the AC automatically Yes, you see target whaling goes to AC 17 BC. Oh, there's like a little cross on it in the message It's like a 17 we don't see their AC Only when they're attacking us we see ours No, you didn't do that thing where you you didn't move, right Yeah That we still have an extra life, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you So should I be adding flanking plus two or not you should not know no that it does this one this one does

[Speaker 1]
That was wrong you should read it I

[Speaker 4]
Used my redo Then you're only use it once but by your boy, oh, okay No Please

[Speaker 2]
Did you reroll with a hero point, yeah Like you were you right-click the thing and everything it no You should you need to right-click it because you rolled lower so it should have given you a little bonus thing I

[Speaker 6]
Don't know also in that one would not have changed that

[Speaker 2]
It's happening again

[Speaker 1]
You have the stinking death on you and dumpsters

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, that's the dog that makes sense.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that makes absolute sense. Yeah So not only does it want to kill you it also wants to roll when you're wet corpse It's my turn I'm having a fun time.

[Speaker 2]
My bird is alive Which is nice. Anyway, so bird will go first It's just gonna use one action to do that and the other action five that's good Hey three Okay, and then it'll be my turn We're gonna cast to this bad boy Hopefully it dies Oh Splendid damage 11 is it still alive?

[Speaker 1]
Scroll damn you I'm surprised is alive. But yes.

[Speaker 2]
All right, we're going to then do this thing and Hope that it hits Sorry hub, but you wouldn't have actions for it. I would because that was my familiar and it can auto-move.

[Speaker 5]
It hasn't Restart a familiar cut it needs to use two actions to do it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh fiddle sticks. Well, I can't hit it. Thank you Familiar was on don't familiars have two actions

[Speaker 5]
You would have had to command it with an action to make it use Right, so you would be short in action for this Oh

[Speaker 2]
Fine, I shall end my turn then Thank you Let me just get rid of that clear it's a dog It's the dog Yeah

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 2]
Heavily dislike that question

[Speaker 5]
Do I have to be conscious is this an auditory or visual I Can't hear it so I don't need to roll the check

[Speaker 7]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
You're big chilling No, did you now did you fail?

[Speaker 6]
All right, you only failed by you didn't critical fit No, I rerolled from a critical fail to a failure isn't she already frightened too though, yeah I am So it did nothing to you. No, I can't like frightened of right Oh, no, it replaces So she doesn't go to frighten for she just stays at frightened to I sorry.

[Speaker 3]
I thought I waited long enough to see if you were gonna do it or not I'm always When my frightened was glitching out and it just kept creeping higher and higher Clearly your character was scared So the raccoon is Freaking out Anyways back to the raccoon, okay I Don't think she even knew you were there I'm gonna battle medicine Bless you black.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, I'll wait until you've None did you have your zero point to get up?

[Speaker 5]
I do.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh Okay, you can thank me now Okay, um two actions I've got one more I guess I can stop Yeah I Take my damage with my fork Yeah That was a real Lord of the Rings I am no man.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was picturing Sam knocking out the goblin with his frying pan Which is appropriate.

[Speaker 6]
All right There's a picture when he stabs it in the ankle one whaling goes from there two dollars Um Well, I don't like this dog here Well, you know what I can do I can do Reload my crossbow and then cast electric arc on them again I Had them both targeted bitch There Target still on there. Oh I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Um underneath there's a reflex save on the damage there should be oh No, you're right I can click just click that I'm Just click that All right, you got it all right and that is my turn Is that those all three actions Yes, cuz I reloaded my crossbow The idea they're a little crossbow being like a model crossbow Clockwise or counterclockwise clockwise and there's nobody in that area. So Whaling goes Make this not be asking myself. Ah, here we go.

I miss And this again, that's his turn Another debris store Top right and lower. No, I must have done No, we are doing Make me some saves You should probably figure out how to get those things to go away May you please stop targeting my horrible bird as you say, no recall one needs to make a recall Someone be smart He's not smart I think she has to be ah You've gone and dispelled my my bird.

[Speaker 4]
He does have to hang a bit Hey Vanishes into the ether and I it will take a week to get her back And pretend CC's you're familiar for a bit if you want Penguin sit on your shoulder and say Oh Let's just do it again Crying out loud.

[Speaker 3]
No, leave me alone I don't know what I did. I went to click it and then it went up. So I Didn't fail I got I ruled a sick wait I Rolled it and then you rolled it.

Yes. I rolled it right before you did. It was it was a success I thought it was 16.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I think it was a 15, but it was still blue We are tripping over each other I Can have some words about maybe clearing up so debris storms don't happen How do it again If I target the ghosts they should be able to is it shift T for multiple yes, yes, sir Now I do That Yeah, excellent, oh But now everyone else needs to heal for six as well though. All right if I'm Your familiar would be dying not dead Just poof once they get to zero no, I believe they go to dying like players.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's nice. Okay I'll just Your temporary internship as familiar is is on hold Sucks though, cuz I don't have any actions to move.

[Speaker 5]
So I'm still next to all of these store. I Think it's a net gain though.

[Speaker 1]
You're stuck in like a Zelda dungeon right now You That one is gonna do right top right earlier it has to move clockwise

[Speaker 4]
Mero

[Speaker 3]
Recall knowledge

[Speaker 4]
Okay, why I

[Speaker 3]
Mean if you want to so we can figure out how to stop these guys or figure out they are

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I'm pretty sure last time they stopped when we killed them all

[Speaker 1]
That also worked it there's not much left to kill it this way

[Speaker 6]
I mean, you have the dogs.

[Speaker 4]
That's okay How many action is Recall knowledge just one action.

[Speaker 3]
You don't have to do it if you don't want to you can just hit if you'd like

[Speaker 1]
Well, you've already done recall knowledge on this before Um Okay, let's use this in action This way you can make a yours if you're making a religion check, it's only DC 60 you're doing diplomacy It's DC 18 to convince it to like calm down and you need You need to to speak the appropriate right like each success removes an action for the thing if it loses all this action disappears

[Speaker 4]
Um, I also have this

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that is specific to decipher writing

[Speaker 4]
Or to recall knowledge about yeah, the second part is for recall knowledge

[Speaker 5]
Yep, if tenants of your own faith, this would be a Bible's.

[Speaker 1]
This is Rights for trying to calm down dead spirits is right enough

[Speaker 4]
Yep So if it's a failure, then it's actually a success and if it's a success then it's actually critical Yeah, that's nice

[Speaker 1]
Critical it would be a critical success and Yeah, if you wanted to just Convince one of them to calm down I Think we would count that as like two successes

[Speaker 4]
Okay, um, I'm I'll do that to the one that's over where I can't reach it

[Speaker 1]
When you say the one that's where you can't reach it

[Speaker 4]
The one that I'm that's a hell.

[Speaker 1]
They're talking about they're talking about like the debris.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's a spirit in the bell

[Speaker 4]
I'll do it to the one that's right there in the middle

[Speaker 1]
Mark the debris storm is dead

[Speaker 2]
All right

[Speaker 3]
That's one act and you could do it two more times Can I do that

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you could do it two more times You could do You get attack and do it once yeah, whatever you want everyone split it up

[Speaker 3]
As long as it's a feat that like lets you do it because sometimes the feats like you can only do this once around

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that one's passive.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Cool So I'll do it to that one as well below the penguin He's got a world again All right missed how did you get rid of that I Will study ah Okay She probably Says something and it's like language of the dead That kind of makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up Far-off clean feathers ruffle.

[Speaker 2]
He's like hi So that one goes from a failure to a success Good job on the being a local exorcist now, we know who to call ghostbusters Very good.

[Speaker 1]
I'm the dead and it's religion check like it's gotta apply to something like this.

[Speaker 2]
I Legitimately took the ghost hunter dedication when I leveled up I love that All right, and that is the end of my turn So the dogs dead that's just this guy Hello it is my turn Let's see if we can get rid of this dog once and for all and I hope there aren't any more fights otherwise It's Sorry, what did you say? I said the level one characters are gonna have field day with this XP And then we cast this Use three actions Wow three, okay It's dead and that's my turn Which Joyous day, okay Hope he's fine Too small to hit Wait, so who's who's level up here?

[Speaker 7]
Rose coffee And CC, all right, here you go Jesus Good lord, have you guys been like fully leveled up?

[Speaker 3]
Merrill is 21 points away from leveling up The one I have 70 points It's better than one I think Merrill know who Was it just Merrill that was level? It was one point away.

[Speaker 4]
It was Kairona.

[Speaker 1]
It was Kairona.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I knew is one of yours Yeah, that was wrong James you should give me a Bonus XP for being so true to my character concept Everybody could have a your point as well for Do the ghosts leave anything behind or just the general mess No, no, it's general mess.

[Speaker 1]
So what do you guys see next?

[Speaker 4]
I will relate to you after you take a very short break I'm gonna grab a snack I think Okie dokie I'm gonna cast lay on hand on Rose so you get six healing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, thank you. I was worried that I'd have to heal myself You could try I Mean I do have like healing potions, but I would take a guarantee over Over potentially hitting yourself.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's fair

[Speaker 4]
How do concentration spells work in Pathfinder

[Speaker 6]
Um, so concentrations a trait so Okay, so the equivalent would probably be be sustaining a spell where you have to spend an action to keep a spell going Okay, but if it just says concentration in the traits that just means that There are certain effects that limit your concentration for example, like if you get dazed I don't think you can concentrate and it just makes it so you can't cast the spell rather than having to like If you take damage, it doesn't interrupt your spells. Basically.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'm looking at using this going forward.

[Speaker 6]
Oh That one's good Sorry Yeah, yeah that one that only only has a duration of one round So that one you don't really have to worry about concentrating because you you just have to cast a new one every round That being said you'd only get one action to do something else.

[Speaker 3]
But if you just like hit or whatnot, you'll be fine Which I frequently yeah Infectious, I can't describe how much that and then the bardic form makes The difference like that plus one makes a difference all the time the concentrate tag Refers to being able to vocalize the spell.

[Speaker 5]
It's typically how you are able to do that Component of the spell casting it's the same with manipulate being that for your physical Gestures to cast the spell

[Speaker 3]
What number out of a thousand or whatever should we be at level two because there was no button to do the official

[Speaker 6]
Oh If there was no button then you might not have leveled up It was auto added and each level you should have though at very should be able to oh I don't know because Kloofy and Rose have not been in the same number of sessions and I don't know what roses XP was before that

[Speaker 2]
Rose definitely should have leveled up because he's been

[Speaker 3]
Just it's stuck at level one and it's fifteen hundred out of a thousand. Just remove a thousand Okay I Easy for me to fuck that up. I didn't want to do that I'm gonna grab a bunch of painkillers.

[Speaker 2]
I'll be back in a second Dex I really need you to get out of my face, please There are two flies on the ceiling and we're making eye contact Oh, I'm so tempted to take strength like you stabbed better Do what your heart desires No, I'm like more health or stab. Oh For Rose probably Yeah, that's the smart one Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Stay true to your character concept.

[Speaker 3]
I know the smart one is health. The character is staff Then it's whatever your heart desires All right, she'll stab

[Speaker 2]
You know, you can take help now and then take stabbing later, right I know I was gonna do it the opposite but

[Speaker 3]
I was gonna say I'll stab now and hopefully live long enough to help later Okay, I'll help now, you know this you don't think it bumps me up to though, but I guess

[Speaker 2]
Hmm well, you're busy patching yourself up mostly because the money thing. How do you work still like pokes you with a stick? Sorry what Genuine creep this would be genuine curiosity on the doctor's brain probably like poke you with a stick and be like now This is fascinating.

How did you come to like the first time? Don't poke me

[Speaker 7]
You poked me first

[Speaker 3]
Anyway, I I have my jobs Any

[Speaker 2]
Just like I have my jobs Okay

[Speaker 3]
You know, I'm pretty skilled hmm, well you'll make a fascinating study later

[Speaker 2]
As for how I came back to life, I don't know We'll look into this we'll look into this much later goodbye and like steps out to fork stabbing range

[Speaker 3]
If you want to experiment experiment on me you're gonna have to pay me

[Speaker 7]
I have to do her crafting crap might do her crafting later

[Speaker 3]
You'll get a sense dr. Basha that her form of money is stealing manipulating Conning Mainly stealing or bullying Yes, that does make sense Sometimes the odd killing mercenary worth isn't too bad fascinating Just like how

[Speaker 7]
Mostly

[Speaker 3]
Well, if you lay on them while they're sleeping they die pretty fast good point

[Speaker 2]
It seems a bit uncomfortable around the mention of murder, but it's like out of four grains out of stabbing

[Speaker 7]
I love how you play Rose by the way

[Speaker 3]
She's very fun to play Especially good like her own hubris You can't kill me. It's crit hit Oh Coffee would be so upset are I have skunk bomb. Oh Man I can see Rose throwing it in the vicinity of coffee and being like, ah Cluffy that's disgusting I'll get two more stars James what does a penguin have to do to earn 8 XP?

[Speaker 6]
Oh How do you only need 8 XP 990 oh because you haven't this is your first one Yeah, what a great first session for your penguin to be in humanly He's getting rightfully compensated Honestly bringing penguin was the play though the three-action heal is pretty good.

[Speaker 5]
The second one is good first one kind of sucked

[Speaker 2]
How much healing can Rose do with battle medicine again What do you mean

[Speaker 5]
It is a one-action You you're immune for a day To the 8th at the base DC as we saw with Coogee's familiar though, it has the capacity to cause harm How long do our characters have standing around like goons Ten minutes for like one of the typical actions refocus straight wounds Could Rose please treat CC's wounds?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, what do you want Rose to do?

[Speaker 5]
Can you please try and treat wounds me?

[Speaker 3]
How about? instead of that Because I actually want you to heal you taxidermy him You can have one of these I Appreciate the sentiment, but I'm really scared of the wounded condition scaling Also, you would not be frightened for this please take the minus one more rolling Okay, that's huge, thank you Yeah Does anybody want else need healing? No I'll wait.

[Speaker 2]
I'll wait till battle or something since I'm only six hit points off Famous last words, but you know Merrill's actually at full health for once.

[Speaker 4]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hey Congrats.

[Speaker 6]
Congrats I'm gonna check I'll go past the building and see what I have to move forward to Walking Walking too, fine So Nessie not to halt your Celebrations you do get more potions and stuff Or your alchemy stuff Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
I don't remember how much you get off the bat I get two common alchemical items Okay, you've already looked at it. Yeah, I've got it right here. I just stopped because Nandi asked for Yes And then don't forget.

[Speaker 6]
I don't think it matters at level two, but at level three You will get All of the ones you currently have just the higher level versions is gonna be great It is cuz then you'll get the higher level version of the elixir of life Where there's a guaranteed minimum Yeah, that's awesome, that's higher than two Yeah, I can't just oh, this is common.

[Speaker 3]
That's It really wanted that spider bomb The spider bomb is common.

[Speaker 6]
Why can't you have it?

[Speaker 3]
No, it's uncommon. Oh It would have been so good to you throw the bomb and it's on people and then all they can do for their turn Is try to get the spiders off while taking damage A lot of good Thing you can also just take another level one I can take two. Yeah, I'm gonna see if there's any Cuz level two bombs don't really exist I Know there's some buffing ones And then how long is the break that we're gonna take right now?

[Speaker 2]
I'm just about done here Okay The only thing in level three is one general feat which alas Looking forward to level four then CC offers Rose a cigarette after healing him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, she absolutely smokes it with him Both of you have very small lungs.

[Speaker 2]
I cannot tell you how bad that is CC does like the driest awful cough My headphones have decided to cut out give me a second Welcome back Testing Hello still not working.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no Rosa's hands do get covered in ashes.

[Speaker 5]
She heals CC Wait, hang on like he's coated in ash Yeah All birds coated in ash the penguin is coated in ash Rose would not care Dr. Basha says that we shouldn't be smoking up CC gives like the driest like awful cough Possible case in point it is what it is, you know It's time Just sighs Incredibly sad what oh, it's perfect for a melodramatic penguin I Love the Oracle curses That's so good.

[Speaker 2]
I miss how they used to be though What does so are you curse bound one or has it not kicked in yet?

[Speaker 3]
He's just always a bit smoky Good if I become curse bound, that's when I use my focus spells or my Vision my whispers of weakness feature Let me use it on Oracle feet or spell is when you get curse bound Oh The healing Oracle is fun because then your body looks so freakin banged up as you heal people And you can't heal as good Yeah, go ahead and place yourselves by one of the chairs On the map.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, take a chair or stool any chair or stool That's where I sit and CC is gonna be next to you smoking.

[Speaker 2]
Hell. Yeah Just imagine a slightly disapproving look but Considering you are cursed with fire. It's just gonna give the slightest of passes but still going to try and discourage you from doing that I'm saving you That's so funny It's so hard to see with the smoke Oh my god It does like a strobe light or something so you can see where she is Because we can be carried away by a bird.

[Speaker 6]
These are both tiny creatures, but she's she's smaller That's Cuz my tokens probably a little bit bigger Because of the tail Yeah, like technically it's the same size real estate wise but I the tail makes it so that oh, yeah Yeah, I see.

[Speaker 2]
I see the border that makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
So it is very funny to think she's in danger of big birds all the time I Mean skunks, that is kind of just a skunk's life Small babs What archetype do I want to take on the penguin Basically the moment you guys are ready to Finish leveling.

[Speaker 1]
I'll be good to go Okay, but I'm not going to rush you on leveling Everybody pics there Well, the skunk is occupying that seat.

[Speaker 2]
That's why What size is CC Andy what size is CC?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
It's small All right, what size?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, she's small too. Oh her token should be smaller Rose is small.

[Speaker 2]
What just a particularly big raccoon? Hey, not fat.

[Speaker 6]
I didn't say that Call me big Yes inside you now Just like shuffles on the store What size is small on the token Like she should automatically become small My token is so it's why doesn't fill the borders of the yeah So much bigger is because you don't have a circle around her Okay Just pure square do what you're smoking.

[Speaker 3]
I know the perfect archetype for the penguin Catholic mage One might make her poison resistance, I've got a question is life going to get better for your land or is it just gonna get worse He thinks it can only get worse.

[Speaker 2]
All right Well, let's hope it gets better then I'm sure some fire is it wait it suppresses fire resistant does fire resistant items also get suppressed Yes, because sure Everything Boo And I suppose something that heals from fire might be useful Gonna note down your unfortunate curse.

[Speaker 5]
I Don't think I think the curse trumps everything Because even something that didn't make you heal from fire like you're still weak to it obviously, but if you get hit with fire Maybe Because it's not blocking it Typically with the Oracle curses though is that you can't beat them they always win is the General design behind them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh That's a shame How do would it make sense to make her a medic be once again not clicking save on the Token and do that all the time I Am ready whenever everyone else's I asked 20 minutes CC. Are you one?

[Speaker 5]
I'm still up along.

[Speaker 1]
Oh That's right, that's my bad Rose are you level yeah Then was there a third person No, we're just close All right cliff So you guys are arranged around these tables here and You see claim the spirit of clink begin stalking through his bar. He's stealing paltry goods from patrons and then starts moving on to Mashable goods afterwards, but first every time he steals an item from the From one of the patrons. He's like compelled to go for the most valuable thing and Each time he does for vampires Appear with like really really sharp teeth.

They don't just have like the canines like all of their teeth are kind of like sharp teeth almost And they drain the the patrons these rapes that are seated around the bar And clink is there they appear to drink or try to go after clink as well But clink has been avoiding this by stealing from multiple people at a time They kind of distract them and then you guys are seated there a Charter the one that clink stole while he was there the one that clink came back with When he was a ghost or appeared as a ghost in Tor Bell That Hollow from the The one court that you guys visited or the one house. Sorry the one house that you guys visited earlier That same Charter appears much much larger Right in the center of the bar above that main rug there and There are eight slots for names on it All of them currently playing I need all of you guys to add yourselves to initiative

[Speaker 2]
You said eight slots there were eight slots Thank you

[Speaker 4]
Am I still frightened

[Speaker 3]
Nope

[Speaker 4]
We take that off, please

[Speaker 3]
You can right-click on the little box.

[Speaker 4]
Okay?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Oh Gross When some lose some yeah Jesus their perception is high already.

[Speaker 1]
I believe that we are going to get started Clink don't worry about movement for the for the first round Okay Clink needs to clink has been compelled to choose somebody to steal from I can just Just move wherever I want Mm-hmm. No, I choose your starting location.

[Speaker 3]
Oh Hello welcome, welcome to the bar enjoy I shall do my best Okay, how do I steal Okay Thank you, thank you. Have a good day.

[Speaker 1]
So you have to say What's the most valuable item that Dr. Bush?

[Speaker 2]
Let's see Please pick from my inventory Okay, um, I read it you can't steal something that I'm holding right and oh What? Okay, never mind Then I would gander either my toolkit or my staff either or those would be the most Valuable No, I'm holding It's Yeah You probably like shakes her hand does some stuff and then just he has her staff It really is just kind of like you see dr.

[Speaker 3]
Bosch a glitch out for a moment Awesome What's a rude host Oh Doctor do you want him to act more or absolutely?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's up to you. You have to do at least one and you get You got to pick up the keep the pace Yeah, I'm just thinking Stuff like put it in your inventory then I'll just do it.

[Speaker 2]
So I don't forget. I don't have it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Do you just do it with it?

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's in place inventory now, yeah Yeah, I Haven't gotten to hit anyone with it yet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh It's ghost touch. All right I Hear I Failed on my thievery check.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you don't actually have to make the check. Oh Okay, then I steal from this guy Is that the last one you're stealing from this round yeah, are you sure I've got time Okay To Jesus That's why I'm saying are you sure there's like several people Right the vampires Up here next to One appears next to clink One appears next to the right here Wait, am I in full health or am I still at the health? I do that.

I did boost you back.

[Speaker 3]
Oh you did.

[Speaker 1]
Okay Two things happen. Dr. Basha your name is added to the charter under the position of magister My magister That's correct They're floating they could be rearranged but you're added to the charter as under the position of magister This person their name appears. It's incomprehensible to you guys All except for cling but it gets added to the position of Warden I What is this charter Warranty Clink is added as Warden.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
No, no the guy that clink stole from Okay, that's ominous and not at all scary The grab Oh Crap wait, no, no, that shouldn't be a penalty. It doesn't feel so anyways That is it's turn we have the other one. Hey, we got Dr. Basha Now Good I Can't spend another action to wrap with the target. I heard you did that Jesus Dr. Basha upon going unconscious her name is removed Is or they Pardon oh dear. That's ominous Not her sorry, no, please This one just whatever to clink them I spent two actions all of those that sucks Gee, oh, no You can't you're not allowed to kill him again film again No What happened third times the charm?

[Speaker 3]
No You have to have any reactions to get anything I have counterthought that's what I have Just click at this point is pretty bad.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I have anything that I can use The aura thing because he's too far away

[Speaker 1]
Oh

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I'm sorry I was a little spaced out counting my knitting stitches Yes, I couldn't use This for Bacha

[Speaker 2]
Thank you That's the player talking

[Speaker 4]
So Basha takes four less damage Whack that I'd like to get dragged for some reason Yeah, I don't know It must have moved me over there because I used a melee strike It's set on combat turn so I can't move back.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Thank you, I don't know what happened that week what the fuck what did it move? Where is Meryl right now All righty Yeah, so it was the the one on the bottom is the one that hit Dr. Basha, that's probably the confusion was the other one had to go over and Go tackling First oh I see that and they said my dudes can't really be great Okay, I gotta go unfortunately, oh Do you have you have like a couple more minutes?

[Speaker 6]
I have no more minutes.

[Speaker 1]
Unfortunately, I Have to go Already hope you guys If anybody has additional characters that are in V for unlock or Whatever area yeah Yeah, and you would like to bring them in okay Okay, awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Cool You Know what comes close to leveling why not? How bad is clink I can't tell Oh She oh She's unconscious and come on has he up healing I'll bring her then That's negative He hasn't one dead healing benefits. I'm gonna cost a two-action harm on clink Oh Right blanket Blanket healing will be no good Which then gives me one action left I will cast shield Is the stealing count as a negative like an attack because if I bring Minaya Then she can cast sanctuary on the nerd Oh It's an excellent question, I haven't thought of that Great options options, you know, I'll flip a coin.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah another character.

[Speaker 4]
Just go ahead and put them by a barstool All right, Tyrona appears at the bottom of the stairs Having cut actually come downstairs going. Hey, somebody said there's a party I Make sure you sit at the bottom of the stairs Okay Stealing would not count as a hostile action. Oh good then I can take Minaya and put Sanctuary on Clink so despite the thievery doesn't die Meryl Meryl moves over next to this vampire And puts her hand on its shoulder Casts.

Oh what?

[Speaker 6]
Some kind of error Can you move me to a barstool James?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, there we go So So Meryl puts her hand on the vampire's shoulder and casts lay on hands and then says I Think what? What is it saying critical failure? Well, she was gonna say something cool about I think you find a different bar to drink in but

[Speaker 1]
You only have a plus three and intimidate

[Speaker 4]
Yeah No

[Speaker 1]
So that I have to make so go ahead and roll your damage for the lay on hands and If you do that, it needs to do I know but it needs that while you're targeting him

[Speaker 4]
Then I guess okay, then he'll automatically do it

[Speaker 1]
It gives me a button to do it

[Speaker 4]
Can I have a bonus to to intimidate because of the lay on hands

[Speaker 1]
Not one that's gonna undo that I

[Speaker 4]
Don't understand why it was a critical failure. I rolled a three. I rolled a six.

[Speaker 5]
It's ten less than the DC.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I Assumed it was critical failure.

[Speaker 1]
It's a one Oh Okay, that explains it Now if you wanted to you could have done the shield raise move attack and then the lay on hands If you let me do that, then I'll Yeah, the intimidate wasn't gonna succeed. Anyways, I hope I don't know if you can roll that high enough for these guys I'm also just trying to remind you about it And then dr.

[Speaker 2]
Bosch a girl Awesome cool, but they're going to chug a potion Cool that will be one action and then take just a Couple steps away for oh, I can't move It's still Meryl's turn so I cannot oh, sorry Sorry All right, let's do that just step a little bit away And then Actually, you know what I shouldn't step away I should help flank there we go And yes, and then I will Let's see Then 30 feet. All right, we'll cast electric lightning since I'm out of my leveled spells Electrovert, sorry See there we go And cast Yes, sorry It's not very good That will be my turn First we are going to Cast sanctuary and clink so it doesn't die. Oh, thank you She Does like him good friends Birds of a feather and all that.

Mm-hmm Plus two two damage rolls, so that's going to go Meryl thank you. You're most welcome.

[Speaker 3]
And that is all my actions for the turn Rose Well, wow Okay, well, I guess we'll just stab since they're right there Cool ah, I don't want to hit clink with a ghost bomb.

[Speaker 1]
I Mean these aren't ghosts.

[Speaker 3]
I don't want to hit Yes, okay Well what I can do I can prepare a versatile I can prepare something Yeah, it's fine I'll figure it out next time If you have an action left you could still do that Yeah It's just reading if I can Use one action to do a versatile alchemy first of all I Think you have it quick vial. Yes. Okay.

Okay. Okay Then I will I will Let's throw good old-fashioned Light Okay, oh it's not gonna go oh It's not my turn Oh Sorry, it's my mistake. No here try now Okay, probably not gonna happen.

We'll see. Maybe I'm lucky. No Now I've done everything failed That was rough Yeah, it's all good.

[Speaker 4]
All right, I wrote up all right, I'm gonna do a Reaction Oh, it's gonna be centered on a clink Yeah, I Believe an emanation comes from yourself The emanation is basically it's like a burst outwards from you.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay All right, but I don't get that vampire over there just these three Oh Rip off the ghosts Trying to not get stolen from.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think that's gonna kill the vampires if you want I mean, it's not gonna kill them, but it'll wanna damage It will it should they're undead.

[Speaker 3]
Okay Rip clink Oh, yeah, just click have to make a save yes Hopefully I have not enraged all of the ghosts no, no the ghost kind don't know what happened what's happening Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, they're very limited awareness right now.

[Speaker 3]
I Steal from CC Do you want me to make the check?

[Speaker 1]
Make the check No, just remember it's split up among your whoever the vampires are targeting is split up among your card like the people that you steal from Yeah Anyway, I steal from CC.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah I have five gold which is worth more than my scroll of heal But I think in this instance the scroll of heal is more valuable I did specify monetary value earlier.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like I'm obligated to to stick with that Get a coin toss for five gold.

[Speaker 3]
You have to yoink it All right, and then oh He'll wander over here and take from this patron And we get a steal from at least one more each round Okay, so he'll yeah. Okay, so I need yeah one more He steals from this guy and then Steal from this guy and assuming stealing takes Oh My god, I was hoping for that one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, these ghosts are loaded.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus the ghosts are cells, all right, so Dr. Bosch didn't actually go unconscious. So dr. Bosch is still in the Is still ominous thing Yeah CC gets added to the Charter under probably Treasury didn't what was just stolen from him And then there's two other names There's two other names that go in counselor and in Alderman no close Counselor and Emissary or sorry.

No counselor and Viceroy and vice what? Vice Roy and Warden is still up there. So right now for the names our field.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's half Our clink is at the end of your turn Do I have any more people to steal from any more actions or am I good?

[Speaker 1]
No, I think I think it will go up to three Okay I think actually I'll move And then it resets for the number of people you need to steal from okay, so next turn it'll be yeah Remembering, of course with everybody if you don't steal from people the vampires just go for you.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah You've just doomed my penguin He knows already doomed and he knew it.

[Speaker 3]
I wanted to take one on the roster

[Speaker 2]
I Checks out

[Speaker 5]
Look if he hits level 2 he can become a ghost as well

[Speaker 1]
Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Yeah And then we'll just have to get any other bird players to die become ghosts and then when we don't know When we do otters bird session, it'll be ghost birds

[Speaker 7]
No

[Speaker 1]
Who's grappling home the warden disappears

Oh That was two actions And I Goodbye Yay, I'm going to die You dying you don't have blue No, he's it's he's barely saved my life Shit CC just like this on the plus side if you survive this you'll have so much XP Oh If I survive it's doubled, yeah true I'm out of spell slots.

[Speaker 5]
Anyway, I wasn't gonna do much Dr. Basha, it's my turn.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 2]
Oh That's wondering how I missed everyone going okay, that was that's just me being attacked that's fine you are in fact being attacked How old Could you not That depends on whether Merrill has a reaction, oh, yes Sorry, we do it over there.

[Speaker 1]
Yes From the heart it's there Yeah, I can see 1d 8 plus 3 plus 2 heart.

[Speaker 4]
Very good. Okay. Oh I see.

Okay Yeah, I'm wondering whether it's worth it to cast this What you're looking at lay on hands Infectious enthusiasm that is a to action. Oh, okay I'll just attempt to smack it again. Nope.

That's all right How do you get There it is, that's my they need your help good timing I Am I need to reroll my initiative?

[Speaker 1]
I can't remember what your initiative was. Probably.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
All right Cool we're going to spend another action charging Chanting another health potion Oh How did clink get a 40 on initiative That's And all other moments Okay Okay, well there isn't Quite a lot. I will do except not being hit so what We're just going to chug another potion so I don't get too down And then we can fight next round Wait is clink still like sanctuary. Yes You should okay It's less than a whole minute and then they cast this And that is the end of my turn Here we go Awesome she's going to move over here so she can get the most amount of people Um Then cast bless Let me apply that to Oh wait, I meant to move My terrible bird as you put it a little bit away since they can't do anything right now Can you just drag them to like one of these barrels up here? Up, so they're away.

Thank you Um So that should be blessed and that's two actions Yeah, let me move downwards a bit to see if I can get more people nope cannot This is the extent I can move to There use bless to there we go plus plus that's my turn I lose Right I'm going to pop a vial in your mouth Think I can do that with one action.

[Speaker 3]
It's not a well.

[Speaker 6]
Do you have a quick draw? I have quick alchemy I Guess you could quick alchemy and make it and then it would be in your hand.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah That's what I planned to do. I planned on using a vial to make the health.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's true.

[Speaker 3]
Okay So get get healed You kind soul It's gonna cost you do you want to roll the d6 or do you want me to I'll do it Easy, let's go. Oh, yeah, I'm glad you did it because I probably would have rolled you a one Does DC's name go back On the list This is name does not go back. Oh I'm gonna steal from you again Oh Sorry Is the best encounter ever created in the history of splendid earth, this is this is my To Oh Oh, I'll throw a healing vial at this dude, oh Okay, I Think the healing vial will heal him.

Oh Will it?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. The only thing that damages undead is the heal spell.

[Speaker 3]
I'm kidding. I don't do that I threw a different bomb at him instead. I Bro, what was I gonna do?

[Speaker 6]
Wish I had teakwood. Teakwood has a cool spell or a cool potion for this.

[Speaker 3]
Oh Oh, I have to Actually, sorry. Um I'm actually Find the button to roll the damage. I'm gonna just Roll it and There it takes five splash damage Or no, it takes one splash damage.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry Yeah, did you also the thing that lets you redirect splash damage like a target?

[Speaker 3]
No That's fine. That is a specific bomber trait and I took surgeon, right?

[Speaker 1]
All right, and then the ghost take no damage because they have resistance cool.

[Speaker 3]
Hell. Yeah, I know what I'm doing All right, and that is return Where is clink He is a slowing orb.

[Speaker 4]
Yes Okay, I'm gonna move away from him because if he steals from me, I'm gonna kill him You don't want to be one of his emissaries That is the catch-up for Otto Okay, that is not new information that happened literally right as I left James can you remind me how operands free works in this new system?

[Speaker 1]
Oh you get a Same thing you shoot people. There's no reload to it. It has a It Doesn't shoot spells This one the way it currently works is it shoots just magical projectiles which are cold iron Okay, we're gonna die, right?

It deals Three splash damage and does persistent damage as well. Oh So be very very careful at who you shoot Yeah, I'm not gonna use it first because this black Who'd you shoot?

[Speaker 4]
This vampire. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I See primal spell attack. What'd you do? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Realize it wasn't a pop-up baseball All right, so that's a two I'll also cast Last field. Oh, no, I'm moved.

[Speaker 1]
Never mind Like what you steal from over here Oh Oh Yeah Deal from this guy Let's see what he's got He's still wouldn't be the snakes So It's added to the position of Warden Can't clink attack.

[Speaker 4]
No, okay. That's what I thought. I have a question.

Yeah Clink is compelled to steal from one creature. Can he choose to steal for more?

[Speaker 1]
He can Yeah, he has to do it. He has to do one more each round until it resets them so it resets to one like

[Speaker 3]
honestly Just You just steal

[Speaker 1]
Another name appears with It was gonna be general

[Speaker 3]
Would Merrill kill clink If he stole from her No, okay cool

[Speaker 4]
The thing is that the most valuable thing Kairona has is Oberon's wreath and it is literally priceless No, Merrill, um, yeah, I was saying that's why Kairona would kill him

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that makes sense, that's fine. Yeah, I Don't know how much deep that's when he'd give it back but How much does a moonlit spell gun work?

[Speaker 4]
Seven seven gold.

[Speaker 1]
So there's a dagger pistol breastplate. Those are both for eight gold pieces Take the dagger, but no Val Robin is worth a hundred ten gold pieces. I will I Damaged you With what's up You can steal from Dr. Bostic Wait, no, you can't I'm sorry Decisions decisions is really difficult.

[Speaker 3]
You can't steal from your other bird friend if needs must Oh Okay, well You can steal from Kloofy.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll steal from Kloofy because I don't want to want to take I mean, I've got I've got Two guns and a bomb that I could use.

[Speaker 3]
I think it has to be the most valuable item though I don't think no that I mean that I could use I mean, are you okay with that?

[Speaker 4]
As long as I get it back.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, if you depossess it, he'll give it back to you Okay, I'm gonna paw, but he'll give it back to you All right. Okay, so I'd like your soul, please And then can I can I move afterwards I

[Speaker 1]
Think that definitely puts up Merrill in the position of general You can move next to another you can move again if you're moving next to somebody that you're stealing from

[Speaker 3]
Okay Because I think I thought was three steals so I'm my turn is done

[Speaker 1]
What are we stealing from Kloofy

[Speaker 3]
I already did I did the two bottom ones, didn't I? I thought I did the two bottom ones Did I only do one from the bottom?

[Speaker 1]
You said you did yeah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You stole from Merrill.

[Speaker 5]
So that's that's what you got to hand back Then go to CC Now are these vampires consuming the ghosts?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah Yeah, it's why Klink is moving around because he wants to keep his stuff I'll try and get them a second then so they can't ingest anything.

[Speaker 1]
I'll get these two to do a fort save The all that's left is the treasure and ruler positions Flint can't choose to put his own name on there for The other guy just gets moved I'm scrolling down now. I gotta make these Jesus Christ, that one is not over then he just blows a heap of ash at them Sickened which one it sort of failed now the top one And I'll spend my last action standing up Can't willingly ingest anything. That's pretty clever.

Oh, I get cursed by using my cursebound spell Yeah, that's I'm done, thank you This one he's just gotta go down here Move Attack and grab I think they have physical resistance.

[Speaker 4]
All right, that's his turn Which I'm clicking on these guys one at a time Dr. Basha Oh shit Basha takes four less damage and I get to smack this guy Very good.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thank you. I missed but Okay, so those were two attacks against me No, it was an attack and then a grab But you're successful, which means I get to use this.

[Speaker 1]
Oh What is what is fast you would buy? Oh, I regained hit points at the beginning Don't you dare? Come on I get see I gotta see if it did it automatically or not.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure Oh Because I'm going to drink the blood Full of tasty Let's check Take an extra time for damage Healing oh I see. Okay. Give me a second.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no, you took no you just took four Okay, wait, hold on I messed up the numbers ignore me how much HP was I on before I Have no idea now Okay, I was on nine or damage was I Added the effect French attributed certain like I could just add that to someone.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, so it would have been eight Okay, okay all this all this Wow I'll use shield block next time I can hit So just you know, we're not gonna become trained one. Oh Then I can use shield block cool awesome That's from an attack, ah This is not an attack.

[Speaker 1]
Nope. You are restrained. So it's automatic

[Speaker 2]
Hey, hey, all right

[Speaker 1]
Come back this guy has to attack You're old gonna try to get this guy over the damage ghost is destroyed I Think was Kongroo's gratitude

[Speaker 3]
No, oh that was my favorite one

[Speaker 1]
Now they're part of them your friends just gotta go for This one's good to go Hmm this one's going for a player character Okay, maybe 50 yeah, yeah, I could get one attack on No, I have an action hey Jesus Christ

[Speaker 3]
Is Marilyn conscious I don't know maybe Nova

[Speaker 6]
Let's see, who's our biggest threat right now? Um, I mean me my name. Oh I'll go for the guy that just hit This one I'm gonna do a spell strike Phone strike Chew and then I'm gonna blast him with a scorching

[Speaker 1]
Oh

[Speaker 6]
And then I'm gonna cast Horse bang me max damage

[Speaker 1]
Is at the end of your turn yes, so that means

[Speaker 6]
Okay Shit there she is in the middle of the floor

[Speaker 3]
Well, I guess I'm just I can do 60 feet, okay Okay No Oh No, cuz we technically have five minutes No How's that See

[Speaker 6]
You didn't have it no you had it targeted it's not flanked to arranged attack

[Speaker 3]
You're like protect people I could only do one spell

[Speaker 4]
I really don't know what to do

[Speaker 3]
Live yeah, I just got three more names.

[Speaker 2]
All right fine I'm gonna sort of grapple people If you grab somebody who's grabbed is off guard to all attacks Need a free hand to grapple low I know has Been abandoned Well In order to escape I'd have to make like an athletics on acrobatic chat, correct I believe the escape you just attack them with your unarmed strike I'm I'll miss You can use acrobatics instead What's all good? I'll just let's see. Well now I've got my versatile vials left So we are just going to chug them Merrill just died Merrill So I left yeah I have seven HP and no weapon And I mean, yeah I'll just use all three of my verse.

Oh sweet. I'll just use all three of my versatile vials to heal myself Of course too good to be true And so I have enough health to not die next time they bite me. That will be my turn And then We're gonna pull a cool thing and then Cast Oh No, click you're in the aura The left a bit Oh What's the Well, didn't you what sanctuary is that just from like melee or is that from all damage it's from being attacked So someone is purposely trying to hurt you.

Oh Okay, well This will work both as a heel and trying to um, I guess fight the vampires slightly Actually, you know what? I can just do this as a heel since I don't think that fighting the vampires is going to work. So we'll just Good.

Okay fair enough bar She'll hit point restored by eight, okay, you know versus living Well healing Sick Now I'll just do the two action one And then I shall use the last action. Who else is here to fight? Who's on board I don't know Aaron is leaving right?

I said leave not leave She might be busy It's true All right, who does melee attacks who would benefit from stoke the heart or should I just abscond Actually, you know what only me Yes Rose sometimes does melee Okay Okay All right, here you go then Rose If the other melee folks aren't going to take it, please take stoke the heart I don't think there's any other melee folks on the board. Yeah To damage If it's damage rolls Completely Gets all the names of the list or chooses to Yeah Okay, then very sorry Rose you might want to tick yourself off since it's damage wait No, you can benefit from damage. Keep it and Then restored spirit and then we're done with my turn Rose

[Speaker 3]
You better steal from me next I want to be on this stupid thing

[Speaker 1]
This is how you sneaking cooperation between your characters, this is the way to do it

[Speaker 3]
Does anybody need healing We're gonna be

[Speaker 2]
You can heal CC

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, then your next character can steal from him again

[Speaker 3]
You're immune from battle, but so I'll give you I'll just give you a vial no my clothes. Oh, there he goes Oh There there oh Wait, whoops. That's not what I meant to do Sorry, give me a moment.

I messed up that doesn't exist. I meant to do this one Since you're immune to my battle medicines There you go, thanks I'll just like toss it in your mouth and we'll call it good And Then I guess I'll just stab this guy I'll try to Yeah What do you mean it doesn't do any damage I think vampires need silver My fork is silver I If you want me to have it on there I

[Speaker 2]
Didn't know if I could so I did Well, there you go for the funny as you can

[Speaker 5]
I

[Speaker 1]
Think just be wrapping this up now. So blink I think is about to wrap this up. Yeah I think a message.

I heard it. Yeah. Yeah, you understand what I said, dude.

[Speaker 7]
I Think so. Yeah

[Speaker 3]
Well, but I really want your name on my list

[Speaker 2]
But you don't have anything Don't steal from an eye

[Speaker 3]
No, I'll steal from this ghost Yep, well the one to the side of me died

[Speaker 1]
Well, the one to the left is also there

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I've got three turns reaction And then that one

[Speaker 1]
There you go

[Speaker 2]
And then that's fun all the names felt or is there one more cuz the other guy died

[Speaker 3]
There should be three

[Speaker 7]
Hey

[Speaker 1]
All right, so with that all the names will be filled does Clint want to write himself in under the ruler position on the Charter Yeah, why not

[Speaker 3]
He'll be ruler

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to swap? Yeah, I think so.

[Speaker 3]
Do you want to swap with one of the Yeah, I'll do the ghost charge one I'll swap it with CC I get what I want He was crossed off as his life Um, I can take off Merrill if Merrill doesn't want to be on there If she is anti undead, okay, I'll take Merrill off and I can swap it with that guy And you get your sword back I mean you two are gonna get your stuff back either way Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I thought it was gone.

[Speaker 3]
No, it was always temporary and even if he would have given it back My five gold. Yay All right, and then I think I Think dr. Basha is the only one who actually managed to stay on there Your success Do you do you want us?

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to be on there? Well, I don't know the benefits and negatives of not being on there. So like Pros and cons Um You get to be part of Klink's court Sure, why not?

Easier access to the undead it helps with trying to make people not dead.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so then just swap one name Swap Merrill off with this guy All right, and then I have to total some stuff out.

[Speaker 1]
So the Charter Resolves you see a seal appear with The image of a snake with three jaws And as a seal over the Charter itself the Charter then disappears and There is You are back in Klink's regular basement, but there is an additional basement additional steps That go down into the other world What the fuck? Additionally the treasury has been deployed Are the vampires gone or are they just here? The vampires disappear with the items that they eat.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, thank God Give me that XP boss.

[Speaker 1]
Yes That's a start All right, who's who's like level one?

[Speaker 5]
CC granny Agnes I Think that's all of them the other two leveled up. Oh, no.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's just Oh, you know, it's just granny Agnes and CC If I lie, can I have some bonus XP?

[Speaker 1]
What's the what's the level thing? Is it like double the character level or what is the what's the prop for it?

[Speaker 5]
So whatever level you decide the encounter is If The characters are below that they get double XP is whatever the rule is If they're just below so I would say Yeah vampires of With the fast healing and stuff like that.

[Speaker 1]
It feels right What level is Clayton? Clink is to Just carry To at the moment To Say clink is to Roses to as I recall Yep As homebrew you should give CC four times XP Do you want the level five penguin so bad?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah Understandable have a fantastic day.

[Speaker 1]
Oh XP Said auto-assign I clicked it like three times. Whoa. Whoa.

Whoa. No bunch of you are leveling up I'm going to add gold that comes from the Treasury of the past that Flink is now in charge of Wow fucked up and weird and fun, but all that treasure that Clink collected is it now also going into his mini storage? so it's technically in the Treasury, but the Treasury is accessible here if you guys would like to take those out and Distribute them you can and then the gold.

I'm just going to distribute the gold that comes out It was just a flat distribute to everybody on the party Okay, who is Peter?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's a familiar Yes, the bird has a bird familiar I thought it was funny Yeah, I sorry some reason I thought yeah, sorry You stole my ghost staff Okay, I Saw that I was like, oh weird. We did that kid. Let's see and then I have five gold Thank you, no, yeah, I took my book

[Speaker 1]
Dump all these in so folks can look at them at their own leisure

[Speaker 2]
Thank you

[Speaker 3]
Oh Yeah, these are really cool These are so cool Some of these weren't used it was just stuff he'd afforded because none no one else wanted it I think

[Speaker 2]
That's why they were asking for the inventory for the last character that makes sense

[Speaker 1]
All right, so where's shoe did I did I accidentally take away some stuff there should be

[Speaker 2]
It makes sense as well because a lot of these seem to be monk outfits like for monks.

[Speaker 1]
Not a lot of people can use There should be I think there should be six items on here.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh unique Technically there is if you count both of the clay vials.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but both of those came from one guy Oh Hey James

[Speaker 4]
So I just got Blessed armament and I'm trying to add Vitalizing but I don't seem to be able to add it alongside ghost touch

[Speaker 5]
You can only have one You need a plus two potency rune to get two and then plus three for three

[Speaker 3]

[Referee (James)]
All right, so is everybody clear on the objectives for this one even?

[Miijaco]
Um, down that person that got Walia's voice.

[Referee (James)]
That's part of them. So, yeah, oh it's over here. Uh, so Wollyria is still weakened, has not fully recovered her voice, she's just enjoying a little bit of a secondary, a little bit of healing.

She's not at full capacity. And in order to be valid, she needs to be at full capacity. For the moment, supposedly her voice has been given to the military commander of an army.

That's, funnily enough, the one currently headed to Stensil. Peacekeeping. Headed to Silayo's fire.

So, she figures that we could kill two birds with one stone. The objective is not to destroy the army, because that's what's there, and that's not possible. But the objective is to see if you can get this item.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
It's about three days travel away within the Feywild as all goes well. Wollyria is going to, as a figure of good faith, extend a little bit of her power to keep the path stable. But, so long as you stay on the path, you won't be...

As long as you stay on the path, you'll be able to reach your destination. Okay. That's about what they've got for the moment.

Any questions, preparations you want to make? Because I don't know the party composition right now, except for... I have pretty good familiarity with Para's stuff, because we've been playing for about three or four months now.

But I don't know the extent of everybody else's.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I leveled up in Ranger, so I'm a little more martial than I was yesterday. Yeah, I took Warcaster.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, on my level up, I also took Warcaster. It's such a good feat.

[Miijaco]
It is, for classes that do that type thing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I guess my question's more for, like, the party. Um, was Telqua our Ranger, or was that Robin?

[Speaker 3]
That's me. I'm the Ranger.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so we could possibly do some stealthing, um, with Pass Without Trace. That might be a good option, once we get closer.

[Miijaco]
Yeah, that would be a good option. Um, would... I'm trying to read the survival, I mean the exploration thing, and see if anything on my list helps at all.

[Speaker 2]
Not really.

[Miijaco]
Well, maybe survival.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We have the birds, right?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, we followed the birds along the path.

[Miijaco]
Yeah, and once we get closer, we just follow them to the item and take the voice back and bring it back to Elaria.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Wow, you make it sound so easy.

[Miijaco]
Yeah, I'm keeping the bare bones of the plan simple. We can adjust as we go along.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, is there anything we want to do before we actually, like, head out and leave, or...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, um, I took half an hour to beg, borrow, and gather some incense and re-summon my familiar.

[Miijaco]
Um, wait, I don't need the only one with the seed if I summon one, so I won't do that. Well, other than Robin. So I won't do that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think I want to use, um, everyone is not at full health, right?

[Speaker 3]
I'm at full health.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm not.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you took more damage than I did.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, how low are you?

[Miijaco]
Out of 85, I'm at 76.

[Speaker 4]
Your low health is the same as my highest health. Yeah. Paladins, man.

[Miijaco]
Hey, I can put some way in hands into myself and heal the rest of the way if that's what you think would be best.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, I'm trying to count how much healing I would get out of Prayer of Healing. Probably a little too much. Uh, it's only 2d8 plus spellcasting modifier, so I don't know, actually.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, how much did you guys have again? I'm missing 9.

[Speaker 4]
I'm missing a lot more than 9.

[Speaker 3]
I'm fine. Don't log on me.

[Speaker 4]
I'm 34 down.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so I think I have, um, something I can use. Let me just find it here. Yeah, I have Preserve Life, which lets me do a number of hit points equal to 5 times my cleric level.

[Miijaco]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Which is 60, um, HP.

[Speaker 8]
So that would be, um, both me and, um, um, I am blanking on your name. Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, Kyrona. Up to full and then 6 extra for Majako.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I can live with that indeed. Okay. Oh, it's 62.

I didn't know that added to it.

[Referee (James)]
Anybody else having issues with Boundary Server?

[Miijaco]
Nope. A little bit. It keeps on telling me I'm disconnecting and reconnecting.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I haven't had issues with it.

[Miijaco]
Me either.

[Referee (James)]
I had to reload my thing. I tried to go to the website. It wouldn't let me, uh, it wouldn't let me in the website.

[Miijaco]
Well, we are in the central part of the US expecting a lot of bad weather soon.

[Speaker 4]
North central? Middle central? Or south central?

[Referee (James)]
Everything seems- At least. Thanks.

[Speaker 4]
I'm in the middle of Wisconsin, so- Hey!

[Miijaco]
A fellow Wisconsinite!

[Speaker 4]
Hey!

[Speaker 3]
Hey, I'm loving the idea of you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I am also not near anyone. I am over in the Pacific Northwest.

[Speaker 4]
I have a friend in Seattle.

[Miijaco]
Well, at least we're doing better than a friend of mine that lives in Canada. Indeed.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so, uh, you guys are what? Right now you're discussing how to heal best? Rescuers of Action, if you prefer?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, yeah, we were just healing up. Um, I used my Preserve Life, so.

[Speaker 4]
So how much are each of us getting?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So I was 20 down.

[Miijaco]
I believe we came up with everyone's full but me and I'm only one from max.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, um, after I take my health, there's 42 left over. You said you needed 36, yeah?

[Speaker 4]
34.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
34? So that actually left 8 left over. Then I would be- Yeah, so I think that- Yeah.

So that's good.

[Speaker 4]
Anyways. Everybody's awesome.

[Miijaco]
I think we're going to attempt to follow the road. Follow the birds and then once we get closer, sneak.

[Speaker 3]
Sounds like a plan.

[Speaker 4]
Makes sense.

[Miijaco]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want to say hi to us? Are we, um, I remember we were discussing, are we going to be using- going to be traveling long enough to be using the Exploration?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, it's about three days travel away.

[Speaker 4]
Very easy then.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Uh, Corona, I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last thing you said.

[Speaker 4]
I just said okay.

[Referee (James)]
My, my, I guess probably right at the beginning of it, like the end of the sentence. Longer sentence. Yeah, all right, so the DC for this part of the Feywild is 20.

You guys do have a little bit of help lowering the DC. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, and this is a survival check or something?

[Referee (James)]
This is the Exploration that you guys had access to last evening.

[Speaker 4]
Which was just raw ability?

[Referee (James)]
No, the stuff you guys, last night was, uh, picked and rolled. Did a total- Oh, yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
This is the, the thing you did to do the, um, to give everybody the Devil's Sight.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, I'm gonna stick with Cook. Um, I was trying to remember what it was that we rolled. And that was no skill bonuses, just ability.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I don't think that was going to be Exploration.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, no, no, no, so the reason, the reason you used ability for that was have proficiency in books. Ah, yes, okay.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to, this time, try Tracker. What does your Tracker give you, incidentally? Oh.

Mine allows me to move twice as fast while tracking. If that's, you know. Give me guidance.

Please.

[Miijaco]
Mine is, it gives me the option to do a full damage on a Smite, or full healing on something, my choice.

[Referee (James)]
So, uh, abilities and spells and stuff like that that don't accept the application of the effect. I'll just- Aren't going to, aren't going to apply to- What that means is, if you just have, like, a guidance, or, like, an enhance ability or something like that, for the sake of, uh, an ability, or, or, if it's basically not permanent, or doesn't have a really long duration, it's not going to add to the challenge.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Well, I only could. Okay, you're the boss.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm gonna do what I did last time with, uh, Insight Entertainment.

[Miijaco]
What do I roll for Tracker? Uh, one roll?

[Speaker 3]
Oh. And can only one person be on one roll, I assume?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, no, only one person can be on one roll. Uh, it doesn't really double up the success. It doesn't count for- What basically happens is, it doesn't count for a success.

If you both double up on the roll. Okay. But you still get the other better.

[Miijaco]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Uh-huh.

[Miijaco]
I didn't realize someone was already doing Tracker, but- Oh. What do I roll for Tracker?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, shouldn't you suggest- The question is, my friend, what will you roll for Tracker? I need you to suggest something to me.

[Miijaco]
Uh, Survival, to keep an eye on where those birds are flying.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Normal roll.

[Referee (James)]
Kara, you said you're going with Entertainment?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes. Uh, and Kyrona, don't forget you can reuse, um, or redo your roll with, uh, Rations. Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 3]
I guess I'll go with Vanga.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's much better. Hell yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Those things come in so clutch.

[Referee (James)]
How the hell do I get people to eat Rations? The food looks lovely. Nobody wants to eat bread.

Aha! Alrighty. So that's three successes already.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, and I'll do Vanguard, uh, Perception, I think, because I'm keeping out for Threats and, uh, all that stuff.

[Referee (James)]
That's good to me.

[Speaker 3]
Cheers. Okay. And does my Survival- does it apply to this?

Uh, yeah, it does, I just think. Detecting something in Natural Terrain, which is what we want, so. I can use that if I want to.

We'll see how we evolve this. Oh, good. I probably don't need it.

Survival- did I say this?

[Speaker 2]
Nice.

[Miijaco]
Cool.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so you guys get, uh, benefits of a Hardy Rest. You are not going to suffer any encounters on the way.

[Miijaco]
Birds lead you forward. Hardy Rest means a long rest? No.

I need to read that section of this, do you?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, is that like a short rest? I think. Maybe, I don't know.

Hardy Rest. Uh, Travel? Is that part of the, uh, same Exploration handbill?

[Speaker 9]
Oh, I see. I know the definition of Hardy Rest is actually- Hardy Rest basically- Ah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
It is.

[Speaker 9]
It is. Oh, it is.

[Speaker 3]
So we have to sort out a Hardy Rest. Okay. Ah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I dropped it in the Foundry chat.

[Referee (James)]
Nice, thank you so much.

[Speaker 9]
At least we got a Head Dive and Class Dive.

[Speaker 3]
Well, yeah. Head Dive and Class Dive, so it's like a one-third long rest, okay. One Head Dive or Class Head Dive, one-third long rest.

Ah, here we go, Hardy Rest. So we just get an extra Head Dive back if we have expended a number. I don't think we've expended any Head Dive, so I don't think it matters.

[Referee (James)]
Or, what's my card? Um.

[Speaker 3]
Class Dive?

[Referee (James)]
Well, hold on a second. First, you would have had to- unless you were healed back to full, you would have had to spend Head Dive. He wasn't damaged.

He wasn't damaged.

[Speaker 3]
I wasn't damaged. Yeah, no, I got healed back from the earlier- There you go. So I didn't need to use it as anything, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so if you used- also, obviously- So do we get Class Dive back from the Hardy Rest? Class Dive back, you have to get- you have to choose to get it back at a Head Dive.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. I can do that, because I haven't expended any Head Dive, so getting one of my Survival Dives back would be nice.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, or I guess two per evening.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. How many evenings have we had Hardy Rests in? Two?

[Referee (James)]
It's a three-day journey, so I guess three. You guys would have had that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Okay, that would be all my Survival Dives back. But we don't get our spells back until we rest somewhere else, I assume.

[Referee (James)]
I think the document also explains that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So, let's see. Spells are unrecovered, yeah.

Um... Go ahead. Yeah, I assume we- yeah, while we're traveling, we have to get the spells back.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, no, that's not what it says. Go to the section that says Recovering Spell Slots on- We get half our level- Oh, I see. He gets a little bit more specifically.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Ranger. Yeah, Druid's, Ranger's, and other Palm of the Spark as we regain our Level Spell Slots. Combined level.

Okay, no greater than first level Palm of the Long Rest. So we did technically Long Rest while we were traveling, because I'm just trying to distinguish the difference between a Hardy Rest and a Long Rest. Is there a difference?

Or are they both the same thing?

[Referee (James)]
Hardy Rest is just a condition.

[Speaker 3]
That's applied to Long Rest. Oh, man, it's very- yeah. It's like having a good rest versus a not-so-good rest.

You're still resting the same amount of time, but they- it's about quality rather than quantity.

[Referee (James)]
By the way, you guys really got to enjoy the outdoors while you were out here. Nothing went wrong. Nothing went poorly.

The food was good. The spirits were better. And nobody woke up as we're back.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay. And some of the travel effects do only happen on a Hardy Rest.

[Speaker 3]
Right, I see. So, okay, so I get some of my spells back. Does this happen once or twice since we've rested not all days while traveling?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, I think- so your character level is like at least eight at this point.

[Speaker 3]
Eight.

[Referee (James)]
I can't imagine that you would have any Expended Spell Slots not recovered during- Yeah, chances are I've recovered them all because I only- I didn't use all my spells and it's just a couple of second levels- I don't know if you marked them down or not, um, but just- Yeah, I marked them down. It's three days and your character level is eight, so unless you have like 48 Spell Slots, you're out.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I doubt- yeah, I'd probably get all my spells back.

[Referee (James)]
Someone who's like three, so I'm pretty sure- Yeah.

[Miijaco]
Would me as a Divine Caster get two third level slots back? I probably wouldn't.

[Speaker 3]
I can't remember because I don't know if there isn't half a level upon cleaning the long list, so- Let's see who's level.

[Miijaco]
Majako is currently level nine. I'm just wondering if we took one long rest or multiple.

[Referee (James)]
You were traveling for three days. Did you choose not to travel for those three days?

[Miijaco]
I got the other spell slot back.

[Speaker 3]
So half your spell level three times. That's the one I'm reading.

[Miijaco]
Oh, spell level?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, your level, character level. So half of that, so that would be four, I think, or four and a half, so- Yeah, so I'm good. Thing, and you can do that three times, so- Yeah, I just was missing my two level threes.

Yeah, that sounds about right, so yeah, you'd get them back over the two days.

[Miijaco]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think all spell casters are the one that would suffer more than half spell casters, really, because we just don't have as many spells. I think you suffer on hit dice and stuff like that more, because, you know, you're more likely to spend them. I don't know.

Okay, so I am fully rested and ready to go, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so you guys come across a rather impressive valley that mimics the topography that you are entering. In this place, the sun is almost set on the horizon. It's still awash with golden light.

There is a profoundly large gate at the other side of the tree that is probably, at least from your perspective, probably at least a mile or two in diameter. It is itself awash with golden light and sort of magnifying us, let's say, coming from the turpentine, proper direction, and then they turn down to look at your left on the overlook that you will be coming. And you can see where a small army has been camped out.

I guess not a small army, but rather substantially sized army.

[Speaker 4]
Is this because I said it could be worse?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it can always be worse.

[Speaker 4]
I was just told not to say that yesterday. You're not allowed to say it.

[Miijaco]
Yeah, no, no.

[Speaker 3]
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

[Miijaco]
So how do we get in there? Or to the thing?

[Speaker 3]
Well, first we need to find out exactly where in the camp they're holding the, um, what's it called? The voice, yes. And, well, birds are not terribly out of place here.

Perhaps I can, one of the birds can help figure that out because I can cast a spell to see through its eyes, so. Though you have your familiar as well. Can you see through it?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I can have her turn invisible and follow the birds.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We can double up, and if you can communicate with them remotely then. But once we find out where it is, then we can sneak in.

[Miijaco]
Sounds like a reasonable strategy.

[Speaker 3]
I think it's part of, uh, primate awareness. Um, I can speak with an animal and with the birds and tell them what the plan is. And then use beast syncs, uh, to see into one of their eyes and, uh, and give them a smile.

Um, so I can see what they see. And hopefully we can find out exactly where the voice is.

[Referee (James)]
All right, solid plan.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. Birds, they don't use a spell slot because they'll get a cousin once each day, so. Fun times.

Uh, does this require concentration or not? I don't know if any of this does. Oh yeah, beast syncs does.

And that lasts an hour, so. So, uh, so we're staying somewhere hidden from them, you know, a decent distance outside the camp. Actually, we don't want to get caught while they're scouting.

[Referee (James)]
No, you're going to be fine. So, the birds fly over the camp. There looks to be about 16 units here, plus reserves.

They are approximately, let's see here, six archer units, uh, another eight, uh, infantry units, and then 10, or sorry, two, uh, T-Jendo, which are Balistae.

[Speaker 9]
Balistas, is that what they're called?

[Speaker 3]
Balistae, yeah. Those big, uh, shooters.

[Referee (James)]
Yep. Well, they look like them. They're sort of like those, except they're, like, turreted and on wheels.

They're turreted?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. They can, yeah, rotate them.

[Referee (James)]
They have full rotation.

[Speaker 4]
I thought you meant, as in, they have turret.

[Referee (James)]
It's like a second smaller Balista on top of it.

[Speaker 4]
Or something.

[Referee (James)]
I'm going to write that down.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
A gun that shoots guns.

[Speaker 9]
What about a turret that shoots smaller turrets?

[Speaker 3]
That's very American.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Guns have legs!

[Referee (James)]
All right, into the 3D printer it goes. The Liberator is getting an upgrade. Let's see here.

Yeah, so they go about the camp. There is one particularly large camp that the birds are guessing is probably the main big guy's tent. There are two guards posted outside of it.

It has an overlook over the rest of the camp, and it's kind of, like, pressed up against a cliff wall.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Is the overlook on the cliff wall? No, it's not falling across the cliff wall, but...

[Speaker 7]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, fair enough, because I can't quite... Um... Yeah, we'll have to visualise in that.

Okay, so... See how good an artist you are. Uh, so this is...

This is not going to be artistically... This... Okay, so that's a plane.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, no. There you go. Oh, okay.

We're looking top down. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Then this little valley nook. I see. I see, I see.

Is that part of the cliff?

[Referee (James)]
There is a pathway leading up.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
And pressed up against the cliff is the commander's tent.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
So we've got these... Close on either side, we've got this, uh, leads that's going upwards, but it doesn't go all the way up the cliff. I imagine it goes part way up, and then on top of that is the commander's tent.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Referee (James)]
It's not on the cliff. It is on the side of the cliff.

[Speaker 2]
Not...

[Referee (James)]
Might also be. It is hugging the cliff.

[Speaker 4]
It is up against the cliff. It is not upon the cliff.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

Yeah, that's what I was saying. Yeah. Okay, so this might mean by overlock, yeah, it's...

[Speaker 2]
Okay. How long would it take us to get to the top of the cliff behind the tent? Do we have a way of dropping down without splattering?

I mean, do we have fifth floor? That's what I'm asking. Um, could we have taken a few of those white feathers with us?

[Referee (James)]
I think you guys still had five left. We do.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, interesting. So we could use rope. We'll go down into that commander area, grab the thing, which way is this?

[Speaker 3]
Like, we're in a valley, right? So which way is the sun facing? I just want to know if the light, if the sun is coming from the north and, and like this area would be in shadow, or coming from the opposite direction and this area would be in shadow.

[Speaker 2]
Are there some light here?

[Speaker 7]
I'm just wondering if there's any dim light across the side of the main, on this side, basically. Because if there's dim light, then I can fly on my own.

[Referee (James)]
The dim light, it would pretty much only be below this, below the ledge on the left, any areas of dense foliage, and any place where the cliff had a little bit of an overhang, I guess. It's where it was being blocked a little.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, right. I don't know. I mean, what time of day is it, incidentally?

[Referee (James)]
It's a fair while. The sun never actually sets here.

[Speaker 3]
Right, yeah. I keep forgetting that.

[Referee (James)]
There are places where it is dimmer than others, and places where it, like, goes full twilight.

[Speaker 7]
But we're in, like, the summer core area, so it's always sunny. Philadelphia.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, right. Well, you guys are currently on the opposite cliff's face.

[Referee (James)]
So, yeah. Do you want your birds to get any more details about the camp? Because right now, I'm just giving you, kind of, like, overview.

[Speaker 3]
Like, all I generally wanted was them to pinpoint where the voice was, but I think we can figure that part out. It's probably in the commander's camp.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I want to know everything they can tell us. Yeah. There's no such thing as too much information.

[Speaker 3]
Right, okay. Sort of them to get themselves killed, because they see danger, you know, fly away.

[Referee (James)]
When seeking the voice, they actually do not detect it in the camp. They detect it as when they were initially looking, oops, hmm, further in this direction.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Miijaco]
I'd say we just go around the camp, then.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, because we only hear for the voice. We don't care about the rest of them right now. I mean, we'll, I'll, like, jot down, like, troop numbers and compositions, and what equipment they have, and la-da-da-da.

You know, it's for the sake of passing on that information, but we're not going to engage their camp, if we can avoid it.

[Referee (James)]
That's it. That's the first little detail, sweeping over the camp. It looks as if the, let's see here, it looks like one of the siege engines is being retrofitted, not with freezing bolts, but with something that looks like black and necrotic in origin.

And also, it also looks, what do you call it? Okay. It looks like what?

Sorry. It looks like a drow, it looks drow in origin, the bolts do. Yeah, so they're retrofitting, they're adding other different bolts, and a slightly modified firing mechanism to account for the difference in length.

And they're oozing, like, this necrotic energy that just kind of sucks in the air around.

[Speaker 2]
Is there context? Is there context that I'm missing here? Not that I'm aware of, maybe.

I've heard about people having had some good, some bad interactions with the drow.

[Referee (James)]
Otter, you could probably give the party a small update on that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So we, oh god, what were we trying to do there? Oh, we were trying to, when we were saving Salile's spire the first time, there were these, like, things that were shooting necromantic energy at the spire that was preventing Salile from coming into being. And so when we went and did that, there was a drow matron who was there, and she agreed to let the spire go if we did a favor for her, which was beating up another drow matron.

[Speaker 4]
Of course.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And then a pit fiend was summoned, and la-di-da, the lady left and abandoned us. So my guess is she'd probably be working to some degree, because she was actively trying to stop Salile from existing.

[Speaker 8]
So that's probably where that's from. Lovely.

[Speaker 4]
So this is probably the drow that you beat up?

[Speaker 8]
Maybe, maybe not, but that would be my guess, yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's at least probably her people. She probably has dealings with them. Though it might be another house that is allied with her.

They have their own, like, messy politics and stuff.

[Speaker 8]
And I do not remember her name.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so the drow house that you guys encountered were, sorry, not House Marta, it was House Cain.

[Speaker 2]
The House of Cain.

[Speaker 7]
It sounds like something out of Command and Conquer, but okay.

[Speaker 4]
I was thinking it sounded like a rock song.

[Referee (James)]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 7]
That sounds like a rock song, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
All of them are. So they claimed that they were beefing with House Marta, and asked for the parties to stop summoning House Marta. But they lied.

They actually summoned the matron of House Craylus, which is the, summoned the matron of House Craylus, who was allied with the party. But the party didn't actually meet her in person, so they didn't recognize her.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so things are all kinds of fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
But we saved her after she died.

[Speaker 4]
I'm sure she feels that that makes up for it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, she lent us some of their troops, so I mean, eh?

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy. Hopefully no hard feelings there.

[Speaker 8]
I mean, we could have left her dead, but we didn't. That should mean something, right? Should.

[Speaker 2]
Anyways, anything especially flammable laying about, or is that all tucked away? Especially flammable if it left in the House of Frost? Yeah, probably not.

[Miijaco]
I was just hoping we'd have, be able to make something go boom on our way through.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe on the way out, perhaps, if we have to make a distraction. You know, setting the supplies on fire is easily a good distraction.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So we go around, take a, well, not take a, grab the voice, come back, and get back to Ulaia as best as we can. Maybe via causing some sort of distraction along the way.

[Speaker 3]
Possibly, yeah. I mean, if we can do some damage to them, that'd be great, but I think we should consider that a secondary objective.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it would be. But yeah, we should just go around this camp and go after that voice. Is there any teleports available?

Is there any what available?

[Miijaco]
Teleports to take us from the bottom cliff face to the top cliff face, I mean, cliff ledge, and we just continue from there.

[Speaker 2]
Alas, I only get one teleport a week. That was a thought, though.

[Speaker 3]
We sure have a flying MacGuffins.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. Can you teleport multiple people into dark, well, I guess if it's not dark on this side, well, I could cast darkness on this side. So I have darkness that I can cast.

If I do a darkness on either side, would that be something that you could teleport people through, or is that not how that thing works?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, can you post, you have the text right in front of you, post it on the foundry.

[Speaker 3]
Are you talking about me or somebody else?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, I thought you had something you could do with darkness.

[Speaker 3]
I can, but it's, I can shapeshift into a bird and fly when I have demolished darkness, so. It would only work for me, so I can't bring anyone else. I just thought the voice was inside the camp, and then I could probably sneak into it myself if I needed to.

But that's not the case, so.

[Speaker 4]
Of course not, things are never that simple.

[Speaker 8]
Wouldn't be as fun if they were.

[Speaker 2]
So now we're gonna have to find a way to the other side of the thing, or something. Um.

[Speaker 4]
Can you change the color of what you've drawn, because it's very light blue on mid-gray for me, and I can barely see it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it is hard to see. How many more uses have passed without a trace he got? Like, so, three hours.

[Miijaco]
Well, that would be probably enough time for us to get across, wouldn't it?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but then we couldn't use it to get back.

[Miijaco]
He said he's got three, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I got three hours worth of it, so I would imagine it would take longer than an hour to get across. Either way. And then one to sneak up and find the thing, so I think we have more than enough.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. Might be easier to change the background color, maybe to something darker.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, they'll probably think it's because of some sort of PNG.

[Speaker 8]
Because I think you can't change all the colors at once.

[Referee (James)]
You can't change all the colors at once. You know what, I'm just going to change the, uh, big lines.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, well, those are the main ones. Everything else could be whatever. And the problem is, even if the, um, like, we're on the other side.

Is this a cliff face itself? Or are we in the valley?

[Referee (James)]
There is a trail leading downwards.

[Speaker 2]
From outside? Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, so. So we can go down into this valley, but we can't really get up that cliff.

[Speaker 2]
There's also a... Let's see.

[Speaker 7]
I don't know if Tariqa was here, because he's got, like, fly and, um, and spider climb and all sorts of other nifty spells.

[Referee (James)]
So the overlook is coming through a tunnel, or an overbridge. These are not uncommon throughout the course of the valley.

[Speaker 2]
But you guys have the option of either going down the, uh, trail, that goes into a pool of water. All right. Or you can go around this one.

I'd say go around.

[Speaker 3]
I'd say go around. If that goes, if that can bridge us to the other side, and we are elevated on a position, right, that makes it, uh, easiest for us to hide, especially if we can't lean to the left, you know, sight lines and all.

[Speaker 2]
So. Yeah. I mean, it's out in the open.

Stop across the bridge, and continue towards the voice. That's good. All right.

And I wouldn't imagine it taking very long to do it either. So. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So before we do that, do we want to send the boots on ahead to, um, where the voice might actually be, so we can just scout out that ahead of time, or? We'll do that after we get across. Well, the thing is that both B-Sense and, um, Pass Without Trace require concentration, so I won't be able to see anything else.

So gathering information goes out the window at that point.

[Speaker 4]
Go with, um.

[Miijaco]
Okay, we'll do it without Pass Without a Trace.

[Speaker 4]
No, go with Pass Without a Trace. I'll use my familiar, um, to surveil.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. As long as we generally know where the, where the, you know, where the voice is, otherwise, I'll do.

[Speaker 4]
All right. Using my familiar like that leaves me blind and deaf, so somebody is going to need to, basically.

[Speaker 7]
I'll carry you. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Or just lead me. Carrying is very kind.

[Referee (James)]
Jacque was just, like, halfway through the sentence, just getting real firebusters.

[Speaker 4]
Is it a bridle carry or a toss over the shoulder fireman? I think it's a fireman.

[Miijaco]
I'd say fireball. I mean, fireman's carry. Let's get out of here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so you guys move along. The familiar alerts you there are sentries posted along this side of the wall.

[Referee (James)]
Once every 50 yards or so, there's somebody holding a, usually a musket.

[Speaker 2]
A few of them have long bows. And they are in pairs of two.

[Speaker 3]
We'll probably lean to the far side here and basically keep our distance from them as much as possible using whatever cover we can to sneak by.

[Speaker 4]
I could also have my familiar make a little bit of a distraction, just like a noise in the opposite direction for them to go and investigate.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, sorry, they're investigating the sentries or?

[Speaker 4]
No, I can have my familiar turn invisible, go off on the opposite direction from us and make some noises to have the sentries investigate. So they're kind of looking the other way, not towards us.

[Referee (James)]
All right, I thought I missed something. Okay. Yeah.

It's pretty effective. The sentries keep calling each other over like, hey, did you see something over here? I didn't see anything.

Do you see anything over here? I didn't see. As you guys basically go along the, around, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so and I'm glad you guys have passed it up.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, and you're really going to trail, so they have no idea anyone went by.

[Speaker 2]
So the, oh goodness. Birds lead you in this direction, there upon you find yet another canyon.

[Referee (James)]
No, not canyon. A ravine. You guys find a ravine.

I can't remember. You folks find a ravine that appears to, very steep, it sinks basically, there's a stairway, makeshift stairway, elsewhere, passes for stairs in the Kay Wild. Leading downward, but it's very steep and it goes right into darkness.

And you're, all your birds are chirping and indicating that.

[Speaker 8]
We all have dark devil sight though, don't we?

[Referee (James)]
Yep. I believe you do, but you're still able to see that like, it is dark.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. It's dark down there. It's going to be a problem.

I hope darkness makes it easier to hide. Well, shall we? Yeah, well.

It's a close thing.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so as you folks get downwards, or arrive downwards, you come across a pool of mercury. Vertical and obscuring your path.

[Speaker 2]
Vertical? Yes. Like a wall of mercury.

Oh. How do you look it? This looks more like the expertise of the spellcaster.

Yeah. You got nothing for it?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, great. Sorry, I was too busy thinking about Mad Hatters.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, while you guys think about this, I'm going to refill my coffee.

[Speaker 2]
I can do detect magic. Do that real quick, could you?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, conjuration magic.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Should, I think I got to spell magic. Would that help any?

[Speaker 7]
Could do. Uh, I don't know, I don't think we can spell, so does it work on any magical effects?

[Speaker 2]
I think it just works on magic.

[Miijaco]
Let me click it real quick.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, choose one object, uh, creature, object of magical effect within range. Target ends. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
One of the, uh, one of the birds flies off your shoulders, flies directly into the puddle of mercury.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, buddy, don't do that.

[Miijaco]
I cast a spell magic before he gets into it.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, roll initiative. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um, because of my vanguard ability, um, we go first on whatever initiative it takes, so.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, there you go.

[Speaker 3]
For the first round of combat, we will go first, and I can pick two other people to go first with me. That's not good.

[Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Don't bother with me.

Possibly do bother with me. I don't know. I don't think I've ever had to do it.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so instead of a combat here, it's just a, it looks like, I guess, if you have the thing that looks like that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Oh, is this, yeah, is this a combat or an, uh, No, no.

[Speaker 2]
Seeing you write this spell before the bird dies.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Oh, roll initiative to see what happens first. Oh, I see.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Derp. Derp, derp, derp.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if they're positive.

[Referee (James)]
I think it's just going to be Mijako.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, vanguard, um, threat or hazard, you always act first. Oh, actually, yeah, if this is a threat or hazard. Um, if not, then it doesn't matter.

[Miijaco]
Where is initiative again?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. I gotta click my token. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
So this is a combat encounter. Yes, the photo that's trying to kill you.

[Referee (James)]
Mijako, it's not a combat encounter. Just.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm trying to figure out how to do initiative without the combat thing. What do I press? Oh, that.

Okay. Yeah. No, I don't think so.

I got a 16 on dex. Yeah, plus three, plus proficiency. Yeah.

Well, in any case, your spell magic goes first, I guess. Yeah, you could. Okay, so it's a charisma roll of saving throw.

Ability ability check. Does it 15? Uh, 15 will suppress it for about 10 minutes.

Quickly now. As we as I begin herring us along through where the mercury wall was. Yep.

All right. So downwards. Yep.

[Referee (James)]
Guys come across. A not too expensive. Here is a lady.

Pretty clearly sylvan in nature. Wearing an ivory mask that has no slits for eyes or mouth, but does have two rather large deer antlers growing out of the, or sorry, elk antlers growing out of the place where the eye sockets on the mask are supposed to be.

[Speaker 4]
Cool.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's creepy. Thanks.

[Speaker 4]
Kyrona immediately like reaches up and pats her head to make sure that her own antlers are like still there, are comparable in size.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know if they're comparable in size, but they are, um, maybe a little bit. I'm imagining the, I'm trying to picture the token and compare the other.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Kyrona's got like four point buck horns. So it's probably not comparable.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. The Elks, if you've seen like an Elk or some person, I haven't seen the Elk person, but I have seen the Moose person.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Do we see any containers, any thing that might contain the voice? So I assume when they took the voice, they might've put it in something.

[Referee (James)]
Does anybody say anything to this lady who's just staring at you?

[Speaker 4]
No, absolutely not.

[Speaker 7]
I didn't know she, I thought she hadn't taken us. I didn't realize she hadn't.

[Speaker 8]
If she's already spotted us, Para's gonna wave.

[Speaker 2]
She waves back. Does anybody here speak Sylvan by the way? Yep.

I do. Alrighty. She says, welcome travelers.

Care to exchange gifts? Care to learn any magic? That would depend upon the price you would request in return.

That depends upon what is being offered. Do we have anything to offer? I don't know if we do now.

[Speaker 7]
I don't have anything because I'm poor.

[Speaker 4]
We are interested in recovering the voice of Wollyria.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, I guess I thought I heard her. But she seemed smaller. She had been contained.

The leader of an army passed through Outlaw. I can tell you. Amen.

Why is there a price? We do have those tokens, the flight tokens. I have those with Wollyria.

Oh, hang on. Dapple. Oh, okie dokie.

Did I miss anything? No, we haven't said anything since you left.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So, she's ready to either give you a little bit of information or maybe gantrip and exchange. Do your horns grow back by any chance? Do my horns go back?

[Speaker 7]
Grow back, yes.

[Speaker 4]
Um, no, they're permanent.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, just wondering. I hear deer grow their horns back.

[Speaker 4]
I've had them since I was eight. I'm very attached to them, both literally and emotionally.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, I just wasn't sure whether they were like deer or they grow back in summer.

[Speaker 4]
I could do druidcraft to give her a flower or I could do goodberry.

[Speaker 3]
We do have the flight tokens. Perhaps we can trade those.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but we may want to save them. Well, we've got to give something out. I have all these bird whistles.

She doesn't...

[Speaker 7]
Well, I'm not sure what someone wearing a mask would do as a bird whistle.

[Speaker 2]
I have those nets. I could possibly trade for rust.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I have some glowing leaves.

[Speaker 2]
Peggy is very interested in them. Yeah, Pearl, go for up some bird whistles.

[Speaker 7]
And I would like to give her my flight token. I probably won't need it.

[Referee (James)]
All right, in exchange for the bird whistles, she'll tell you folks that the commander or I guess she'll work that passed by with a few of his men had a had a giant eagle contained within his necklace and had a voice contained within his glade such that they appeared to be made out of sound. The word that she uses is woven out of sound. In exchange for the flight token, she's going to teach Robin.

[Speaker 2]
She's going to teach Mr. Robin the cantrip to often tone. Okay, Travis.

[Referee (James)]
He stands up. Ross brushes herself off and says, well, that's enough. Goodies collected for one day.

By the way, I think you might be seeing the green guard suit. Do remember to give him mine. And then she...

[Speaker 2]
Could we have your name to give to him?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I don't think we got her name.

[Speaker 4]
I think he'll, um, know the lady with antlers for eyes. Like, that is fairly unique, even for the Feywild.

[Speaker 2]
Anyways, we got a lord to catch. Yeah. So our targets are his necklace and his glade, eh?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay, yeah, that sort of worked.

[Speaker 2]
Why is the text sort of muttered? There we go. Uh, yeah, yeah, that works.

Sonic, I guess. Okay, cast a spell on the ant. Huh.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so, uh, let's see if there's still places to, uh, go inside this cavern.

[Speaker 8]
What are the birds doing?

[Referee (James)]
The birds are waiting to continue downward. We follow the birds down, I'd say.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, in this room specifically, other than the masked, uh, fey, is there, like, stuff? Or was it kind of just an empty room with that fey in it?

[Referee (James)]
There's a lot of flowers around. There's a seat composed of, uh, plant matter, plant material that she was sitting on. It's not, like, rocky and sparse and everything.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm, I have to get myself some quartz for this. It's an egg shelf. Hmm, neat.

So, are you guys, I'm gonna guess. Yeah, we're continuing down, following the birds down the paths, down the tunnels.

[Referee (James)]
All right, you guys come across another wall of mercury.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, anyone else got death spell magic? Nope. Okay, I'll take care of this one as well.

Go ahead and make a roll.

[Referee (James)]
The pool shimmers a little bit. You could see a new destination on the, through the pool, briefly get illuminated. Looks to just be a shrine to the green god that is the forest.

Then you see a second mercury pool at the end of, at the end of the road on the other side.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Are we sure these are actually dangerous?

[Speaker 8]
I know mercury is normally, but.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want to poke it?

[Speaker 8]
You know, yeah, I'll poke it.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, you have a familiar, you could just send that, so.

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to be unfamiliar, I'm sure. Because I just found out, relatively inexperienced. Para's gonna poke it.

Oh, go ahead.

[Referee (James)]
So you have a mercury counter, it sticks to you, you're aware that there's some magic.

[Speaker 2]
Hey look, now you're silver cobalt. I guess we got no option, we go through. Oh, after you.

[Referee (James)]
I go through. Step in and out the other side, just right down somewhere near, I guess not.

[Speaker 2]
One mercury.

[Referee (James)]
You folks are, like I said, you're in a grove. It is, how do I put this? You know those hexagonal wooden walls that people would use for growing vines?

Stuff like that, like a vine-like thing.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, a vertical planter.

[Referee (James)]
True, same deal. Kind of, yeah. The canopy basically looked like somebody took one of those and stretched it into a hemisphere.

Over this area, such that all the trees have basically grown in a roughly hexagonal pattern. And interwoven, more or less lock this, whatever this place is, lock it in from the out.

[Speaker 2]
I'd say we, where's the birds heading?

[Referee (James)]
The birds deviated to sit on the green god's shoulders and looked as if they were listening to something. And then flew back to you guys and indicated there is a second portal on the outside, on the other side of.

[Speaker 8]
We got to give that guy the regards.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was about to say the lady with the mask with horn. Uh-oh.

[Referee (James)]
All right, sorry, you guys said, what did you guys say?

[Speaker 2]
We gave the regards to the horn king for the lady.

[Referee (James)]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
From the lady.

[Referee (James)]
So, the head turns towards whoever gives her regards. You see its lower jaw open and the mask that the green god wears. Green god is a very angular figure, still smooth, but there's like all, his costume or his appearance, his clothing, extraordinarily severe, on all depictions, including this statue that occupies the shrine.

[Speaker 4]
Severe as in plain, plain or sharp lined?

[Speaker 2]
Sharp lined.

[Referee (James)]
He himself shares massive elk antlers that you saw earlier that come and the ivory mask face, except in his case, it's not like over the face. It composes his face.

[Speaker 2]
Woven hooves at the bottom, digitic ray. Heat, basically a satyr or faun's light.

[Speaker 4]
I may have to roll arcana for this. Is he actually a god or does he just call himself that?

[Speaker 2]
Definitely will, especially from you.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so you're a little bit more familiar with Feylord. The original Fey were the shadows of humans. Our power spontaneously fed off of more or less terrorizing people up until and took great pride in things that humans more or less just found interesting.

So, beauty was one of them.

[Speaker 2]
In between stealing babies, angelings and proto-elves and proto-fey, shadows.

[Referee (James)]
Art leave them on doorsteps and this just made people even until one day, their domain started spreading out across other places and found something profoundly found a world that was appropriate and wanted to join it, wanted to take basically take part in what they saw. The details are more or less lost to history, except for sorry, but Rona, being that this is her patron, but no, Oberon was the first to among the feys, quote-unquote, repent and accept a pseudo mortality in the promise that they're around. This is the act that created the fey, created the elves, created basically everything associated.

So, coming to some of the fey became arch-fey, some of them became gods, Oberon became a god. Occupies a kind of slate, slot, a dual slot in the pantheon.

[Speaker 2]
There he is, both king of the fey and god of and one of his, go ahead. I was gonna say just based on that, Kyron is gonna step forward and kneel, but if you have more to say, I would love to hear it.

[Referee (James)]
I do. Please continue. One of his progeny was called Symbol, which was the elven god of knowledge.

He was known as a crucified deity that had been dead for about a millennia, but recently became active again.

[Speaker 2]
So, this guy is one of Oberon's kids?

[Referee (James)]
Quite. Okay. The god, based off the lore received from Kyron, was a shard of Symbol that died, sorry, that fled to escape his crucifixion, basically traveled around, at that time been bound, and existed as its own like shard of power.

For a while. For it, too, was snuffed out by something Oberon does. But with Symbol's return as a priest, there are increasing signs that three.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
With the regards and with your bowing, Brian, the mask splits open in half, or not quite in half. I guess the lower third, where you would expect him out to be, and he splits in such a way that the mask forms its own set of jagged teeth. Blue liquid, much like water, roughly the same.

Falls, spills out very, very slowly as gravity is really taking its time with the liquid.

[Speaker 2]
And pours into a small receptacle, about the shape of a birdbath, probably about the about the size of a birdbath.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know why I said small. Big enough to fit a couple of heads in it, maybe more.

[Speaker 2]
That is a very interesting measurement. I mentioned birdbath because it starts with a birdbath. Um, how may I repay you?

Just a sense with. Oh. Well, we best get.

[Referee (James)]
Sorry, one last detail. I misread my notes here. It does pour into a small receptacle.

Receptacle is like a cup that you can take out beneath that cup, or beneath that like small like saucer.

[Speaker 2]
Easy bird. I'm gonna. Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna dump out my water skin and gather up some of that liquid.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to follow her lead.

[Speaker 4]
And I'm going to take one of the daggers that I have and do some of my magical crafting to make the handle look organic, like sort of between wood and antler. And leave that in the birdbath.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
The birdbath isn't like an infinite, isn't like an infinite pool or anything, but once it hits the bottom, it just kind of went. One of the ripples from the birds playing around with it passes a dagger and when the water is set.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to sniff the stuff. Not going to drink it yet, but I am going to sniff it. Smells like boots.

Smells like, it smells like madness. Hey. This is kind of what boots smell like most of the time.

[Speaker 4]
So like Long Island iced tea?

[Speaker 2]
Maybe. Maybe madness smells different to everybody. Anyways, we got another thingy to go through.

Sorry, just say that again. We got another wall portal thingy to go through. Or more.

I'm not sure.

[Miijaco]
But we be on the hunt for this voice and we probably should get going.

[Speaker 4]
Let's make sure the birds say we should keep going. Are you guys just like taking a break? Or is this the place?

Why am I talking to birds? I can't actually speak to animals. Robin!

[Referee (James)]
Indicate that you're getting ready to leave. They do kind of perk up.

[Miijaco]
Okay. Can I try and cover one of the birds? Well, protect one of the birds from the mercury and in case they do, it does something bad when eventually it had one less marker on them.

[Referee (James)]
They resist your attack.

[Miijaco]
I'm not trying to grab them. I'm trying to just get in the way of the mercury from them. Yeah, I'll just go through with them.

Here we go again.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so you are back in another level. Yeah, so you make your way into the portal. You are back in the ravine going further downwards.

[Speaker 3]
That was an interesting detour.

[Referee (James)]
I'm gonna go refill my cup. You guys want to take a five minute break?

[Speaker 3]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 9]
I feel like I need to refresh my life. Tell me. Yeah, I get that too.

Like the aviation brain. Like, oh god, I feel like I'm back in the flesh.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. All right, I'll take a break. Five of them.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Miijaco]
Huh?

[Speaker 10]
Ow.

[Speaker 2]
Now it's hitting. Oh.

[Miijaco]
Guys, I need to bow out. The Mexican and alcohol I had before or getting on is starting to burn back. So I'm going to be looking for Tums or something.

[Referee (James)]
All righty.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, Mijako had to leave. Um, he was having some real bad heartburn.

[Speaker 4]
I wasn't sure if he said he was out out or just longer break out.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I think he was implying he was out out, but because he said call it for the night.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that was implication I got. I mean, if we if we have to, uh, put this on hold until next week, then that's fine. I'm okay with that.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, okay.

[Referee (James)]
So because we're in the Feywild, we could get it right. We could actually get away with this.

[Speaker 3]
Guys, as we did a bit of portal hop and jumping. So, you know, climbing on me.

[Referee (James)]
So, yeah. So basically, I think what we do is if we did leave it off for next session, because with only three people here, I'm, I'm okay now. I'm just nervous about the next.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm speaking comedy.

[Referee (James)]
I was saying, uh, yeah, um, you guys would probably do okay. Uh, it would just maybe take an extra hour to without me, like pulling my punches.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm okay with holding off and things.

That's just, you know, shit happens. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
What we can do is next session that we have, we have that be a longer session. Uh, and in the process, basically it would wrap up this and we would do Valeria's ballad in the same set. Sounds good.

[Speaker 3]
Sounds like a plan.

[Referee (James)]
I'll just keep you guys on the bear belt treadmill. Uh, there's that. I don't think it's the same for me, but, uh, basically keep you guys on track.

Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, there you go. Well, uh, hey, what? Yeah, it was a hour, 45 minutes.

You guys got a lot done for an hour, 45 minutes.

[Speaker 3]
Speed running that stuff.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, yeah.

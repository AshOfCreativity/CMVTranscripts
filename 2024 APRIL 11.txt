[Speaker 9]
You know that town with the, um...

[Speaker 1]
Dragon Police?

[Speaker 2]
With the iceberg that almost caused the tsunami?

[Speaker 1]
Sexist Occupations Code 23.453 2308.453 I'm gonna go get myself a cup of coffee. Challenge you to a duel!

[Speaker 2]
Um... Faye, we won't name names, dropped a really bad creature on that iceberg, so that town...

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, that thing.

[Speaker 8]
Uh... Oh yeah, I remember that.

[Speaker 2]
The town, we...

[Speaker 5]
Well, it wasn't on the town, per se, it was on the iceberg, which is right next to the town.

[Speaker 2]
I mean...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And he said it was, and I quote, a funny prank to play. Like the cabbage guy. That town has become the cabbage guy.

[Speaker 4]
How do I rotate my character? I tried to open this on a laptop, and just, uh...

[Speaker 2]
It's like shift or control, and then you do the little, um... Scroll wheel. Alright, I got it, thank you.

Yeah.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm.

[Speaker 6]
Have people still not claimed plus two blood woe vial?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think there are enough sorcerers. That's it.

[Speaker 4]
Damn. Huh. Are there not enough sorcerers?

[Speaker 10]
Do we have any sorcerers? I don't think we have the entirety of the campaign.

[Speaker 4]
Well, shit.

[Speaker 1]
I think, like, maybe three.

[Speaker 4]
Right.

[Speaker 6]
So, Lucin got... Like... The name Lucin, out of ASMR, is probably both a hilarious pun and a terrifyingly bad one.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Go collect my coffee. So the place that we're adventuring today is Asherahs. Which is...

Up in the north. It is the city furthest north.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Damn. The what? The city?

[Speaker 1]
The city furthest north. There is a...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see it, I see it. Yes, that's where Mimros's dagger is, I remember now.

[Speaker 1]
This is where the Wizard Corrigan lives. Oh, Tordramon. I need to adjust that, because that fell into the underground.

Here.

[Speaker 2]
I'm supposed to find the one Romancer, as Otter calls it. I don't know what that means. Whatmancer?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Nyromancer. Or Oniromancer.

[Speaker 2]
Oniromancer, okay.

[Speaker 8]
A mage of...

[Speaker 2]
She likes to twist how she pronounces stuff. I don't know. Something different.

What kind of magic is that? It's a dream answer. Divines through dreams.

[Speaker 3]
Very different than that.

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 3]
So there's an old word for masturbation, which is Onanist.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, it's okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's all good.

[Speaker 8]
You can seize. That's funny. Nobody expects the Count Wizard.

[Speaker 9]
How many fucking Perf Wizards are in this valley?

[Speaker 2]
More than you would think.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a Perfmancer of the highest caliber.

[Speaker 8]
I bet they have a club with stamp cards. They all wear fedoras.

[Speaker 3]
And nothing else.

[Speaker 1]
The objective today, the two objectives today are twofold. Or I guess technically, there's a third. Nessie is looking for a man here that wields a special magic dagger, and apparently desires to murder him and take this dagger away.

Which is completely understandable.

[Speaker 8]
You could also steal it.

[Speaker 3]
Do we want to murder him?

[Speaker 2]
You could steal it, but if he wants it back, I don't want to get stuck in a tag. Well, he doesn't have to know that you have it.

[Speaker 8]
Why are we killing this guy?

[Speaker 2]
Nah. I never said I wanted to kill this guy. I said I wanted the dagger.

If I have to kill him, fine. But I am okay with just stealing it. Okay.

In one of the ballads, she fought him. His dagger looked cool. It's most likely something she has to attune with, so she can use it if she wants it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
It's just being greedy.

[Speaker 1]
The second thing is that Hera is looking for a way to stave off the Shivagroth's madness.

[Speaker 8]
And hopefully that's worth it. So she's looking for a way to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Stave off what? So do you remember that spider creature? Oh wait, you might not have been here for one of these sessions.

[Speaker 8]
Do you remember that spider creature that everyone's watching? Imagine a millipede, but with spider legs. Ew.

Okay. And more than one head.

[Speaker 2]
We dealt with it with Zephain's ballad, and then What is the relevance for today?

[Speaker 3]
What are we doing with it?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so besides the dagger quest that apparently is happening, we want to find a way to kill this really, really big one?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so there is a giant one in a meteor over by Zephain, and it has a madness effect to it that affects everyone. So we're trying to find a way to buff us out from that, or stop it so that we can kill Yeah, especially because if we don't kill it in time, it's just going to spawn a bunch of mini sugarroths in every square that has, sorry, in every hex that has ice on it, which is a lot.

[Speaker 6]
So, kill the comet to stop a brethren moon scenario. Got it.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, so the thing that we're looking for is some kind of a boon to in order to be able to approach it? Was that what you said?

[Speaker 8]
It's more just information.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, wait, let me... Yes. Well, Terror Recover was the idea that you could have a little battle in the center of the mine was one of your options for kind of immunizing yourself from this kind of fear in the future.

There's also the idea that you could also turn yourself undead to avoid this kind of madness effect, because the undead do not train, so they're afraid of the predations of a barren creature like the sugarroth. But in either case, Terror was led to was led towards the Oniromancer, the same one that Nessie is looking for at the moment for the sake of looking at this ability, so she's looking for information as well. And then finally, any kind of information that you guys are looking for, this is Cheros, it's a large city in the north, they've been dealing with the frost for a large period of time.

If you're looking to cover campaign history or campaign knowledge or try to get some ins with players in the campaign, not literal players, but like major faction heads and stuff like that, this is where the first and original quest crew lives, Corga and the Wizard, who first keyed the players off to the Sun Shrines and how they work.

[Speaker 8]
But, yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Is that why you said it would be good to bring the Doctor along? I think he's a little toasted though from the traveling. I smell toast.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, it might be good for the Doctor, it just depends on how the Doctor over there.

[Speaker 9]
Alright, now that I have coffee.

[Speaker 1]
So those of you at the So what I want you guys to discuss is like, okay, things that you might want to get, whether it's magic items or information or new quests or like if you want to spawn a quest or something like that, I'm listening on here, and then we're going to jump into the city for all. And I have my OBS camera open for a reason, because I'm going to go down to Incarnate.

[Speaker 8]
And I will be drawing out the city while I do this.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Do you want to just kind of take turns saying what one or two things we'd be interested in? Start at the bottom. Rez?

[Speaker 9]
Alright, so assuming I'm bringing Corpus along, he'd be looking for a place of, what are they called? Monasteries? Places where monks gather.

Yes, and while he would be there, he'd upon receiving, because he got a scroll, last session from that wizard in the tower of like a monk. It was a scroll that a monk could use. His entire idea is he's going to go there and try to learn more about this kind of magic.

Does that make sense?

[Speaker 3]
Do you want to learn more about monk magic?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, monk magic.

[Speaker 3]
Very cool.

[Speaker 2]
Magic named after him.

[Speaker 3]
Is that like your main interest, or is there any side interest, or is that like you get that, you'll be happy?

[Speaker 9]
That's my main interest. Side interest would be to go around perusing taverns and maybe trying to find a hireling that's a little more knowledgeable about magic than he is.

[Speaker 3]
Find a hireling for magic research slash knowledge. Cool. Nessie, what about you?

[Speaker 2]
Dagger Onimancer.

[Speaker 3]
Dagger Onimancer.

[Speaker 2]
And then, of course, monk magic for monk, but he's not going to be here, so that's just me.

[Speaker 3]
Monk magic. Macaroni?

[Speaker 4]
Cheese.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Can't forget the cheese.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, yes, yes. Naturally. Probably would be looking into the well, given the Shiva Cleroth and the fear effect, probably try to find a way of maybe something related to that, maybe a backlash effect perhaps?

[Speaker 3]
Looking for a backlash effect for what? With regard to the fear effect around the comet?

[Speaker 6]
Probably for additional protection from fear effects.

[Speaker 3]
Additional protection from fear effects.

[Speaker 6]
Really just mind affecting mind affecting things in general, but fear and charm would probably be a priority. Lucent already has some of that given from his subclass, but more help never hurts, you know.

[Speaker 8]
Anything else, or mostly just that?

[Speaker 6]
Probably leads on just more magic items really in general.

[Speaker 3]
Magic items in general.

[Speaker 6]
If all else fails and the item isn't something he personally would need, then he could just sell the information off to people who would need it.

[Speaker 3]
Sure, yeah. Magic items, treasure, yes. Heart, how about you?

[Speaker 5]
Due to the whole recommending to bring the scientist thing, it's probably going to be looking for ways to where darklings are and stuff. Because I'm looking for one specific one and then just general magic items to help with both capture, boosting intelligence, and general sticking together. And due to the, I guess, secondary mission of trying to look for ways to stave off death, anything to do with that.

[Speaker 3]
Staving off death? What's that?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, main one. Main one is just the darkling quest.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I got that. I just, I haven't heard this death thing.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, right, yes, no. It's a more of a It's a more of, let's find a way to make sure that death need not happen. As you all know, classic.

[Speaker 3]
The entire world for just you? Is this like a Fountain of Youth situation?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I remember you talking about this.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, this is the Doctor's whole thing. An eternal world for everyone sort of thing. That is a terrifying idea, but I love it.

[Speaker 3]
And then I guess the other I was just going to ask for clarification on the other component, which was you said darkling locations, but that was only because you have a specific darkling you're interested in, right?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
And then you said magic items to help with capture, boosting intelligence, and sticking together. Is that like you want to corral the darklings and help them improve? Or is this like boosting your own intelligence?

[Speaker 5]
I think that was a misunderstanding on the that was a misunderstanding on the sticking together thing. That was just either or. Sorry.

So yes, boosting intelligence and or capture.

[Speaker 3]
Boosting intelligence of who? Of you? Of your party members?

Of darklings? Boosting own intelligence to help with capture. Is that the capture of the darkling?

[Speaker 5]
Or just of It's rather slippery, so yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So that's like the intended purpose. You don't like the butterfly net that's good against darklings.

[Speaker 5]
Or what is the thing called? Or like the iron bands of Galatra or something like that, but yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Feats of force. And then what is the sticking together thing?

[Speaker 5]
That one was me misspeaking. It was just any general magic items that would be useful for a wizard.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. General magic items useful for a wizard. So you're bringing a wizard?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm bringing the wizard.

[Speaker 3]
Cool, very good. And then Fragatha.

[Speaker 4]
So Charis is going to be looking out for, asking around. I want to find places like vaults and stuff that I can raid. I want to be a good thief.

A big thief. But I want to break in. I want to find locations that have lots of treasure that I can break into and extract said stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And you're going to end up meeting Mimosa's family.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy, is that a good thing? It's good and bad. But yeah, I want to start a thief guild type thing.

But I need money to start that.

[Speaker 8]
Oh yeah, right. I also need money in order to spawn skeletons somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
So Charis is a thief?

[Speaker 3]
I'm bringing a thief.

[Speaker 2]
He's a wannabe.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, wannabe. I'm a level 3 thief in training.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Charis, you have a shit ton of money, right? Maybe. Have you been writing down your money?

[Speaker 8]
Girl.

[Speaker 4]
You need to keep track of your stuff. I have $1,000.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like you should hire an accountant because you might already have this money somewhere under your mattress or something.

[Speaker 10]
$1,000 gold total?

[Speaker 3]
The position is not for you. Maybe you're more of the dreamer. The chief dreamer architect.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'm bad at collecting the stuff. I mean, splitting it up and whatnot.

Hard time taking stuff.

[Speaker 5]
Is it $1,000 gold total or by $1,000 do you mean... Okay, that makes sense.

[Speaker 4]
I only have $1,000 gold. That's pretty good. Could be better.

Should be better considering I've done quite a bit.

[Speaker 5]
So you're probably missing a lot. I'm missing a lot, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
We'll just say it's been life expenses.

[Speaker 3]
I've just been processing the whole time.

[Speaker 6]
The local IRS either really hate you or really love you.

[Speaker 3]
I have to decide whether to bring my wizard or my rogue. I'm suffering indecision.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so what are their golds? If you talk them out, you can see if it's easier for them to...

[Speaker 3]
Well, my rogue probably wants a magic gun, like a magic musket or something. Magical weapon. My wizard has a ton of money and probably wants to start building a wizard tower and wants to add...

has a bunch of utility spells he wants to add to his spellbook. So he'd be on the lookout for a bunch of scrolls that he could try to scribe into his spellbook. It was a pretty low-level...

I guess the wizard tower is the more advanced thing.

[Speaker 5]
How much gold do you have? Apparently it's 10,000 to start building a place.

[Speaker 6]
Isn't there a spell for wizards that you can literally make?

[Speaker 9]
I think it's called Galdor's Tower.

[Speaker 5]
It's pretty high.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, and another thing. While Corpus is here, he wants to look around and try and see if he can purchase a Period of Wound Closure, because this is a city and cities will potentially have this.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah. Just a small thing.

[Speaker 3]
44,300 gold pieces.

[Speaker 8]
I just put the platinum and XP and stuff like that from the last Blue Dragon Hunt, several of which you participated in. Pretty sure I added that from last time.

[Speaker 4]
No, that was just for Rowan.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay. And that's for each of us? Yeah.

And then also, there's the mummy fight for loot and XP.

[Speaker 1]
There was 22,000 gold pieces and 1,200 platinum pieces. That was 3,142 gold per character and 1,171 platinum per character.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, this is per character. How many characters did you bring to the session? The Blue Dragon one?

Yeah. Do you mean the group total or me specifically?

[Speaker 5]
Because me specifically was just one.

[Speaker 1]
Because you were like, oh, this is per character. I was like, I don't think that you brought anybody besides Doc.

[Speaker 5]
No, it was just him.

[Speaker 1]
I was just referencing the list. So Kibi has that amount of gold. Yeah, 3,142 and 171 platinum, which is 1,710 gold equivalent.

[Speaker 8]
And then Charis also has that amount. 3,876. I hate math.

Wait, you said the gold and platinum was per person? We can't hear you. Why?

Rez? Yes? Why?

What do you mean, why?

[Speaker 1]
What do you think I mean, why? Why are you asking that question? You didn't have more than one character participate there.

[Speaker 8]
Unless I misremembered. Corpus? Yeah, so that's one character.

Right. There's literally only one person who brought... No, there were two people who brought more than one character.

It was Nessie and... Nessie brought more than one character and Kibi brought more than one character. The reason I asked that was because I didn't know if we were splitting that gold between all the people who participated in the Blue Dragon Hunt.

It was split... No, that's for the mummy fight. Okay, so it was split...

[Speaker 9]
Okay, I know, I understand that.

[Speaker 1]
I'm talking about the mummy fight right now.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 8]
You guys haven't split up the Blue Dragon Hunt XP and stuff like that, have you?

[Speaker 3]
So I saw you guys are doing a city crawl.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, we're in the middle of a session right now. You are free to spectate.

[Speaker 3]
I was just going to ask something. Is a city crawl any different from a dungeon crawl?

[Speaker 8]
You're free to spectate quietly. Is what I meant to say. All right.

So, Phineas, what is our collected list of golds here?

[Speaker 1]
Have we gone through the entire thing?

[Speaker 3]
We've gone through the entire thing. I am going to bring Lirion. So I guess we'll start with me.

I can post it in OOC. That'll probably be easier.

[Speaker 1]
My apologies, where's this getting posted?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to post it to OOC. I was just finishing typing out my section of it. Posted a little bit too much.

[Speaker 1]
I have a tag here. Go ahead. Oh, nobody ever tags me.

[Speaker 3]
Can you tag in Foundry?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. It's inside Discord.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Player interest. Rez is looking for a monastery. He has a Diamond Sutra that he did not write down the effects of.

Which is fun. He's looking for hireling as well for magic research and knowledge. He's looking for the Oniromancer, the dagger, and he's also interested in some monk magic it looks like.

Let's see here. Macaroni and cheese. Are you bringing...

Which character are you bringing? Lucent, of course. Since you mentioned, you know...

[Speaker 6]
Well, I mean, if this is going to be more of a city crawl, it'd probably be best to bring Lucent. Since it has a lot of RP, might as well bring the high charisma character.

[Speaker 1]
And so the one that has a plus zero. All right. And Hart is looking for a metricum for wizard.

More info about the darklings. Paris is looking for a... is looking to start a thieves guild.

Which she...

[Speaker 4]
Maybe not today, but eventually yes. I'd like to get that started.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, it takes time to do that, but you have nearly all the gold that you need. In fact, I'm confident that you do because you haven't been writing down the whole...

[Speaker 4]
I will go back and look through the stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. You've been playing long enough to have a shit ton of money.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, I'm Phineas. Yes. Were you, like, taking notes?

[Speaker 3]
Was I taking... I was taking notes on our discussion. Right.

About the player interests we had, and about our... general objectives that James was summarizing for us. I posted those to OOC.

Those are all the notes I've taken so far for this session.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
It's not a priority, but I might also be on the lookout for a thief hireling.

[Speaker 6]
I'll just add this.

[Speaker 9]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Thief hireling as well. All right. Cool.

[Speaker 5]
So, personally, I still have a bit more gold before I can build my own tower.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's interesting. How much does Dr. Basha have right now?

[Speaker 5]
Assuming... I haven't added the rest of the things yet, but I probably need to do some recalculations, but I think about... Hmm...

I'm going to have to go back to double-check I've got the gold calculations right before I...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but what's your total? I think about 3,000.

[Speaker 5]
I think about 3,000 gold.

[Speaker 1]
That makes sense based on the sessions that she's been to. Wait, no, that he's been to. Let's see here.

I can't remember. Okay. So, y'all are going to get teleported to a...

y'all are going to get teleported to an apartment that smells of fur and alchemical reagents, and is otherwise nasty.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Like, keepy after no baths?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, pretty much. There's a bear sleeping on the couch.

[Speaker 4]
Ew.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There's an alchemist, a brow alchemist, who's running around and desperately trying to keep some potions from spilling over. He's in the process of that. There's a gentleman in a towel.

There's a number of cuts along his arm, and these cat's pupil eyes running over, trying to assist while also trying not to lose the towel.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, dear.

[Speaker 3]
If the towel starts to fall, I want to, like, mage-hand it to keep it up.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
So I'm on the lookout for that.

[Speaker 1]
Not to keep the potions up, of course.

[Speaker 3]
No, no.

[Speaker 5]
Please. I can try to keep the potions up with my mage-hand.

[Speaker 6]
I can also help, because I also have mage-hand. How many of us have mage-hand?

[Speaker 5]
It's a very useful counter.

[Speaker 6]
True.

[Speaker 1]
That's... all right, that's funny.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, you guys are inside of this lovely... So the gentleman who's in the tower is going to introduce himself as Yester. He says, Hey, this...

You kind of caught us at a bad time right now. Who are you?

[Speaker 2]
I recognize Perah.

[Speaker 1]
Perah Sagan?

[Speaker 2]
I said obviously. Obviously we caught you at a bad time.

[Speaker 1]
Perah will introduce everybody. This is Yester. We went on a few adventures together before he retired.

And this is an alchemist? Oh! I can't remember his name.

He says Oblivion. Is the new title ever since I've gotten to that. Yeah, thanks.

Perah's having the same reaction at the moment. He's getting progressively red-faced. Even with the dark skin, getting progressively red-faced as he is talking.

Starts stuttering. Well, ever since I got into the council and they gave me all these lovely whatever's, then I get a couple of resurrection potions. I've seen my personal business accelerate.

So that's been nice. Anyway, they rescued this... I believe it was Morgan, Jesse and Yester here rescued this gentleman from the sewers.

Or from a place beneath the sewers. And brought him back up to the surface. And basically gave him shelter here until he could redeem his own name.

He was a former criminal or something like that. Perah gets shushed at this point. He's like, wait, let's not discuss that right now.

[Speaker 4]
Former criminal? Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I mean, who isn't one?

[Speaker 1]
I'm just reading something up which I was trying to prevent here and luckily we were successful. But yes, it brings everybody to our humble abode here today.

[Speaker 2]
We're going to see a man about a dagger.

[Speaker 5]
I'm looking for... Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no, it was just... Strow yourself. I was wondering if you know any Darklings?

I could talk to.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, that's a slur I haven't heard in a long time.

[Speaker 5]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 3]
No, you have to clarify. Please, before I die.

[Speaker 5]
I clarify? I mean, the species? Not the drow.

Not the...

[Speaker 1]
I'm just messing with you. Yes. Yes, there's a few who recently came to the city, actually.

Hmm. They tend to... Ironically, they tend to inhabit some of the drow quarters.

There are not many here. It's just a couple of buildings.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Could you tell me where?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they'll be in the second ring of the city. And I believe a few of them are staying inside. They tried to stay inside the shackles.

That didn't go so well for them. I believe... Oh wait, no, I'm wrong.

They're actually underneath the shackles. It's a hotel that's on the outer ring of the... The hotel is on the outer ring of the shackles.

[Speaker 4]
Do you know why they're here? No.

[Speaker 1]
No, I didn't think to ask them, really. They're Fae. And at the moment, I am devising a few means of killing Fae, so I'm sure I'll see them at some point and ask some questions.

But besides that, naturally.

[Speaker 5]
Could I? Okay. And then he just keeps quiet.

Why?

[Speaker 4]
Charis is shuddering. Her wings are very much closed behind her. She's making herself feel small.

[Speaker 1]
This is a present company excluded. Of course, of course. It's just the whole Sylvanus thing.

The army on its way.

[Speaker 8]
Ah.

[Speaker 10]
Okay. Have you found...

[Speaker 4]
Have you found a way to kill them?

[Speaker 5]
Well, I mean...

[Speaker 4]
Like, a good, proper way.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe daggers? I mean, in a way that kills people, pretty much. It's pretty much the only thing.

It makes it... The potions I've devised are currently centered around causing mishaps around their own magic, much in the same way. Basically pranking them, much in the same way that they love to prank humans.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Okay. Is this guy trustworthy?

I'm gonna, like, kind of say that very quietly to Mimosa.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, what was that?

[Speaker 4]
Is this guy trustworthy?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, heavens, I don't know. Hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Make an insight check.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to say that he is because he hangs out with Morgan, but that doesn't also mean anything. Insight.

[Speaker 5]
I'm insight checking. Oh, you're good.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it's mad scientist vibes all around. I don't care. He's not concerned with whether you should do something.

He's concerned more with whether you can, which, of course, is spaced and cool. Suck it, Michael Crichton. The books suck.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna inquire about...

[Speaker 1]
If you find DinoDNA, it is God's demand that we create more dinosaurs.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 10]
I'm with you.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, continue. All expenses paid. What the fuck?

We spare no expense. Another vibe you're getting from him is he's more concerned with like, okay, well, there's this new pursuit of scientific research, so I'm going to find... I'm gonna figure out how deep I can go before something kills me or somebody tells me to stop.

[Speaker 4]
Do you know anything about a underground trade of anti-fae like...

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, I've actually been using these as a template here. Some of the Darklings that came in, or I am told that these were pilfered off some of the Darklings or traded. I'm not really sure.

[Speaker 4]
Darklings have them. Hmm.

[Speaker 10]
No, uh...

[Speaker 4]
You wouldn't happen to have one here, would you?

[Speaker 1]
Half-builted, but yes.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
And that's a spare. You can see there's a blade nearby that looks like... You know how bamboo frays once you start, like, chopping it up?

Or really any kind of, like, softer, bendy wood?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's, like, very fibrous. This guy's been taking pieces out of the blade, and now the blade itself looks like it's extremely frayed. It's like the end of a broom.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
And the shards break off and obliterate Fae.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they damage them quite a bit over time. Shrapnel grenades?

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. I don't suppose you, um... You've grinded any of this into dust that might be, um...

perhaps, uh... used in the smelting of, uh... ammunition for firearms?

Have you gone through that sort of an application?

[Speaker 1]
So you can't smelt these. They have to be cold-hammered, which is why you see that this one is frayed once I start taking pieces off of it.

[Speaker 4]
Every time he, like, references to it, Charis kind of, like, edges away from it just a little bit.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry. These blades were made by Fae. I heard this one was actually specifically the work of Pyphus.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
One of the earliest prototypes.

[Speaker 3]
You know where we could procure more of that for our own crafting purposes?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you would need... It's very tightly controlled inside of the Fae, however... Huh.

Here's the... All I know is that, like, I can't get easy access to them, but you have a Fae with you. So...

We do?

[Speaker 3]
We do! Oh my gosh!

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yes. There are a few thieves around Asheros. They've been having some difficulties recently, but my recommendation is, yeah, go ahead and speak with them.

[Speaker 4]
You know where I can find one?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, yes. So you're gonna be looking for the second ring, and then, if you have trouble, look for a beggar on the second ring. There aren't many, but they come out more after dark, and if you end up...

If anybody gives you trouble, my recommendation is to speak with Moira. She's been quite kind as of late with regards to my research.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have any spare magical scrolls I'd be willing to pay you?

[Speaker 1]
Spare magical scrolls?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that you would be willing to part with for a reasonable amount of gold. Say, a fair market value.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe some other time.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Very well.

[Speaker 5]
Of course, as a scientist yourself, you probably know places that help with boosting one's own intelligence. I was just wondering if you know where to get that sort of thing.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Those are the sorts of potions that people craft once or twice in their lifetime.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, pity.

[Speaker 1]
Oh well. Usually applied to oneself.

[Speaker 5]
Makes sense. Fair enough. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Looking for the best possible... Give me a token here that could look like an apartment complex. It's probably just a box, right?

Speaking of which, you guys are inside the middle, if you look outside, you're inside the middle ring of Asheros. Asheros is primarily composed of three rings that the city is built on. It's like a fantasy Venice or Vienna?

Whichever of the two. Whichever one has canals going through the streets, that's kind of this one. There are guards...

[Speaker 3]
Venice. Venice.

[Speaker 1]
Venice, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Vienna, I think, is in Austria.

[Speaker 1]
I think you are completely correct.

[Speaker 4]
Duolingo was very insistent on me learning how to say Vienna in German.

[Speaker 3]
Isn't it just Vienna?

[Speaker 4]
I think it's just Wien or something like that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, of course.

[Speaker 4]
That reminds me...

[Speaker 3]
Germans have war on the bowels.

[Speaker 6]
A reminder from Duolingo, if you miss your Duolingo lessons, Duolingo will chop off your legs.

[Speaker 4]
Very scary.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, here we go. I guess I'm going to put the shackles here. The city has a lot of tall...

for fantasy, this city has a lot of really tall buildings. Not quite skyscrapers, just taller than you're used to. To where things go up to, for instance, a 30th floor is pretty atypical for any freestanding building.

Some of them you see in a dwarven citadel. There's a terrace with no... A few that come close inside the Feywild, but really, it's not common at all.

[Speaker 4]
What's not common?

[Speaker 1]
It's not common to see buildings in this area, not common to see buildings of this size. And one of them, the tallest, which is actually not in the middle of the city at all, Jaster takes the time to point this out to you as the shackles, which was a old world prison you see here, and was converted to a hotel after at some point... That's funny.

[Speaker 4]
Honestly, I'd stay at a hotel that was a prison. That sounds fun. The vibes?

[Speaker 5]
I think the vibes would be immaculate.

[Speaker 10]
Did I examine the stonework?

[Speaker 5]
I'm actually 90% sure there's a place like that in real life.

[Speaker 10]
I think there is.

[Speaker 1]
There are multiple. There are many, yeah. I don't think I stayed at the Baker Hotel, but there was the Baker Hotel, and then it's Sister Hotel that's in Arkansas.

I saw both of them. Hot Springs, Arkansas, and Mineral Wells, Texas. They have sister hotels that are both ostensibly haunted.

Man, remember, Alcatraz got turned into a tourist attraction. Exactly. Alright, so where do people want to go?

[Speaker 9]
Real quick, could Corpus make a history check to determine the origin of these buildings, the stonework?

[Speaker 3]
I think people placed one on top of the other for a long time until it got real high. Alright.

[Speaker 9]
I actually can do this and get plus eight.

[Speaker 4]
Before we leave this wizard, I would like to ask who Moira is.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Moira is... Phineas, I did not roll for the six scrolls out of level 136.

[Speaker 3]
No rush on that at all. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed it if it had happened somewhere else.

[Speaker 1]
If you'd like to roll for those, I'm not really sure how to... I'd like to go fast, actually.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I can figure something out. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll probably just go with the PHP and just randomize.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no worries. Remember the scrolls that you guys got from the mummy horde? The way AD&D treats scrolls, which this is weird to me, but also really fucking cool, I guess.

Scrolls can have multiple spells on them. So if you're taking that scroll, you're taking all of the spells that it has.

[Speaker 3]
Do you scribe the scroll once to get all the spells, or do you scribe one by one?

[Speaker 1]
You scribe one by one. Casting one or scribing one only expends one spell on that scroll. That was going to be my first question.

Does casting one or scribing it burn the entire thing?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it's just like a union of 5th edition-style scrolls, just kind of all in one object.

[Speaker 5]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
Cool.

[Speaker 5]
They made it more efficient.

[Speaker 3]
You mean the earlier edition did something better than 5e did? Sorry. I had something OSR caught in my throat.

My bad.

[Speaker 2]
I'll say it loudly and proudly. 5e sucks.

[Speaker 3]
Who are we? 5e players. What do we want?

Pathfinder 2nd edition.

[Speaker 10]
I was about to say that!

[Speaker 1]
That's amazing. January 2025, we are playing Pathfinder 2nd edition and Astral Falling Tides. Oh, yes.

Fuck yeah. But yeah, because apparently I don't have to do any of this work in 5th edition. Converting this to Pathfinder 2nd edition apparently is mostly just fixing Kingmaker and writing the NPCs, just changing the statistics of NPCs.

I don't even have to make my own monster book anymore. Thank Christ.

[Speaker 3]
Slight procedural question for Foundry. When we do rolls, is it helpful for us to call out what our result is? Or do you prefer to read it off of the rolls?

[Speaker 1]
I find it very helpful for you to call it out. Unless it's a... When I'm waiting...

If it's in the middle of combat or something like that, I find it very helpful.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Otherwise, you're totally fine.

[Speaker 10]
I'm actually not that concerned about it, by and large.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, what do we want to do? Do we want to follow up on the Cold Iron bit? Somebody asked me about Moira.

[Speaker 1]
Moira is the barkeep and the owner of the shackles. She has a few mage apprentices and craftsmen helping her out right now. Actually, an earlier character from this campaign, Armorin, and Artificer, met up with her.

He might be there now. He's not a spy on occasion, but he left his apprentices behind there to just do smithing and handyman work. You might find them together.

Anyways, Moira is the...

[Speaker 5]
Last quick question, just about anything health boosting, because that's less, I guess, coveted than intelligence-based things.

[Speaker 1]
You would be incorrect. They're stupid or far more concerned about their hit points than they are concerned about their health and their general intelligence.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, fair enough.

[Speaker 6]
A lot broader audience and consumer base for that.

[Speaker 5]
True, but they would be more manufactured, so to speak.

[Speaker 1]
It is true. They just get snatched up quite quickly.

[Speaker 2]
If we go to the shackles, we will find... You can ask about the Oniromancer. I'm not going to be able to answer that.

The dreammancer. The shackles hold most of us. The Oniromancer, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Those are the Oniromancer actually in this center ring here. But she doesn't take... She normally doesn't take walk-in clients.

Lady Sane. Let's spell that out. It's H S E I N E.

[Speaker 8]
Hm. What's this wizard's name?

[Speaker 5]
I'm writing...

[Speaker 3]
Lirian! My name is Lirian.

[Speaker 4]
The guy that we're talking to?

[Speaker 2]
Well, at any rate, the Oniromancer's handyman was murdered leaving the shackles, so if we can... I don't know. Maybe if we figure that out, she'll take us on.

[Speaker 8]
I mean, the shackles do hold...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I was going to say, the shackles near the second ring hold quite a bit of the answers we need, including the knives and or Darkling's things.

[Speaker 1]
So shackles in the third area. The drow quarter is a couple of buildings inside the second ring, and then Lady Sane... She lives, and her office is in the center ring here, but she doesn't take walk-in clients.

So I'm going to start putting those... If you guys look at my camera, actually, you'll see where I'm putting this stuff together.

[Speaker 4]
Your camera's off.

[Speaker 1]
Really?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, because I disconnected and then reconnected. So here we go. OBS virtual camera.

Can you see me now?

[Speaker 8]
Yes, we can see you now.

[Speaker 3]
You're not flipped. You're on the bottom right for us. Everything looks fine.

Like, the text on your screen is reading correctly.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, really? Okay, so she's flipped from... Huh.

That's funny.

[Speaker 3]
Does it not look at my own and it says...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, no, that's okay. It's only when I'm looking at myself on Discord that... Okay.

[Speaker 2]
She doesn't take in walk-in, so should we, like, send something requesting to be seen?

[Speaker 1]
Or... Yes, that's going to, generally speaking, that's going to be inside of the... Like I said, generally speaking, that's inside.

What you do is you would get in touch with one of her curators or one of her... Either one of her curators or one of her lackeys inside the second ring here. I don't know if you heard though, but, like, she hasn't been seeing clients for some time and one of her lackeys, unfortunately, did pass away recently by the shackles, actually.

[Speaker 2]
Who is this we're talking about? Oh, Neuromancer. Or Neuromancer.

How would you say? Lady Hasim. Thank you.

H is silent?

[Speaker 1]
H is nearly silent. You're probably not going to hear... The way that my microphone is set up, you're probably not going to hear me say it in my...

Yeah, just like across Discord or something.

[Speaker 2]
So we need to find one of her lackeys. Do you know where they frequent? Do they frequent the shackles?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. So there's... Do they frequent the shackles?

No, I think that there's going to be a party sometime tonight that has a number of different art curators that you could speak with.

[Speaker 10]
A party?

[Speaker 4]
Interesting. I love parties. I'm going to do some bard things.

It's my specialty. Woohoo! The wizard that we're getting this information from is Oblivion.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, he's an alchemist, actually.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Alchemist. I like alchemists.

[Speaker 1]
And then Corpus, what was your roll earlier? I have not forgotten about you.

[Speaker 9]
20.

[Speaker 1]
20? Oh, easy, easy. Yes.

Okay, so... The majority of these buildings are... The majority of the buildings in Asheros are of the Kranic people, who are sort of Irish, I guess we could say, analogous to the Irish.

Very few of them actually still live in Cimayde. But they are more common in the Kragmarite Empire, where they're primarily human slaves.

[Speaker 4]
That's not fun.

[Speaker 1]
But they used to live in Cimayde. Or at least a lot of them did.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that jerk! Ugh, okay.

[Speaker 9]
Well, their architecture was surely impressive, judging by all this.

[Speaker 1]
It's a lot of, like, basically wooden Gothic. It's like a mix of Gothic and rustic architecture. Stuff that looks like somebody turned a farmhouse into a cathedral.

[Speaker 10]
Collect Gothic? Yeah!

[Speaker 5]
It's my favorite type!

[Speaker 1]
But, like, built out of wood, primarily. Burnable. There's a lot of, like, upward-facing architecture.

Stuff that's basically designed to drag your... It's designed to drag your eyes upwards.

[Speaker 6]
So, out of character, if the Amish were found by...

[Speaker 1]
If the Amish were in Warhammer. I totally believe it, yeah. If the Irish were Amish and in Warhammer.

Good work. There we go. That's too small.

Okay, so we have the shackles. And I need to put a spot for the... The Darklings are under the shackles, but then they've also been seen near the Drow Quarter, which is, like, two buildings.

Like, really just two buildings. It's not even properly the Drow Quarter. It's more like, just, hey, there are Drow that live here among some of the other elves that are inside of Sharrows.

[Speaker 4]
How are Drow treated within this city? Because I know that Drow are not, like, loved.

[Speaker 1]
There's definitely some tensions right now, because recently a... Oblivion is Drow himself. He's like, before...

The major troubles that started recently, we were treated quite well. I think my exile from the city definitely didn't help. But the major problem right now is people are nervous about...

I don't know if you know, but a place nearby was sunken into the world below. There were rumors of this before, you know, before all of the frost actually started, but there was a... It really kicked up recently, and the Drow are a suspect, are viewed a little bit more with suspicion.

They're keeping diplomatic channels open, which is good, but everybody's tense. Like, our... The mayor recently just sent a force over to Sederstall to take it over.

Just, no warning. Just going over to annex that town. But everybody's on edge right now.

[Speaker 4]
What of the Fae? Do they... Will I be treated okay here?

Uh... I would... Should I hide my wings?

Do you know Disguise Self? I do. Well, no, I have a disguise kit.

[Speaker 1]
I'll put it this way. You're just as likely to get praised or beloved as anything. Remember, people loved the Fae before the frost stuff started.

It was the source of most people's magical power, was the Fae.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I don't look very frosty, so I think I'll be okay.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. You're rather cheerful. If you were wearing the enemy's uniform, you might have more of a problem, but just in case, I recommend not going anywhere after...

Don't go anywhere alone after dark.

[Speaker 2]
Don't worry.

[Speaker 1]
And besides that, as long as you just haven't made enemies here already, then you're probably fine.

[Speaker 2]
I hope I haven't. No, no. Those Shivergrasses in the Fae wild were good.

[Speaker 4]
I hope I haven't made enemies here.

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty sure it was in the Fae. It was in another dimension. It's fine.

[Speaker 8]
Wouldn't you know?

[Speaker 4]
Wouldn't I know? What? Wouldn't you know if you'd made enemies here?

Well, I... I don't know how far my contacts... like, how far out I have contacts.

Okay. So, I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
We should talk about that. It's a smuggling guild. You definitely have contacts inside of Sharrows.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah. I should probably avoid them. So, maybe.

I probably shouldn't be seen.

[Speaker 1]
You could invoke them. I could. They're not unfriendly with you.

It's a smuggling business, remember. So, people will shit on each other, and people will definitely betray each other for a quick buck, but as far as... How do I send this down?

Can I send this down a layer?

[Speaker 6]
Keep a reputation. That's good for business. If you have a reputation of betraying everyone you work for, no one's going to do business with you.

[Speaker 1]
Well... You have betrayed everybody. I didn't betray anybody.

You're going to betray people from time to time, because that's just business.

[Speaker 4]
I just broke my contract. It's not really betraying. It's just clinging.

[Speaker 2]
You did that to the Fae, right? Yeah. So, really, that's for you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's a prank. More than anything else.

[Speaker 2]
That's a good way to look at it.

[Speaker 1]
And different people are going to... Among the Fae, you're going to have maybe some issues, but...

[Speaker 2]
But that's not a problem in this city. We'll probably say, good riddance. You're welcome anytime.

[Speaker 5]
Can we buy you a drink?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I'm just curious as to how the reactions to Lucent's shadow is going to be, because Esmars can get some weird characteristics. Lucent has a very bizarre shadow.

[Speaker 4]
Like a person following him kind of shadow, or his shadow's just fucked up?

[Speaker 6]
Be not afraid style shadow.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I wouldn't be worried. I'm not the only weird guy inside the entire city. Yes, and then...

Okay, so, where would you guys like to go first? And I should pose some things to you. There's the destinations that we've been discussing, and then, in general, if you want to find something inside of a city, you can either go to a place that has...

If you go to a place of business, then you're going to have to grease some palms in order to get information most of the time. If you go to a place of... If you go to a place of import or official...

How do I put this? If you go to a place of official capacity, the mayor's office, of barracks, the city watch, you need to have a connection or something that the person that people you're talking to want. And then you can always go to a bar, a hotel, a tavern, a pub, to get information freely at the risk of drawing...

At the certainty that you will draw somebody else's attention, friendly or otherwise.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. The Darklings. So when we were at the dragon hunt, you said you were surprised that we didn't go see the Darklings.

So we could start there, but we could also... What was it? What's the best course for looking for that dagger that you wanted?

[Speaker 2]
The Oniromancer. So we would need to find one of her lackeys first. So should we go to the Shackles?

I feel like that's going to be the most wait time. We can do that first and then do whatever else later until we get a response.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So the Shackles? What did the party consist of?

Like the one that's happening at night. What's going on there?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, the party. What kind of party is it?

[Speaker 1]
There's quite a few people who are displaying art objects. There was a recent interest in archaeology. Some artifacts have popped up.

Really recently, actually.

[Speaker 4]
Of course. Fucking of course.

[Speaker 1]
What's up?

[Speaker 4]
I said fucking of course. Archaeology.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Well, really there's been a number of fascinating objects from the south that have appeared. When I say the south, across the ocean.

I've never been there myself, but places where Yuan-Ti, the snake folk and their mummified ancestors.

[Speaker 4]
Is that where Kibi's from too? Does she hang out with snake folk?

[Speaker 1]
That's it. Kibi is from an island chain that is directly north. Right.

There's like Greece and then there's the Sahara right below it.

[Speaker 4]
Unless she's an island girl. I forget.

[Speaker 6]
Didn't you mention like the pyramid had something connected to the Yuan-Ti? Was that the Easter egg?

[Speaker 1]
No, that is correct. It does have... Yes, it is of Yuan-Ti origin.

It comes from the same... Sorry. What I said was it comes from the same culture that produced those mummies and the Yuan-Ti.

Interesting. That's interesting.

[Speaker 5]
And this is just a reminder for the Onuman that she doesn't take walk-ins so if we go into the shackles she won't take us immediately. She's not in the shackles. She doesn't live in the shackles.

[Speaker 2]
The shackles is where the Yan-Ti man was murdered. We have to go in the second room to find her people.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
To request an audience. Okay. That's her apartment.

Yaster.

[Speaker 5]
That's a nice name.

[Speaker 4]
There being an art thing is very... makes me very much want to steal but I'm not going to steal from this city yet. Not yet.

[Speaker 2]
Just give it time.

[Speaker 4]
Gotta give it time.

[Speaker 2]
I might set up here.

[Speaker 4]
If I play my cards right I might be able to set up in this place.

[Speaker 10]
Okay. Oh, nuggets.

[Speaker 4]
Party at the shackles. The party's not at the shackles.

[Speaker 2]
That's in the second ring.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, in the second ring. Okay. Party in the second ring.

[Speaker 2]
Got that. The shackles is also an inn, right? Or a hotel?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
So we could also park there if we stay overnight.

[Speaker 4]
There might be some thieves that have their eye on this party. So I think we should talk to some thieves first before we go to this party. Just in case.

In case they have plans that I want in on.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Do you mind... Actually, you know what?

I'll take a screenshot of your screen.

[Speaker 1]
And if they're thieves they might have what I'm looking for too. This will get uploaded to... I'm going to zoom out first.

This is getting uploaded directly to...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no. Never mind. I can't see the text.

[Speaker 2]
He's uploading it to Foundry.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm not uploading it to Foundry just yet, but I'm editing this as we go along. So if you want me to zoom in on something I'll do that. And of course...

Oh, I guess... Actually, no. I don't think I can with a virtual camera.

[Speaker 10]
Oh well.

[Speaker 1]
But yeah. If you want me to zoom in on something specific, then I can do that. I know that there's an Elven temple near the Drought Quarter here.

I know where the Wizard of Oregon is. And there is... Finally, I know that somebody mentioned this.

They're looking for a magic shop. Which there is. It's called Marker's Make.

And it is quite close to Corgan's Tower.

[Speaker 9]
Marker's Make. Strange name.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm.

[Speaker 9]
I feel like quite a, um... interesting person would've named that.

[Speaker 6]
Alliteration is a hell of a thing. Not always necessarily the best for naming, though.

[Speaker 9]
I mean, we can tackle these whichever order we think is best.

[Speaker 10]
Hmm.

[Speaker 9]
Do any of you have shopping you want to do?

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Yeah, I'd like to... Any place that has scrolls or that might have a magic rapier, Lirion will want to check out.

[Speaker 9]
And I have my Sunsign too, so... Shopping's probably the one we can get out of the way the easiest.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh! Here's one question. Is there like a...

So Lirion is a bladesinger, and I'm wondering if there's like a Bardic College here that might have like a bladesingery lore or weapons. If there might be an overlap with a Bardic College and not just the Wizarding School.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, a Bardic College. All of the Bard Colleges are actually inside of the Feywild. Incidentally.

[Speaker 3]
Fuckin' Bards. I knew there was a reason I went to Wizarding College.

[Speaker 1]
All of the, sorry, all the known ones, however. If you're looking for more like secret societies or anything like that, which Bards can produce and do produce on occasion.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we're gonna collect a garage Bard College, I'm gonna call it Nirvana. We're gonna be real big in about eight years.

[Speaker 5]
Beautiful.

[Speaker 4]
So we're, did I hear someone say we're going like shopping?

[Speaker 3]
Shopping first. Magic item shop.

[Speaker 10]
Magic item shop, that's my vote.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I wanna find some Gloves of Thievery, if that's a thing. My sleight of hand is severely lacking and I'm just training, so I need some training wheels. Just training.

My sneak is great and my sleight of hand is not.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you're training your proficiency in sleight of hand? No.

[Speaker 3]
And that gives you a bonus called Gloves of Thievery.

[Speaker 4]
I currently have one sleight of hand.

[Speaker 3]
But only for undoing locks and I think interacting with traps.

[Speaker 5]
It's really anything that's, no, no, it's anything that does with your.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Gloves of Thievery provide characters with a plus five bonus to sleight of hand checks. And checks made to pick locks. According to Google.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Which covers basically any kind of tool use or any kind of a tool based check that you're gonna use in order to get rid of a lock. However you choose to do that.

[Speaker 2]
Vimosa's gonna look for the lackeys while they shop.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, looking for one of the Oniromancer's lackeys.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. And I will be checking my money to make sure I can buy stuff. Okay, so off we go to a shop.

What shop would you guys like to go to?

[Speaker 3]
Are there many magic item shops? Whatever the nearest one is, or whatever the best one is.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's one inside. There's literally one inside of Sharros which is Marker's Make.

[Speaker 3]
Let's go to that one.

[Speaker 1]
There's like one chief one. So if something blows up that's not necessarily the end of all enchanting inside a given city usually there's somebody in a back alley or getting a startup together who will jump on the opportunity to fill a niche or somebody who's working you know somebody who sucks in comparison but would probably do well if given the if they had a better chance but Morgan's over on the side.

[Speaker 4]
Should I full hit dice by now?

[Speaker 1]
He's over this way. Karis?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I think I should. Where was Karis?

[Speaker 4]
I went back to the went back to the gate, saw that it was a shitshow and cut my losses and came back here.

[Speaker 1]
What is it? Half your hit points left and half of your and half of your hit dice from the Dragman attacks.

[Speaker 2]
We're on the same boat. Let's go. Slightly toasty.

Yeah, Mimosa did her job. She got the innocents out.

[Speaker 4]
Good. Yeah. I was only there because I wanted the tunnels to do smuggling with but that's kind of a bust.

Not anymore.

[Speaker 1]
It's open. You can totally do smuggling with it now.

[Speaker 4]
I could but there's armies there and I'm not getting caught up in an army.

[Speaker 1]
There's armies in one side but the shortcuts are now open.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well then I'll keep that in mind. Yeah. We'll practice your stealthing through them.

Mimosa and her can claim them. Help me train.

[Speaker 1]
One of them is nearby. I'm going to switch over to Sharrows and I'm just going to I don't know how you want to mark this on the map. I will leave it to you but one of the one of the shortcuts is by, not the Caves of Opal Gold, Shoal's Mine.

There it is.

[Speaker 4]
Shoal's Mine, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So that's close enough to I recommend marking that because you will forget where it is. Right. Shoal's Mine is like one or two kilometers to the east north.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Graffiti that mine.

[Speaker 4]
Shoal's Mine has a entrance to the gate portals?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. That would have been the one that you used. Anyways, I need to start building some D100s here.

I'm going to put you guys in Oh, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to export this briefly and then upload it so you guys can make use of it.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
I'm back by the way. Good news. The break part cost installation might be quite a bit less than it was before.

No way.

[Speaker 4]
They did this.

[Speaker 2]
That is awesome.

[Speaker 4]
I have to go in like half an hour and I'll be gone for an hour. Will you guys still be going in like two hours? I hope so.

[Speaker 1]
I'll be going until about 530 because whether I'm just hanging out or whatever if somebody wants like solo play I don't fucking care. I'm just going to be here until 530. And then I'll probably be back in here.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Because I love City Crawl.

[Speaker 4]
Don't go to that party without me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I need to what time is it? It's 1.27 so that means it's 3.13. Yeah. Now that's current.

[Speaker 8]
So it's Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
While I'm gone if you guys need to ask things I can type. There's that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. So you guys come across a city watch patrol as you guys are moving along and getting ready to move across the gate or move across the south bridge here. It goes directly across into the second ring.

And they're looking to basically to shift change for the city guard there. So there's the patrol and then there's the actual standard loadout or garrison for this particular gate. The watch for this particular gate.

And you guys are coming along and they ask do you folks have passes? I notice that you're coming from the coming from the interior here.

[Speaker 3]
Passes.

[Speaker 2]
Did our fine friend mad scientist tell us we needed passes?

[Speaker 10]
No.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa will remember that.

[Speaker 8]
So we'll lose some.

[Speaker 2]
Damn.

[Speaker 8]
Wait, we need passes to where?

[Speaker 2]
We need passes to get through the wall. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
You just Can we just sneak around?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, well.

[Speaker 1]
We're talking.

[Speaker 2]
We're not talking about sneaking right now. We are basically in front of the person. Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

I didn't realize that we needed passes. Where do we get those?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you can some of the guards look a little bit miffed at first because they're like how are you in this far without having those?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you know. She's just going to smile politely at them.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me a persuasion check.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Bat your eyes at them like trying your best. Hey.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was going to say that that is, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So that bumps up. What was the reaction roll? I think it was a 35?

34? 34. So that bumps it up to a 53.

Alright, alright, alright. I'm guessing somebody else somebody else probably let them in on the other guards says. The mage attending them, it's a young man, looks about the age about the same age as Johnny and Arthur, if you recall them from the Keep and from the Stinglass mages.

Nope. You don't? You put those poor boys You put those poor boys.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, those guys. Yeah, she would remember them. Yeah, once I mentioned the Once you mentioned the bullying and abuse, I got it.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god. Who? The guys you tormented?

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
This guy actually has a Stinglass crest. It's one of those compasses that has 52 points on it. They probably just came in with somebody else who did have the pass and whatever happened from there.

They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. The passes are about for the inner city, they're 200 gold apiece, and then for the second ring, they're 100 gold apiece, but you're already in the inner city, so if you have an inner city pass, you'll be able to go back freely.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, where are we in the circle? Are we in the center?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're in the very center.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I didn't realize that!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so that's where Jaster's apartment is, and that's where people whenever people have been teleported to a Sharrows, that's generally where they are.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, she's really good at remembering that. That jackass.

[Speaker 3]
How long do these passes last? Is it just for the day?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, for the day?

[Speaker 1]
They're for the year.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Is this the fiscal year? Does it end, like, next month?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 4]
So where do we file for an extension? Do we pay guards, or do we go to an official building for this?

[Speaker 1]
We can mint one here, if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yes, please.

[Speaker 1]
We have some plates and placards. Alright.

[Speaker 5]
Can we check?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if this is going to be too much to ask, but could we get replacements for our inner city passes? Or is that what the 200 is for?

[Speaker 1]
That's what we're doing right now, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, perfect! Thank you so much! You're so helpful!

She's gonna drizzle it on. Yeah, it's 200 apiece. Oh, perfect.

I've got that. If someone needs 200, I've got it. I've got plenty.

My fellows are 200, no complaints.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, Lirian's fucking loaded right now.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, Lirian is very, very rich.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well, then you can just pay for it, then.

[Speaker 3]
I could, yeah. Not gonna.

[Speaker 2]
I could. I'm also going to ask you to do that. That was me.

[Speaker 6]
Lucien's just gonna, like, go ahead and just hand over the side of the 200 gold.

[Speaker 4]
And I have the pass. I will add that to my inventory.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Do not want to forget that. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That's a good idea. Let me make a quick thing saying pass. What would that go under?

[Speaker 2]
Loot? Putting it under loot.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Have a Sharrows inner city pass. Don't lose it.

[Speaker 2]
Inner city.

[Speaker 8]
Pass.

[Speaker 2]
We'll just say Para has one. We can make her take 200.

[Speaker 5]
Let's you go back and forth between rings. Is it only between the second and middle ring, or is it throughout all the rings?

[Speaker 2]
It's throughout all the rings. We got the nice inner city pass.

[Speaker 5]
Yay.

[Speaker 2]
First class tickets. Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Let me just get a quick icon for this. Oh, right. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
What'd you find it under? What'd you do?

[Speaker 4]
Is the city known for anything?

[Speaker 1]
A lot of mushrooms. Oh. Besides partially incorporating lost technology and being built, it's a very nice city.

Even the quote like poor districts are just generally pleasant and nice. They're just not as flashy as the ones on the interior. Lots of parties.

Lots of... There's no... People here are like...

It's not like medieval starvation. If you're poor here, you're eating well, you just don't have a lot of money to your name.

[Speaker 4]
That's nice. That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Mushrooms are grown underground in these different chambers that used to be used for different kinds of water pumping functions, but there's no...

[Speaker 8]
A lot of alchemical reagents and a lot of fucking food. Nice. They take care of their people.

How generous. Interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Joked about me joining the Assassin's Guild. So that's a way that I could get daggered.

[Speaker 8]
We'll see.

[Speaker 2]
Also, if we have to kill one of these guys, we'll just send the body to that necromancer that we promised to give bodies.

[Speaker 1]
You mean the Mind Flayers?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, the Mind Flayers. We owe that guy a few bodies. If I have to kill one, we'll just send the body there.

We'll get rid of the evidence.

[Speaker 6]
Are you saying this in character?

[Speaker 2]
This is Nessie talking. Mimosa would never say this shit in front of Mixed Company.

[Speaker 6]
If the Mind Flayer gets mentioned, it's like we're protecting this Mind Flayer.

[Speaker 2]
This Mind Flayer is our buddy, our pal, our friend. I'd have to take notes. Also, it's an immediate way to hide evidence of maybe a murder.

[Speaker 5]
You know, he did say he would trade us information of artifacts for people's brains, right?

[Speaker 2]
It's not the...

[Speaker 5]
So like, you know.

[Speaker 1]
There's no moral clause here. I'm getting something out of it.

[Speaker 2]
He's a hired assassin who kills people. It's fine.

[Speaker 1]
While you guys are doing this, I see here somebody wearing holy robes walks by you, and they have a pack strapped on. They basically have an armor pack. It's a little bit like a miniature mannequin that you would keep armor and stuff like that on, but it's designed to hold a bunch of...

It's basically a modified backpack for holding your armor close and walking your way.

[Speaker 8]
A human, probably about 5, on the shorter side, about 5'4". Does he look to be official?

[Speaker 4]
Anything? Or is he just a merchant?

[Speaker 8]
They have a... Perception check. Okay.

All of us, or just whoever? Perception... My perception's not amazing.

Okay. 2118?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you notice that they have a few engravings on their... They have a few engravings on the top of their...

[Speaker 8]
They have a few engravings on the top of their pass that look like a lighthouse. And this person is...

[Speaker 1]
It has a medallion or an amulet that's both really on their person that is colored similarly.

[Speaker 4]
Any, like, gods that are lighthouse-flavored? Or whatever you said.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Actually, somebody can go ahead and make me... I would let Lucien make a...

Yeah, this is probably religion.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, good. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Anybody who has the religion proficiency, I would let them... I do not have religion proficiency. Right, but you're an archaeologist with a connection to this otherwise.

[Speaker 2]
You're an archaeologist that isn't proficient in history?

[Speaker 1]
I am proficient in history, however. Right. You do history.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, religion. I'm sorry. Still, though.

[Speaker 1]
He's more interested in historical knowledge, not gods.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, religion is history. Total of 32.

[Speaker 2]
Nice.

[Speaker 6]
I did use two scholar dice for it, though.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Still counts. Yeah, so there are a...

[Speaker 10]
It would have been really good.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
No, no, I was just saying it would have been really good even without the scholar dice. Right.

[Speaker 1]
Has anybody... By the way, has anybody else rolled? Or just...

[Speaker 2]
I've got minus one in all of those. Who else is not doing it? Yeah, Charis probably wouldn't know.

I mean, I came for funsies to see what it is, but that's a minus one.

[Speaker 4]
Is it a faith?

[Speaker 1]
I'll try for...

[Speaker 5]
I don't have any proficiency.

[Speaker 2]
I don't have religion.

[Speaker 10]
Not one, baby!

[Speaker 2]
Yeah! Sure. Maybe...

[Speaker 1]
Maybe it's for the best that I used the scholar dice. Stop rolling. Mine wasn't supposed to.

Let's see here. Lucent would know that there are certain eldritch entities that are referred to as Lighthouses that are more positive or beneficial to people and can do stuff and can bestow clerical powers onto them. And let's see here.

You would notice in particular that this was a... Remember when I said that you guys were literally right next to Lady Sene's apartment?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
She has a Lighthouse placard right above her basically indicating her residence.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we should tail him.

[Speaker 2]
That's a good idea. Tail him?

[Speaker 8]
We can ask him what's up with that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was thinking that one. Strike up a conversation. Hey, pal.

Is he going the same direction we are?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, she's going across the bridge here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah, Mimosa would strike up a conversation.

[Speaker 1]
What's your opener here?

[Speaker 2]
Hang on. I'm fighting a Play-Doh lid. Really freaking hard to get off.

What color is this Play-Doh? Magenta. Oh, okay.

Alright. Excuse me. Hi.

Hello. I just noticed your Lighthouse insignia. Do you work for Sene?

[Speaker 1]
Lady Sene.

[Speaker 2]
Lady Sene. Sorry. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, she's not currently seeing clients right now. Maybe there's something I could assist you with at some point?

[Speaker 2]
We can talk and see if you can help me.

[Speaker 1]
There's a couple things. I am fairly busy, but tell you what, I'll be at a I can see you're in the inner city here, so if you would like we could talk later. I'll be at these two places one later in the day and this evening at eight I'll be attending the new gallery across the river there.

[Speaker 2]
Will the archaeology one?

[Speaker 1]
One and the same, yes.

[Speaker 2]
I will be there too. I will see you there. My name is Mimosa Marigold.

[Speaker 1]
It's a pleasure to meet you.

[Speaker 2]
A pleasure to meet you too.

[Speaker 8]
What is yours?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Who do I have the privilege of talking to? Sorry, who?

[Speaker 1]
The person.

[Speaker 2]
The person.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Lady Violet. Lady Violet.

[Speaker 2]
She'll let her go.

[Speaker 1]
The two places that she marked were that she will be at the shackles around 4pm and she will be at the art gallery.

[Speaker 2]
At 8pm. 8pm. Okay.

Well, we know one for sure that we can meet.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, so we've got that. This was a twofer. We've gotten our passes.

We've gotten a meeting with one of Lady Sien's workers. And now we're on our way to shopping? Shop, perhaps.

[Speaker 2]
Well, yes. Alright, alright.

[Speaker 1]
You crossed the second That's funny. You come across and let's see here. Somebody make me a perception check.

Okay.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, who has good perception?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to up 11.

[Speaker 2]
I've only got a plus 6. I've only got a plus 6. Anybody beat 11?

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 10]
I think you're the highest. Good lord. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, you could hear somebody getting roughed up in an alley.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, she just turns and goes. Oh, well. Our passes are done and done, though.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we have them.

[Speaker 2]
We're good to do.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are in the second ring now. You are doing something else right now.

[Speaker 2]
She's going down an alley. She's seeing who's getting roughed up.

[Speaker 10]
I'll try to after you.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not being left alone.

[Speaker 1]
We'll also follow. There are six people here. One of them is a Two of them have some giant splod in them, pretty clearly.

One is a halfling. There's a second who's a gnome. And then there are two humans.

And they are currently roughing up somebody who's wearing a somebody in a hood wearing a mask that kind of looks like a gas mask.

[Speaker 4]
Can we see why? Should I roll insight?

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa was just going to start talking to them. Do your insight.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Not horrible. At least passes 15.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay, so you notice that one of the humans sorry, one of the one of the giant splod ones standing off to the side has a wound in their side and they're currently not participating.

[Speaker 5]
So I guess we should ask what's going on, but Excuse me.

[Speaker 2]
Why are you guys beating up this person?

[Speaker 1]
Piss off. None of your business. Doesn't involve you.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm going to ask again. It does now. Why are you beating up this person?

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to slowly back away. It's the bit.

[Speaker 9]
How many people are there?

[Speaker 2]
There's six people around one person, but one of the six is not fighting, and they just told the most to piss off, which made her mad. Okay. Do I need to roll intimidation?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you said that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I didn't even get enough. 32. Okay.

Good job.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I This guy attacked us I didn't mean to offend you, but this guy attacked us I gotta get to a doc at some point and we just gotta It's just private business.

[Speaker 2]
You should get to that doctor. Um Hang on. I don't have a potion.

Let me get my bag of holding.

[Speaker 4]
I think he's learned his lesson.

[Speaker 2]
Nope. Paris has all my day on potions. Um Yes you probably should get that looked at.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we intend to. I appreciate the concerned citizen routine, but I really do want to make sure that you guys see the person who's getting in the middle of getting beat up um he literally just vanishes from sight.

[Speaker 4]
Uh Was it magic? Did he drink an invisibility potion? Was it magic?

[Speaker 1]
He didn't move anything, just like they were holding him one moment, and then he teleported? Yeah, he vanishes from sight.

[Speaker 3]
Can I tell that magic was being cast? Because I do have counterspell.

[Speaker 1]
So do I. I mean Alright, fair enough.

[Speaker 8]
Oh So it probably wasn't a spell then.

[Speaker 6]
I think I know exactly what that was.

[Speaker 3]
What do you think it was?

[Speaker 5]
It was a soul knife.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Could have also been facedep, because he said he didn't move or anything. It was just one moment he was there, one moment he wasn't.

[Speaker 4]
We should look around. Anyway Yeah, we can Can I see if Can I look around and see if he appeared anywhere? Because gotta go somewhere.

Probably within view. Uh, go ahead and Would that be investigation or perception?

[Speaker 1]
Whichever you think is more appropriate here.

[Speaker 4]
13?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no signs of his passage. And we can't really hear anything, given all the cursing that's going on right now. So now the rest of the rest of these people have turned towards you.

They're wearing these outfits with let's see here a lightning bolt crossing three arrows and yeah, it's basically a lightning bolt crossing three arrows on their forms here. Thank you very much for interrupting us but do you have any further business here? Anybody else?

Like, get out of our way so we can go to a fucking doctor.

[Speaker 4]
You do that.

[Speaker 1]
Eh, fuck it. I can help a little bit with that. Don't, don't touch me.

I don't fucking know you people.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, goodbye.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and put yourselves on the Well, that went well.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Probably gonna have to think the token a bit. Do we know what I'm gonna miss within that hour that I'm gone?

[Speaker 5]
Probably just the shopping.

[Speaker 1]
Probably just the shopping, yeah. Alright, I'm Hold shift to, like, move your character into a space without, like, snapping into a group.

[Speaker 10]
Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, okay. And then there's another bridge that goes right across to Marker's Make here.

[Speaker 5]
I should shrink the token a bit more.

[Speaker 8]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Why does it keep double tapping it? Okay. Glad to know that shift does that.

I'm gonna get rid of my, um, health bar here, because we're not doing anything.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry about those things, it's just taking a little bit to get used to.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. You can also have your health bar so that people can see you hover over it. Okay, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry, don't worry too much about that. Though I do appreciate it. Pop out.

Now nobody can see you. Perfect. Okay, so you guys are going across.

[Speaker 4]
And these are the shops?

[Speaker 1]
These are some of the shops. Well, this is the magic shop that you guys were going to previously. So that's this little thing right here.

It's basically right across the bridge. Your characters are facing southeast there, so they cross and then they would on their right going this way to this building here. There's markers.

There's another guard patrol. You're able to show them your you're able to show them your passes. There's a gentleman and he's, uh, he's got two women with him.

All three of them are wearing new swords that have been, uh, nice little bows around the hilts and, er, basically around the hilts of the sword and the scabbards that basically tie them together like they haven't been opened yet. And you guys go across.

[Speaker 10]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
So Marker's Make is a it's an open opening lobby with a small kind of coffee shop in the middle there that opens up into a larger tower structure that's about five stories tall. And it seems that each story progressively, from the inside, when you look up, looks to get progressively larger as time goes on.

[Speaker 4]
It's like Sorcerer's Tundra.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, kinda like that. Yeah, fuckin' perfect example.

[Speaker 4]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Valyrian.

[Speaker 4]
Time to go find some gloves. Um.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, how do you avoid the snap effect?

[Speaker 1]
Hold shift.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, if you hover over token controls it tells you all the things that you can do. Well, the little square beside token controls.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yes.

[Speaker 4]
I'll keep that in mind.

[Speaker 10]
I like that.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I am gonna go but, um, will I be able to get those gloves or is that a thing that I should just wait until I get back?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, we'll let you know what the price is and then you can make a decision whether you want the gloves or not.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll keep, um, I'll keep foundry open, so I'll be able to, like, see out of character.

[Speaker 1]
You actually have a working relationship with this guy. I don't know if you remember, but you bought potions from him. Oh.

And, uh, he requires some materials from you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, can I, can I, can I do a favor thing? Can I get these gloves for a favor? I wanna be in- I think Charis is the perfect character to just constantly be in debt.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. That sounds about right. He seems like the one who, like, borrows to pay off someone else.

Yeah, yeah. He borrows several people to pay off several people. I think that's perfect.

[Speaker 1]
I will leave you with this teaser. He's going to request that you take over a nearby tavern inside the second ring.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh. Ooh, okay. Take over.

Take over as in commandeer? Or, like, it's empty so we own it now?

[Speaker 4]
You'll find out when you return. Alright, well. If you guys encounter thievery people, let me know.

Alright, bye. Bye, captain. Bye.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, um, so there's a gentleman in here named Ostris who introduces himself. He's wrapping up with things. Yeah, uh, how may I assist you today?

[Speaker 8]
I'm just wrapping up.

[Speaker 5]
I was wondering if you have anything like beads of force or just things that are good with restraint and all that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if you're looking for specific items, just go ahead and put the, uh, go ahead and write them down in the chat. Go ahead and write them down and leave them by the requisition form over there. I'll look at the ones on the top.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
And besides that, we will grab that opportunity to basically take like a ten minute break here. Woo woo. Which is really just going to be me getting my coffee and making coffee addiction.

[Speaker 7]
I have a boba.

[Speaker 9]
Alright, so out of character chat, I'm assuming he doesn't mean like voice overflow or any of that weird...

[Speaker 5]
It probably means out of character.

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone have like a blank in-character channel? Like I can't see anything. I click on jump to bottom and nothing happens.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, sometimes it will go just to out of character if you type in it. I think you have to be selected on your character. Yeah, otherwise it's like, ah, you mean out of character.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Yeah, so like if I drop para down somewhere.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Sometimes the opposite problem happens when you're trying to do something out of character and it's like, ah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Is there a way in Plutonium import to look at item descriptions before importing it? Or do you have to like import it in order to see what it is?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there's like a plus sign.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I just figured that out. Awesome.

Happened at exactly the same time.

[Speaker 1]
So the way I do this for most items is if you have a bunch of requests, I will put a I will put, I will just roll a d6 and see just for seeing what it corresponds to. Whether or not they have it in stock. And if they don't have it in stock you can request it.

Sort of like requesting a library book.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
I will tell you guys now if you're looking for an amulet of health or periopt of health or anything of health, it's not here. There are also no bags of holding or goggles of night or any of the other items that are requested like I did a hundred percent of the time for every single new character.

[Speaker 9]
And then...

[Speaker 5]
I'm just still selected on my character.

[Speaker 3]
How do you make a new line? Is it shift enter?

[Speaker 10]
Huh.

[Speaker 6]
I think this would probably be a good magic item.

[Speaker 9]
The boots of the winterlands. I'm also going to be looking for that.

[Speaker 5]
I made sure to leave out things that feasibly a shop would not have. Because there are a bunch of cooler stuff, however it's like, ah, no, a store wouldn't have that.

[Speaker 1]
You guys should probably do the opposite. Basically, all the things that get rejected from your character sheets are probably things that other people in the valley have. Or are kind of basically like bags of holding.

There are no bags of holding available because everybody has a fucking bag of holding right now.

[Speaker 2]
Haha.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I'll amend the list then.

[Speaker 3]
Yes sir.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
And back.

[Speaker 1]
Archery.

[Speaker 10]
Mhm.

[Speaker 9]
I'll end that, yeah. Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Try to get the list to be out of character chat. Yeah, there we go.

[Speaker 5]
That was an out of character. It just pops up even when I don't select the character.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if everybody has put their list down, but okay. I have not just yet.

[Speaker 6]
I decided to go for a bit of a weirder list.

[Speaker 9]
I just wrote down a list because they might have one of at least items in stock.

[Speaker 6]
Like House of Cards. Well, I don't have Tiny Hut, so I might as well get something to help with that. Removable Rods are always incredibly useful.

Lantern of Revealing.

[Speaker 1]
Again, can't really hurt to be able to find invisible creatures and objects. Pipes of Haunting. Fear is a very good condition.

Staff of the Magi is like an artifact, right? Like a legendary item?

[Speaker 10]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 5]
That's why I was like, eh, doubt it's there.

[Speaker 1]
Is it an artifact or a legendary item? It's a legendary. Staff of Power is very rare.

No, I'm just asking about the... Okay.

[Speaker 5]
No, no. Magi is just legendary. I haven't named any artifacts.

[Speaker 1]
What is the Mask of the Beast? It's something... You get three charges.

[Speaker 6]
Recharge 1d3 per day. And you can cast, I believe it was either Speak with Animals or Animal Friendship. Using a charge, it uses your Spell Save DC.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Cool. It does not require Attunement, which is a very nice thing. More information is not really a bad thing to have.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. There we go. That is our list of purchasable items.

And then for the scrolls that were required or requested, all of those scrolls are available.

[Speaker 5]
Requisitioned?

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean by requisitioned? You can request to have... You can request to...

You can basically pay half in advance to have it sent to this location.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that sounds good, yeah. Let's see here. Purchases of Archery, that's going to be...

Let's see here. The Uncommons are going to range from about 500 to 5,000. Let's see here.

The Rares... The Rares can range anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000. Very Rares can range anywhere from 25,000 to 50,000.

And I don't think there's any Legendary items.

[Speaker 10]
No.

[Speaker 1]
How about the Common? Is there a Common item on here?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, the Doublet of Dramatic Demise.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that would just be like... That would just be like 250.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, thank you. I'm going to assume it's probably sold out, but Clockwork Amulets?

[Speaker 3]
Are the scrolls priced according to Xanathars?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you could put that pricing in the chat, it would be fantastic.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so I can afford everything that I require on the list. That's good.

[Speaker 1]
Last item is the Clockwork Amulet. That one's a Common. Yep, so that would be...

That would just be like 250. Okay. Okay, so let's see.

[Speaker 5]
One Doublet, Decanter, and I can requisition the Shackles. I can afford all three. Neat.

Oh, the Staff of Power's on here.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on, what? What did you say the uncommon prices were? I just said the price for the one that you requested was 250.

I gave you guys ranges for the other ones. So I guess for the Decanter, what is that? Is that an uncommon?

[Speaker 5]
It's an uncommon.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that would be... The Decanter of Endless Water is going to be about 1,500.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
The Dimensional Shackles are not there. Wand of Magic Missiles, I think that's also an uncommon. That one would be 1,000 here.

Do we have everybody here? Because I don't want to go through these prices a second time.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
You know what?

[Speaker 5]
I'll start writing them down. So, Decanter is 1,500, and then the Magic Missile is 1,000.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Braceless Varchary, I think that's an uncommon. That would just be 750.

There's a lot of those going around right now. Let's see here.

[Speaker 9]
I don't think there's anything I could afford that would be useful to me.

[Speaker 1]
The Ring of Fire Resistance would be... Let's see here, that's also an uncommon. That one's 750.

[Speaker 9]
That's not rare.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Is it rare, or is it...

[Speaker 9]
I'm pretty sure it's rare. Yeah, it's rare.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, it's a... Ring of Fire Resistance, it would be about 5k.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, I can't afford it.

[Speaker 1]
Don't you have over 5,000 gold at this point?

[Speaker 9]
Uh, no, I have 3.6k. And 171 platinum pieces.

[Speaker 1]
You only have 3.6k? You know, the worth of platinum pieces is 10 gold per platinum piece, right? Oh.

[Speaker 9]
So that'd be... I don't know. I could barely afford it.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 5]
How much did he say it was?

[Speaker 1]
That would be just 5,000.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
At the moment, he's just chatting up with Charis about recent happenings. Because he kind of, yeah, it's just like and a magic mouth spitting out prices at you guys. Mask of the Beast, what is the...

Uncommon. What's the rarity of that? Uncommon?

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
You didn't mention the price.

[Speaker 1]
Give me a moment, please. Let me finish this up.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's why I stopped.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Um. The Mask of the Beast is 500.

But it has to be requisitioned. So pay 250 now.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. And then pay another 250 later. How's the cards?

What's the rarity on that? Also uncommon. It's basically like you can, it sets up a mini-shelter for 24 hours and then it holds back.

[Speaker 1]
What's his name? Kevin Spacey. Okay.

Yeah, that'd be that'd just be 500. Of course, it's fine. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I decided to go for a bit more atypical thing since you mentioned more of the common magic items being sold out. Go off the beaten path.

[Speaker 9]
I'd actually ask around.

[Speaker 2]
Is it safe to assume that he's got potions of healing?

[Speaker 1]
He doesn't sell many potions of that kind around here. What he can do for you is just kind of if you're an active customer I feel like I might have seen you around here before, but you're in good company. I could just requisition from the apothecary.

I think they're supposed to be coming over here in about an hour or so. Yeah. Have them bring over some potions for you.

[Speaker 2]
Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Then he goes back to chatting with Paris.

[Speaker 9]
I'd like to inquire about where I might find a periopt of wound closure and I'm going to slide him about 300 gold pieces for this information if he has any.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm not really a sage and also as I keep telling you, the DM, you're not going to find it in a shop and you're not going to get it for as part of a starting character. You could find it out in the world. But he says, ah, ah, like it passes along to a sage.

I know that there's some soldiers nearby who have some. Maybe you could take it off their hands.

[Speaker 9]
Very useful information.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this is the sort of thing that goes by basically the moment it goes out on the market. It gets bought up. Okay, the legend of revealing would be 2,500 gold pieces and the immovable rod.

Uncommon. That's going to be 5,000.

[Speaker 5]
Have you finished naming the price?

[Speaker 10]
I have.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, okay. What I wanted to mention is you didn't mention the price for Staff of Power. I did.

[Speaker 1]
25,000 gold pieces.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, thank you. 25,000. Oh, that is far above my budget.

[Speaker 2]
I was waiting for that to sink in.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, my brain probably skipped over it being like, oh, it surely can't be that high.

[Speaker 2]
You were writing it down and then you like connected.

[Speaker 5]
Oh dear. Well, hold on. Let me put all the prices in the character chat.

[Speaker 1]
And then did you put the Xanathar's prices inside the chat?

[Speaker 3]
I did a screenshot in Discord. I could type it out.

[Speaker 1]
Here, let me grab that cost. My standard is that they're about double the cost of, if they're getting sold, they're probably about double the cost of whatever it would be. The cost of making them.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think these are the scribing costs to make them if you know them. So it would probably be double these.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so like 5,000 for 4th level, 1,000 for 3rd level, 500 for 2nd level, 50 for 1st level.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. In general, just because I don't want to make a bunch of requests, but I might want to scoop up a bunch of 1st level scrolls.

[Speaker 1]
Are those... I tend to make those kinds of requests, by the way. I'm sorry for interrupting.

[Speaker 3]
No worries. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, so Lucent's just gonna go ahead and buy the Lantern of Revealing, the House of Cards, the Clockwork Amulet, Requisition, the Mask of the Beast, and all that.

[Speaker 1]
Dimensional Shackles, that could be... What is that? Rare.

So that'd be 5,000. What most people do once they start getting up into rare or very rare is they start trading out items, other magic items that they currently have.

[Speaker 6]
Trading, yeah. Bartering, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Do you want us to write out what our total cost is gonna be? Or just deduct it on our end?

[Speaker 1]
I would... After you deduct it, put it in the chat and somebody in the session reports can de-hook that if they want. Uh, yeah.

So I'm gonna buy the Lantern of Revealing, House of Cards, Clockwork Amulet, and Requisition, Mask of the Beast.

[Speaker 6]
So that's 250 now.

[Speaker 10]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
It's about this time that a... About this time that a lady comes in wearing, you know, pretty decent pretty decent clothes, not like super fancy or anything like that, but just well-groomed, well taken care of. Comes in and just kind of interrupts Charis and Ostrus' conversation.

It starts going back and forth with um, including Charis in the conversation but kind of ignoring everybody else. Just telling the two of them, What did you hear about the... Ostrus, I have the most delightful news.

You're not going to believe this about the murder by the shackle.

[Speaker 10]
Mimosa's ears prickle. Go ahead.

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa's ears prickle. She's laughing.

[Speaker 1]
She's like, um, Oh, what is it, Lenore? He goes, Oh, oh, do tell. No, he goes, I think.

I think. Okay, so we know that she was seeing some kind of um... We know that the handyman she was seeing, a poor, poor Rose, but she was seeing somebody off to the side um, and they told her it turns out that I found a note by her place signed with just a simple, like a simple I don't know, it was like an elf it must have been an elf name, I can't read Elvish.

As you well know, here Ostrus, but I was looking at the note and um it was signed it was signed in Elvish, but the message was in common about not coming to see him on the full moon, and so I'm betting and Ostrus kind of leans closer because she's pausing constantly like, yes? Yes, Lenore, what are you doing? It's like I'm betting a fairy slashed her throat open and he kind of like leans back looking a little bit disappointed and he's like, oh, okay a fairy that's the conclusion you came to he's like, yes, yes, because they like the full moon, they like moons that's when fairies come out to play you've lived here long enough and he's like, yes, yes, I understand I just wasn't really expecting gruesome murder to kind of coincide with, you know like one of our guests here he says pointing to Charis

[Speaker 2]
what? what? yeah, he also probably rolls her eyes towards the edge and is like, oh, crap come on I don't know what else it might have otherwise been I thought it was very exciting so what was it?

[Speaker 1]
Oh do lycanthropes exist in Simeid? Yes, for quite some time there's plenty of shapeshifters one of the reasons why people never really colonized the rest of the valley never made any great attempts to colonize the rest of the valley is there's an awful large number of shapeshifters out there shapeshifters I know of at least one Corrigan and I were discussing this about a week ago there's at least one werewolf tribe out there

[Speaker 2]
oh, interesting

[Speaker 1]
he was telling me about the wild hunt of the Nassus incorporates a few shapeshifters into their military structure, the troop or band, whatever you want to call it

[Speaker 2]
hmm, interesting

[Speaker 6]
Lucin is just going to go ahead and buy some oil as well

[Speaker 8]
yeah, for the lantern of course alright, yeah, he can do that for you

[Speaker 1]
it's around this time that a beggar stops by the door and kind of just knocks on it and Alice just looks over and says oh, oh, yes here for some coffee? and the beggar just silently nods and then signs something to Ostris who nods again and uh, let's see here do any of us recognize the sign?

Mimosa, in noticing Thieves' Cat would see that the uh him with the high passive perception would see a mark upon this gentleman's left hand which is missing two of his fingers, but he's signing and kind of compensating for the two lost fingers signing just we need to talk after um, we need, basically we need to talk tomorrow just coffee right now or just drink right now, but context clues is, uh, context clues is he wants the coffee

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 1]
feeds him some coffee, and uh pours out some coffee for him, and when this gentleman drinks the coffee, his appearance changes to that of a more common laborer

[Speaker 2]
well that's handy

[Speaker 1]
yes, yes, I don't know if you know this, but coffee beans roasted with dragon's fire or other dragon breaths I haven't really tried most of the other ones right now can act as similar to potions albeit with more temporary effects

[Speaker 7]
Hera's going to immediately try that with Bluey when she gets home

[Speaker 2]
there's your downtime action

[Speaker 1]
not nearly as portable, but hey in a place like this you don't really need to worry about portable okay, so, uh, I'm going to go recover my coffee, and then I want to know from caller, tell me what the party is doing next

[Speaker 5]
he's absconded hasn't he wonder how long the requisitional things would um, take to arrive

[Speaker 2]
um, Kerris Kerris is not here, damn it

[Speaker 3]
um

[Speaker 5]
I guess, what's the time in, right, in world right now

[Speaker 3]
the clock's going right now so it looks like it's 3 o' 7

[Speaker 5]
okay so we can probably visit the, the draw post for the, for checking out the knives that have been pilfered or whatever and um the Darkling thing, but also at 4 o'clock in world time, uh, there was that's also a meeting that you could do with the, what was it Lady Violet?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was either at the shackles, or since we've all decided to go to the gallery I can meet her at the gallery okay.

[Speaker 3]
That's Lady Violet? What's that about?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah um, we've been to the Neuromancer so we could get information from her that we could get that, you know, the Neuromancer might have but, because we can't talk with her right now Para's Quest and Mimosa's to an extent, but mainly Para's Quest and what are we trying to learn from the Neuromancer?

[Speaker 2]
How do we fuck up that thingy that horrible roast thingy up north send shivers down your spine shiver off yeah yes, that's one way of putting it shiver off so like how do we kill it?

[Speaker 3]
What's it vulnerable to? What do we need protection against in order to defeat it?

[Speaker 7]
Para knows a little bit and basically like, yeah it was become undead it's vulnerable because or the undead aren't vulnerable because they don't dream so I'm guessing we need some sort of protection for our dreams

[Speaker 2]
which is why we're going to the Dreammancer if you're Kelshattar, you're good to go I suppose

[Speaker 3]
okay so we're going here to hopefully get protection in order to be able to kill a shiver off

[Speaker 2]
multiple shiver off probably

[Speaker 3]
what can we do to defend ourselves against the weird dream attack?

[Speaker 7]
I think that's actually kind of the endgame boss too

[Speaker 3]
do we know do we know that we can

[Speaker 2]
it was a mummy though it was a mummy shiver off but like they're basically the same

[Speaker 5]
this one was specifically mentioned to need an army to defeat it

[Speaker 2]
well under the shiver off there's a bunch of shit that we're going to also have to cave out which is what the army is for

[Speaker 3]
like what we're trying to learn are we going to be asking about like are there any other weaknesses we don't know about one of the things we're interested in or do we feel like we know enough about that already

[Speaker 4]
how to defend ourselves

[Speaker 2]
so how to defend ourselves without making them dead to I think ask about it I just haven't had time to write in her journal in her great grandmother's and aunt's journal

[Speaker 3]
so there's like Violet at 4pm

[Speaker 2]
which we also need to investigate the murder

[Speaker 3]
alright investigate murder

[Speaker 5]
so are we meeting Violet at 4pm no

[Speaker 3]
we're not

[Speaker 2]
I don't I mean we have two options I was going to lean towards 8 because then we can figure out the murder and then be like hey look we solved this for you

[Speaker 3]
the murder is going to help she wants us to do murder investigation

[Speaker 2]
I don't think she does but if we solve the murder of one of her employees and we bring that to her my guess is we'll be able to see her we'll actually be able to see her because we've done a huge favor for her

[Speaker 3]
well I thought we already we already know we're going to see her at 4 or at 8 right no no no

[Speaker 5]
we're seeing one of her strongest workers Lady Violet

[Speaker 2]
we can't actually get to the Oneromancer we can't get to her because she's reclusive and she stops seeing people I see so if we solve the murder

[Speaker 3]
we bypass Lady Violet and get right to the Oneromancer and get more hype

[Speaker 2]
that's at least my thoughts yeah if we do this huge favor for her then she's like okay I'll see you also I'm guessing the moment we drop the like shiver off thing she'll probably be like okay that's really dangerous let's go but solving the murder will be a huge favor to her

[Speaker 3]
okay so Lady Violet at 8pm and hopefully murder persuades her to take us to the Oneromancer

[Speaker 2]
yeah

[Speaker 3]
investigate murder before 8pm do we want to do the cold iron investigation speak with thieves there's a beggar on the second ring speak with Moira that was to investigate like sourcing additional anti-fae weaponry do we want to do that yes

[Speaker 2]
we can probably wait on that one until Frogitzer gets back

[Speaker 3]
okay we should leap to the murder investigation then

[Speaker 2]
yeah if no one else has anything

[Speaker 5]
I missed part of what was said so can you just run me through what we're doing

[Speaker 3]
so there's two threads there's an Oneromancer thread and then there's get anti-fae weaponry thread and the thought is anti-fae weaponry can wait we're going to focus on the Oneromancer thread for now and the Oneromancer thread starts with us solving a murder and then later tonight meeting up with Lady Violet and trying to leverage the murder solve into getting face-to-face time with the Oneromancer

[Speaker 5]
okay so after we after we attempt to solve the murder then talk to Lady Violet and then hopefully maybe get an audience as it were with her then we go on to the anti-fae weaponry which is dealing with the drow and darklings thing

[Speaker 3]
yeah and that thread involves the tips we got were speak with thieves there's a beggar on the second ring and to speak with Moira at the shackles okay

[Speaker 5]
and that can help with

[Speaker 2]
okay the thieves and the darkling can wait until Froggoth gets back yeah you do

[Speaker 3]
so if we're going to do the murder thing do we know a location do we know any key NPCs

[Speaker 2]
she was killed right outside of the shackles

[Speaker 3]
killed outside of shackles how long ago

[Speaker 2]
I don't know how long ago let me see

[Speaker 3]
not minutes ago I'm guessing

[Speaker 2]
about two weeks ago yeah I just read it two weeks ago no word from the morgue yet so we could cause some trouble in the morgue if we want to cause chaos

[Speaker 3]
okay so we could go to morgue we could investigate

[Speaker 2]
the shackles any witnesses who saw her leave saw what happened

[Speaker 3]
witnesses and evidence divination, do we have any access to divination spells I don't really have, I have more like blasty blasty combat stuff

[Speaker 7]
I don't know if Pera's with you but she does

[Speaker 6]
lots of combat stuff from Minos

[Speaker 2]
Pera would be with us Pera's with us

[Speaker 1]
Pera can be with you guys Pera teleported, basically teleported people which is the only way of them getting back

[Speaker 2]
oh

[Speaker 1]
yeah I had them teleport to the caster department

[Speaker 2]
yeah okay well

[Speaker 3]
so this, so Para could maybe give us divination magic

[Speaker 2]
I don't know who Para is

[Speaker 3]
what was the name Pera like Pera

[Speaker 2]
okay so Pera's not with us okay can I have her teleport to us

[Speaker 1]
yeah no she could just be here now like she was doing something else

[Speaker 2]
but mostly uses her Santa hat to do a message to Pera saying please come over here sweetheart you've got needs you've got stuff and it's no fun solving a murder without you okay

[Speaker 3]
so so far our leads on the murder are go to the morgue and try to get more information investigate the shackles and like canvas for witnesses or like look for evidence and then we have divination magic from Pera

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 3]
any other any other clues or tips we have related to the murder

[Speaker 2]
well apparently a fairy for whatever that's worth

[Speaker 3]
that the perpetrator is thought to be a fairy

[Speaker 2]
no well that was the gossip

[Speaker 1]
so this lady Lenore came in and started gossiping yeah

[Speaker 2]
we do know that she got a note from possibly a lover or boyfriend or whatever saying not to

[Speaker 1]
she was seeing somebody

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 1]
i just never found out who but when yeah the note the message was in common and it was saying not to come out on the full moon

[Speaker 2]
yes

[Speaker 1]
it had the perfume on it so of course how could she resist but

[Speaker 10]
yes

[Speaker 2]
so whoever she was seeing didn't want her to come see him on the full moon do we know if two weeks ago was a full moon i suppose that's something to figure out too

[Speaker 3]
is there a reason to think the lover's letter is connected to what was the name of the person who was murdered

[Speaker 2]
rose lady rose i think

[Speaker 1]
the last two full moons were on oh sorry not the night the last full moon was on the 12th so almost exactly two weeks ago i'll just put that as a note uh

[Speaker 3]
okay uh okay so the party is going to investigate the murder of lady rose we want to meet up with lady violet at 8pm

[Speaker 1]
seems to be the case yeah but i've saved that note in the calendar so now it's visible for the uh

[Speaker 3]
well the moon phases are already there

[Speaker 1]
that's what i used to place it aha okay tell me of your decision where are you guys headed to

[Speaker 3]
uh well we set off for para is para here

[Speaker 2]
yeah para can be here now

[Speaker 3]
okay let's do para stuff before we go out

[Speaker 2]
so the murder we're going to the

[Speaker 3]
oh you want to go to the shackle we'll go to the shackles what spells does para have does she have divination spells yeah she's a cleric

[Speaker 7]
and i just prepared all the divination spells that i can find nice

[Speaker 1]
oh yes

[Speaker 7]
which is like popped out at fourth level divination do clerics have legend lore oh they do i didn't think it would be useful because for some reason in my head it was like well surely you can't just legend lore like some guy

[Speaker 1]
it depends on the guy mhm the fact that you mentioned legend lore now makes me suspicious well i think of i'm thinking of divination spells of which there are not many i was trying to remember which ones are uh

[Speaker 7]
oh yeah i guess i could filter by divination

[Speaker 9]
the spell divination

[Speaker 7]
uh yeah sixth level there's also true seeing there's find the path um i don't think find the path would be like useful in this specific case yeah if you don't list a specific location it fails i have scrying i have commune commune could be i guess useful maybe

[Speaker 6]
contact other plane

[Speaker 3]
do locate object if the killer took a trophy maybe

[Speaker 8]
locate creature if we think it's a werewolf yeah

[Speaker 3]
okay do you want to do any of those or do we want to start like talking to people at the shackles or

[Speaker 7]
um i mean we might as well start talking to people at the shackles because i can do those basically anytime okay

[Speaker 3]
okay

[Speaker 7]
and i mean if we go and talk to people we might find more information to narrow down questions that we might ask

[Speaker 2]
ooh yeah

[Speaker 7]
because the more often you cast a lot of those the less likely it is to be accurate so

[Speaker 2]
okay so to the shackles

[Speaker 7]
to the shackles we go

[Speaker 1]
okay so you guys walk over to the shackles takes you about another 15 minutes here you only have to cross one you only have to cross one bridge and you're entering from the east side Moira is here as is Lady Violet is at this point no no no she hasn't gotten here yet it's about 3.30 you guys are right over here you guys walk in and Moira Moira's just at the bar she's dealing with the last of Lunsrush just kind of ordering her new just kind of ordering her new hirelings around as well as a few a few of the artificers as well as a few of the artificers and apprentices that Ormaran left behind here she's very excited to see Para

[Speaker 8]
hello hi how's everything going

[Speaker 2]
pretty good what about over here

[Speaker 1]
I like the new outfit I don't think I've seen you with that cloak before but it suits you you look awfully severe for such a small creature

[Speaker 2]
doesn't she

[Speaker 1]
I would say it offers you a great deal of charm thank you so what can I help you folks with you have quite the troupe are you looking for work

[Speaker 7]
sort of already on a job um we were looking for information on that murder that happened over here a couple weeks ago

[Speaker 1]
oh dear some of the patrons do gossip yes yes um well we could speak probably in one of the old we'll speak in Ormaran's workshop

[Speaker 10]
yes

[Speaker 1]
take the elevator up those of you who have not been here before which is nearly all of you the shackles is pretty high tech compared to everything people are leaving their weapons by the door into just like a vent that goes into nothingness a purple violet nothingness

[Speaker 8]
whoa

[Speaker 1]
sucks everything in and when people leave they name the item that they're looking for and reach their hands in and take it back out the elevator here is disconnected completely from the building it has a couple of gates between it so nobody accidentally falls in but there's just a soft hum and sourceless light that eventually closes it, not quite fiberglass, no, what am I thinking of basically those neon lights, fluorescent yeah fluorescent is the word I was looking for just kind of like these fluorescent bars atop the roof of the elevator sorry, the ceiling of the elevator passing this light and it's just a soft smooth hum taking you guys upwards to about the fourth floor she steps out grabs one of her keys, plugs it in and then to up past the attic space which is more open than planned area and a workshop where a number of different apprentices are working however since your I miss your known friend but I hope he's doing well

[Speaker 7]
we saw him recently

[Speaker 1]
you did?

[Speaker 7]
yeah, he was frozen in time, I think

[Speaker 1]
interesting well that means he's not dead, so that's quite the relief I hope he gets better soon

[Speaker 7]
I do too the amulet he gave me is pretty useful

[Speaker 1]
useful man I miss him here just about every day though he did put the apprentices to work in a suitable fashion, I died fairly unfriendly at this point so about the murder yes there was a woman here who was murdered about two weeks ago, she was found out back quite near the dumpster and it's a space between the dumpster there's an access hatch for one of the nearby mushroom farms to get some of our some of our goblins from that particular farm it was rather nasty her throat was slashed open I'm told never saw the body but the guard did a fair job of cleaning things up

[Speaker 2]
oh, so did anybody see the body?

[Speaker 1]
the guard a couple of my patrons I escorted my patrons inside through something like a tribune basically do party games to keep everybody distracted or discreetly it was let's see here if I'm recalling correctly it was Derek who saw, who found the body and reported it to me he's currently he's currently staying at the hotel actually but he was just doing it while so he's waiting for some renovations to finish as long as house in the city districts

[Speaker 3]
what time of day was the body found?

[Speaker 1]
oh it must have been about 2pm or sorry, 2am hmm where did they take the bodies?

[Speaker 7]
to the morgue, yeah?

[Speaker 1]
yes, there's a morgue it's towards the north end of the city on the third ring I'd recommend taking the ferry or one of the boats up was there so like so was there a jaw smashed or what happened? well I'm told that the head was too heavily damaged to you speak with dead or any similar similar spells something about the rest of the body was left untouched but I'm told it was something of a fairly grisly scene oh grisly scene, what are we doing?

[Speaker 7]
hi I'm here we didn't want to do your quest without you oh thank you okay well a grisly scene would certainly line up with a werewolf whoever was the murderer they're taking cautions werewolf?

[Speaker 4]
can someone catch werewolves?

[Speaker 7]
okay so we got a we got a tip

[Speaker 2]
that she got a note from her lover to not see him on the full moon and she died about on the full moon

[Speaker 10]
oh no

[Speaker 2]
but whoever gossiped this claimed that it was a fairy who slashed her neck open oh

[Speaker 3]
the gossip was that she got a letter from her lover

[Speaker 2]
yes

[Speaker 3]
and that the contents of the letter were

[Speaker 2]
don't see me on the full moon she is Rose

[Speaker 3]
the victim

[Speaker 2]
who worked for the evil Neuromancer oh well um

[Speaker 4]
you're talking about this murder victim and a fairy pops up laughs

[Speaker 7]
well this gossip happened with the fairy

[Speaker 2]
yeah they're listening to the gossip okay

[Speaker 3]
can we get leads can we get leads on her lover did she know anyone

[Speaker 2]
here did you know Lady Rose well?

[Speaker 1]
oh Lady Rose I mean she was a handy woman did you know Rose well? sorry no she mostly kept to herself

[Speaker 4]
alright does she have a house anywhere in the city

[Speaker 1]
that's not really information that I have ask some of the patrons I'm sure she might have spoken with one of them

[Speaker 2]
would we also be able to talk to Derek

[Speaker 1]
yes yes he's in

[Speaker 2]
oh I wasn't going to bother him why he's a key witness

[Speaker 3]
he saw he reported the body he might have put the body there

[Speaker 2]
I guess we could see if he's okay to talk about it well yes we'll start with that I just didn't want to re-traumatize him

[Speaker 3]
I'm all for re-traumatizing this person if it helps solve the

[Speaker 2]
whatever it takes

[Speaker 4]
who is it that we're traumatizing

[Speaker 2]
Derek the body

[Speaker 3]
Derek is the one who reported the body I think they're a patron and not a guard

[Speaker 4]
yeah a guard's a different person what race is Rose is she a human, drow, elf

[Speaker 5]
do we have information do we have information on the lover besides the lover no

[Speaker 2]
not yet so we are going to have to wait here until 4 o'clock to ask Lady Violet those questions

[Speaker 8]
okay so

[Speaker 3]
what should we be up to in the meantime is Derek here let's talk to Derek

[Speaker 5]
poor man

[Speaker 2]
he'll be fine

[Speaker 1]
he's currently staying on the second floor will you all be needing accommodations tonight

[Speaker 2]
most likely okay because there's a Nessie to the party there's that thief that's going to be talking to what's his face tomorrow I don't remember his name the shopkeeper oh yeah what happened with that he came in used thieves can to ask for a drink that changed his appearance and said that he needed to talk to him tomorrow

[Speaker 4]
well then we'll be here tomorrow

[Speaker 2]
oh also brewing coffee

[Speaker 7]
with dragon fire like fire breath turns it into like basically a potion-y thing so Para's going to make coffee with Bluey's fire, or Bluey's electricity and gonna give it to someone random um you can give it to

[Speaker 2]
Monk would drink it

[Speaker 4]
um did uh let's see oh right um would I have gotten my gloves for a nice favor

[Speaker 1]
yes okay so that was the last thing is he wants you to take over a little bit of a hostile takeover of an establishment in Europe it's not quite a thieves guild it's uh there's a gentleman named Rupert who recently had some severe financial troubles with the mushroom industry and is now looking to diversify his assets

[Speaker 7]
uh hey is that that guy that Mimosa was on a job for and then she got kidnapped yes

[Speaker 10]
oh my god

[Speaker 4]
was that the hold on was that the that was Citron's party was that the one where we did a caravan of mushrooms yeah okay

[Speaker 1]
some of the mushrooms started running off after you guys went into the Feywild yeah

[Speaker 2]
well serves him right let's go take over his shit yeah he started

[Speaker 1]
investing into a family business that's attempted he's trying to push them into the enchanting business and he wants you to find basically some uh by any means necessary but suggests that you could probably blackmail the family into like having you take over the business or or just financially cripple them

[Speaker 4]
alright so take over uh what kind of business is this tavern kind of business

[Speaker 10]
this is a tavern yeah

[Speaker 4]
tavern business

[Speaker 2]
we're doing this for the mushroom guy

[Speaker 10]
no

[Speaker 3]
the target

[Speaker 2]
okay okay okay the name of the target

[Speaker 3]
Rupert

[Speaker 2]
dickhead mushroom guy okay

[Speaker 1]
dickhead mushroom guy is funding these people and working with them to try to turn it into an enchanter to try to bring some mages in uh so it is it is the Sawil family

[Speaker 4]
I could spell that absolutely that's something that

[Speaker 2]
no just kidding Sawil okay the

[Speaker 4]
and uh what about this family

[Speaker 1]
there's a mage named Giovanni that they're bringing in to try to start an enchanter

[Speaker 2]
we gotta run them out of their business

[Speaker 7]
who wants us to do this

[Speaker 1]
funded by Rupert Shades and uh Ostrus McElmire the mage who runs uh markers make

[Speaker 4]
um alright so the Sawil family what do they have to do with this

[Speaker 10]
we're trying to stop them

[Speaker 1]
okay you have to mess with either their mage their business or their new funding

[Speaker 4]
and the mage is Giovanni

[Speaker 1]
yes

[Speaker 4]
okay can you write a little thing okay hiring yes

[Speaker 1]
yes and he has given you the um he has given you the he's given you the Gloves of Thievery for the purpose of completing this task and provided

[Speaker 2]
that you

[Speaker 1]
okay provided that you complete it by the end of the month he will let you keep them and he will let you keep the shop

[Speaker 4]
oh oh like the

[Speaker 1]
not the mage no not his mage enchantment thing but like he will let you keep the establishments awesome

[Speaker 4]
fuck yeah that's awesome

[Speaker 1]
alright yeah it's basically a strongholds and followers establishment

[Speaker 4]
alright so um where is that switch over here

[Speaker 6]
it's only fitting that the archaeologist helps the group get into shady business so if they get into shady business why not join

[Speaker 4]
and the mage is turning it into like an enchantment thing right

[Speaker 3]
well Rupert is changing it into an enchantment thing he's bringing in Giovanni yeah Rupert is the source of money Giovanni is the source of magic

[Speaker 1]
and the surreal family is basically the source of connection

[Speaker 4]
do we know anything about this family

[Speaker 3]
they're the mark

[Speaker 4]
green griffin green griffin

[Speaker 1]
okay so I'm going to put that there and that's uh it's a family of elves okay so in the meantime you guys have been getting ready to talk to Derek he opens the door he's a little bit groggy a little bit glassy eyed you can smell booze on him but he's cheery when he opens the door oh more visitors okay

[Speaker 2]
you've had visitors

[Speaker 1]
yeah well the city guard has come back a few times to ask me what's going on and then of course I have my you know my construction company is uh I'm getting some renovations done that's why I'm staying here and kind of enjoying the nightlife uh yeah you don't look like other those two oops so how can I what can a businessman do for you

[Speaker 2]
we wanted to talk with you about the uh the murder that took place two weeks ago

[Speaker 1]
his face falls a little bit oh yeah

[Speaker 2]
can we get you some lunch? some food?

[Speaker 1]
uh yes actually I was just going to order from the dumb waiter here

[Speaker 4]
um is he emotionally is he scared or does he when he hears that we're here to talk about is he scared or just ugh

[Speaker 1]
make an insight check

[Speaker 4]
okay

[Speaker 1]
my description was that he's actually a little bit cheery yeah no he seems um he's kind of happy to talk with some relatively normal people about this

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 1]
we are definitely normal people

[Speaker 10]
definitely

[Speaker 3]
don't be suspicious don't be suspicious

[Speaker 1]
yes okay um it was rough

[Speaker 3]
did you know that well

[Speaker 1]
rose uh no she just kind of kept her kind of kept to herself didn't really fraternize with other people sort of around the bar on occasion but just kind of kept to herself

[Speaker 2]
so you didn't see her with anyone

[Speaker 1]
oh no no I definitely saw her with people but um you know she just kind of kept to herself

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 3]
did she have uh anyone she talked to regularly

[Speaker 1]
anyone that she talked to regularly uh she talked to when she was ordering drinks she would talk to um and then there was the doorman she would talk to him often and they were friends and she knew at least one of the cooks and at least one of the one of the handymen around here that she would meet with and there was uh she was friends with an elf nearby yeah elven man or woman she mostly kept to herself

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 3]
uh the handyman uh do you know who that was rough description

[Speaker 1]
oh the handyman it's one of the gnomes who works here nickname is clocks

[Speaker 7]
um do you know anything about the elf

[Speaker 10]
uh what elf

[Speaker 7]
the elf you mentioned

[Speaker 1]
oh um nah I can't even green clothes that's the that's the best I got green clothes and long hair couldn't tell if it was a he or she or whatever

[Speaker 2]
hmm did you see what she was doing on the night before she the night she died

[Speaker 1]
mostly keeping to herself um and then she was dead that was uh yeah it was it was almost unrecognizable the way the body was

[Speaker 3]
torn up where exactly did you find the body

[Speaker 1]
no I found her behind the dumpster and um it's I found her behind the dumpster by a hatch that goes to the nearby apparently to get goblins will from a mushroom farm nearby and that's one of their their hatches to the farm it's one of the places where they offload product or start shipping it I've had some it's not it's really not bad

[Speaker 6]
so I'm gonna spend two sorcery points to cast detect thoughts I'm not gonna pry deeper which means it won't so I'll only get the surface thoughts but it means I won't get detected um cause I have a funny feeling there we go again not prying too deep just just surface thoughts don't want to get detected

[Speaker 10]
okay yeah

[Speaker 1]
um he's just thinking like oh man really really torn up it's a shame I didn't know her she mostly just kept to herself it's just kind of those two things looping over and over again

[Speaker 5]
okay so man

[Speaker 2]
hmm do you know the name of one of the cook that she hung out with or talked to or anything about him

[Speaker 1]
oh the cook um and you hear him think the uh just briefly you hear him think the cook is the pretty sure the cook is the same elf that she was sometimes seen here I'm pretty sure the cook and the the finder the finder elf are the same person back to like no just you know occasionally chatting when one's when her shift would end is usually when around when his shift would begin so yeah we just kind of chat whenever she was around here

[Speaker 6]
and so what was the thoughts I kept hearing

[Speaker 1]
the thoughts were for that section when he heard about the elf when he heard about the elf was oh the elf and the cook are the same person oh okay gotta keep that in mind

[Speaker 2]
I I'm sorry you said go ahead you said you found her behind the dumpster did you see anyone or anything off or around the area

[Speaker 1]
I saw I was I definitely saw the guards cleaned this up and they they told me that it wasn't a thing but I definitely saw some like big animal prints going towards the going towards the cellar on the other side

[Speaker 2]
does this thought match up with what he's saying

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna assume you're very very much whispering that to me I'll just I'll do this

[Speaker 2]
I don't know you're detecting thoughts I was just asking James for your benefit

[Speaker 10]
you can

[Speaker 6]
pretty much be assuming that I'm going to be using telepathic speech to be relaying information to you

[Speaker 2]
sure and then

[Speaker 1]
are you let's see here are you still probing his thoughts are you probing deeper or just normally right I am not going to be probing deeper I'm just going to keep

[Speaker 6]
reading surface thoughts I'll be relaying information yeah yeah to the rest of the group using telepathic speech basically

[Speaker 1]
yeah pretty much the same thing that he's saying now

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 3]
what do you think the guards would cover up the animal tracks

[Speaker 1]
no I'd probably just stop some panic in the town everybody's kind of high strung right now and with the you know with the army marching to the Seder stall I don't think anybody really wants to think about monsters inside the city you know it happens they are around it's just they tend to really only affect people who are absent or separated from everybody else in some way

[Speaker 7]
kind of like Rose

[Speaker 1]
yeah I mean she mostly kept to herself does anybody else have any questions

[Speaker 7]
Pera's going to ask if any of the people he's seen with Rose I guess I can ask in character of the people that you've seen with Rose do you still see them around

[Speaker 1]
she mostly kept to herself there weren't really a lot of people to see there but yeah on occasion

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 1]
like I said so Moira's here they didn't speak often but except to talk about getting drinks and stuff and then there's the I don't think I've seen the elf around that she was with and then you hear another thought which is I think the elf and the hook are the same person and it's gone I don't like it

[Speaker 6]
like I said I've been rolling the information I've been getting to the rest of the party using telepathic speech because that way it's pretty silent

[Speaker 7]
okay well thank you for your time

[Speaker 1]
yeah always always did you guys want some did you guys want some food here

[Speaker 2]
that would be nice

[Speaker 10]
I think that was delightful

[Speaker 2]
yeah we've got time

[Speaker 1]
so who are you guys exactly what are you here for I think I've heard of some of you but I just don't

[Speaker 2]
oh who did you hear of

[Speaker 1]
everybody around here knows Parra I think they like who specifically

[Speaker 5]
would you look at that aww

[Speaker 2]
what did little Parra do he's really proud of her good job

[Speaker 7]
I have an entire army that probably lives here

[Speaker 10]
yeah

[Speaker 7]
this is where your army is ah that makes sense

[Speaker 1]
no this is not where the army is the army is further up north oh yeah

[Speaker 8]
that's where I aspire

[Speaker 1]
which is the reason Sharos is not currently frozen over

[Speaker 2]
I see little Parra's also I think a lot of Parra's

[Speaker 7]
early questing was done in Esheros

[Speaker 8]
that is correct

[Speaker 7]
I also realized that the green on this map is not in fact the water

[Speaker 8]
that is also correct if you look at

[Speaker 1]
is my camera still on yeah I'm using OBS virtual camera so that's the green is like the actual read

[Speaker 7]
that makes a lot more sense than how I was reading it

[Speaker 5]
did you think they were just floating on water

[Speaker 7]
yeah and then I realized that those weird things connecting them are bridges

[Speaker 1]
like these weird elven gate things I'm actually not sure it kind of looks like a drawbridge but I'm not entirely sure so maybe it's just facing the wrong direction it probably is this is probably supposed to go or something I don't know that's probably exactly what it's supposed to be yeah

[Speaker 8]
mystery solved

[Speaker 2]
Mimosa will introduce herself as Parra's aunt

[Speaker 1]
oh yeah that's pretty interesting you two don't look very alike

[Speaker 2]
very proud of her she's done a lot of good here

[Speaker 1]
absolutely and you're Mimosa yes

[Speaker 2]
I am yeah

[Speaker 1]
yeah I feel like I heard about you hmm

[Speaker 8]
huh

[Speaker 1]
the hell I heard about you somebody mentioned you to me actually I think I had somebody ask about you

[Speaker 8]
oh who who

[Speaker 1]
who it was a gentleman who just kind of plainclothes worker I wasn't really expecting him to see him in the inner city but I think I ended up oh that's why he knew me he was probably working on the renovations of my apartment they have a lot of people going in so you know my estate there it needs to be it needs to be fixed and I wanted my wine cellar fixed up so they were working there as well

[Speaker 10]
doing a pretty good job

[Speaker 1]
of it but yeah just a plainclothes worker had a had a bunch of tattoos though mostly on his hand yeah I remember you you worked with a few caravans down south and some of those people actually ended up coming coming back up north and and bring a few technological goods which was cool to be honest with you

[Speaker 2]
that is cool

[Speaker 1]
yeah that was the last thing I remember I grew up with a warden I think I know a few I grew up with a warden actually I didn't grow up in Esherus I grew up in Bronloch there was a guy there who ended up turning a lost his father for a little while

[Speaker 10]
oh yeah

[Speaker 1]
yeah his father was just gone because they kept doing expeditions into the Cloud Forest but we've reconnected recently and I guess we found his dad

[Speaker 2]
yeah we helped with that Mimosa and I did I'm so glad you remember Otter that's awesome yeah

[Speaker 7]
yeah that was like the big Cloud Forest quest that we did

[Speaker 10]
a few of the rest of you

[Speaker 1]
are new to me but I know Dr. Basha here heard a few things about you from the Drow quarter I want to say yeah just people interested in what was it there was those and I had a representative from Grodbok Thule that I was talking to recently trying to negotiate for a few warp pieces

[Speaker 5]
May I ask what you heard?

[Speaker 1]
that just that somebody was interested somebody was expecting you at a party you were on a guest list at some point yes can I also inquire what the man asking about me wanted to know oh just if you were he said that you were asking for him and to let him know if he if I saw you and he didn't leave a name?

[Speaker 4]
no

[Speaker 1]
that was a little weird yeah I just completely slipped my mind

[Speaker 2]
you know what why don't you tell him that you have seen me

[Speaker 1]
I'm supposed to go back to my apartment tonight to check things out so I'm sure I'll have an opportunity to speak with him or at least write a note

[Speaker 2]
yeah yeah uh you can just tell him or say that I'm staying here at the Shackles for a few days yeah

[Speaker 1]
yeah that'd be perfect

[Speaker 2]
thank you very much

[Speaker 1]
alright I'm gonna I'm feeling a little bit tired but

[Speaker 2]
oh yeah yeah yeah you've been a huge help

[Speaker 1]
thank you

[Speaker 2]
perfect thank you so much stay safe

[Speaker 1]
Lucent during this time his thoughts have been completely blank for the previous like the past 5-10 minutes of conversation yeah by now I probably ran out because the tech thoughts only last for a minute

[Speaker 4]
when we get far enough away

[Speaker 1]
when that thread of conversation started his mind went completely blank

[Speaker 10]
that's odd oh

[Speaker 2]
no oh oh see here's the thing

[Speaker 7]
he was repeating the same phrase over and over again which is something that we have seen a lot

[Speaker 2]
oh really yeah

[Speaker 6]
she was programmed wasn't she

[Speaker 2]
his memory was programmed

[Speaker 7]
yeah it happened with Sol Greger Sol Gregory it happened with someone else too and I don't remember exactly who we saw it with

[Speaker 2]
Zephane I don't know if there's someone in between

[Speaker 7]
ah yes Zephane that's the other one I was thinking of okay

[Speaker 2]
which is Alford Memory yeah I can't remember who that is so his memory is Alford

[Speaker 5]
I guess you could try the Great Restoration unless it's the really strong one

[Speaker 7]
which would not help it's probably the really strong one

[Speaker 2]
darn I think it is the strong one the only reason we fixed Sol Greger is because we fucked with time huh

[Speaker 6]
time heist

[Speaker 2]
oh yeah we rewrote history we rewrote time

[Speaker 10]
it's fine it's whatever

[Speaker 2]
it's all good

[Speaker 5]
just rewriting the fabric of the universe no big deal

[Speaker 2]
we did it I think a couple times

[Speaker 6]
I'm sure rewriting I'm sure this will not have terrible terrible consequences that will echo throughout all of existence

[Speaker 2]
it hasn't yet

[Speaker 1]
that is completely correct it doesn't because that's generally what happens with when you mess with time the small t time gets wrapped up into the gets wrapped back into the big t time oh well you look at that

[Speaker 10]
let's see how this explains it

[Speaker 1]
thanks god there's no that's somebody doing it there's no there's no such thing as the butterfly effect where you move a chair and now Hitler is president

[Speaker 10]
that's dumb thank goodness

[Speaker 4]
when we get far enough away I will just kind of say so the cook

[Speaker 2]
so the cook also that man's memory was messed with

[Speaker 4]
yes

[Speaker 6]
something tells me that every time that little cook thing appeared in his mind that was probably a mental cue then yeah a little pre-programmed sequence

[Speaker 4]
should we talk to him or send someone to spy on him

[Speaker 6]
if we know there is a trap probably spring it the threat of a trap is lessened greatly by simply knowing about it it's still there of course

[Speaker 2]
hmm alright so we're gonna go talk to the the cook the chef the chef

[Speaker 1]
you will not because it is not his shift he's not around

[Speaker 2]
he's the night shift damn it

[Speaker 4]
and what time is it now what is sixteen o'clock

[Speaker 1]
it is four so oh

[Speaker 2]
we have to go downstairs and talk to Violet

[Speaker 7]
yeah because we at least have the beastie prince

[Speaker 2]
yeah and we can see if she can confirm that elf and cook are the same or if they have or if Rose stuck to herself yeah

[Speaker 1]
okay so Lady Violet is uh she is downstairs she's just briefly saying hello to some of the uh some of the patrons she's not getting a lot of uh not getting a lot of responses people are mostly just kind of avoiding her

[Speaker 2]
oh is she keeping to herself

[Speaker 1]
no she's like doing the opposite she's like

[Speaker 2]
I know I couldn't help it um yeah but most people say hi

[Speaker 1]
oh uh thank goodness okay I wasn't uh wasn't really expecting to see you here

[Speaker 10]
oh

[Speaker 1]
but uh yes haven't really made I haven't really been making much progress with patron I just wanted to figure out if there was uh any any next of kin we hadn't yet uh we hadn't yet spoken with or otherwise even a chance to say goodbye or at the very least confirm the body

[Speaker 2]
oh for Rose

[Speaker 1]
yes

[Speaker 2]
I have a few questions about that we're kind of looking into it seeing if we can help

[Speaker 1]
right okay that's uh generous of you certainly

[Speaker 2]
um was she close to anyone she frequently

[Speaker 1]
visited I know that she frequently visited this area and suspect that she had a lover nearby

[Speaker 5]
do you know anything of the lover or is it just speculation

[Speaker 1]
uh it's all speculation at the moment I couldn't even get a correct answer on whether there was one or more or like gender or anything but we did get I know that the perfume smelled like peppermint okay

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 1]
sorry I wish I had more to uh I wish other of us had more to go off here

[Speaker 2]
that's that's helpful

[Speaker 1]
have you spoken with any

[Speaker 2]
it does help

[Speaker 1]
witnesses here

[Speaker 2]
we just got done speaking with one but I don't know how I hope ah

[Speaker 1]
what what is it spit it out what is it

[Speaker 2]
he has eyes to think okay his mind was altered his memory was messed with son of a bitch oh

[Speaker 4]
does that sound familiar

[Speaker 1]
no it's just kind of what I was expecting given the difficulty we were at you think of all the magic that we have access to and why we wouldn't solve a murder right away yes and the answer is generally more magic

[Speaker 2]
yeah we did get some tidbits from him but it was

[Speaker 6]
rough and also there's a natural suspicion that said tidbits may also just be part of a pre-programmed sequence

[Speaker 2]
so we're gonna try to validate them solidify them

[Speaker 1]
I see and what did you what did you learn here exactly

[Speaker 2]
uh that possibly the cook on night shift might very very might be the lover we need to check it out

[Speaker 1]
night shift cook

[Speaker 2]
who is an elf

[Speaker 1]
there is no night shift cook in here I was here the night of the murder I came to investigate the night of the murder there is no night shift cook so this could just be

[Speaker 5]
like every day or specifically that day would have been

[Speaker 1]
two weeks ago it was on the 12th of this month

[Speaker 2]
yes

[Speaker 1]
do you know if

[Speaker 2]
do you know if there was a cook before that night

[Speaker 1]
the night shift no no there wasn't I took inventory of the staff

[Speaker 7]
okay so that was just the pre-programmed

[Speaker 2]
that bit was we don't know about the elf well from that note

[Speaker 5]
why would there be programming to add a person who clearly doesn't exist

[Speaker 2]
to send us off the track

[Speaker 6]
red herring yeah because what if someone with access to mind accessing magic comes along and tries to solve this well you plant a little

[Speaker 2]
anyone's gonna ask about it yeah we did hear that she got a note from her lover not to see him on the full moon and it was signed elvin okay stop buying him it was signed in elvin is that what you're saying yeah it was written in

[Speaker 10]
elvin's script

[Speaker 1]
elvin's script

[Speaker 7]
it's the same thing to para she's not smart

[Speaker 5]
elvin's script covers stuff like i think fey and sylvan as well

[Speaker 1]
correct yeah they use elvish characters like gnomish and both use the same characters but the different languages

[Speaker 5]
like latin is to every european language

[Speaker 1]
there's a so at this time a bunch of guards walk through there's three watchmen there's well yeah it's heading towards the evening but not quite yet there are five five men walk through one of which is a sergeant and they're followed by a man in finer clothes that has a few sycophants nearby just kind of hangers on along with a bodyguard and they're entering at the same time the the man in finer clothes whispers to the sergeant and does anybody have the observant feat i think it lets you read read lips

[Speaker 2]
i don't think mimosa does

[Speaker 9]
i do not i was wondering no i actually

[Speaker 5]
i don't think i've even heard of that one no i think i've

[Speaker 7]
thought about it but i figured my perception was high enough already

[Speaker 2]
pretty good feat stealth a little close eavesdrop

[Speaker 7]
sure

[Speaker 1]
you get a little bit closer switch headphones here but yeah you guys get a little bit closer and or you get a little bit closer like right in the middle of the sentence just making sure you take him out there to be a big fuss about this he's had a stressful time i'm sure we could get in contact get him in contact with some representation of just a place to hold him safely you know and the guards like yeah understood all the guards here have really thick really thick like gloving on and clothing it's like they have cloth over their studs sorry cloth over their chain that almost looks like it's built to handle kind of like dogs if that makes sense

[Speaker 8]
like dog trainers

[Speaker 1]
and they go upstairs immediately

[Speaker 2]
mimosa will like covertly do the hand like come on we're going to the group

[Speaker 5]
can't hold on

[Speaker 2]
i'm just double checking something real quick or she can follow them and see what they're doing i think i can make a guess or two about what that's just vision

[Speaker 8]
okay yeah as good arcane i only sees sight not sound right i'm back okay i was wondering does arcane i also include sound or is it just site did you put it in the chat and see what it says okay let me actually do not do not just vision alright eyes don't tend to have ears pity

[Speaker 2]
alright should i stealth up or mimosa had planned to stealth up okay i will yeah

[Speaker 7]
para will not stealth up she will just stay down here what are you guys trying to accomplish here

[Speaker 5]
i see what's going on nosy yeah i'll stay down cause too many people on the stairs will attract attention

[Speaker 1]
right and are you guys so the guards are taking the elevator up

[Speaker 2]
oh and if they're dragging them out i guess we can just stay and watch

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 2]
is there not stairs nope we're not going to get there in time yeah even if it

[Speaker 1]
oh sorry i should specify no there are stairs on the back side right it's like an emergency

[Speaker 7]
exit which is how i think they just said that they wanted to take them out

[Speaker 4]
through the back yeah okay well then let's let's go there sneak and like stay in an alley and kind of peek behind peek around yeah all of us on top of each other looking at looking around the corner

[Speaker 8]
around the yes exactly that yes

[Speaker 1]
excellent perfect so it's about 15 minutes later you guys see as a you guys see that this gentleman is taken out back and he doesn't resist he doesn't put up a fight he gets roughed up anyways and gets dragged out back into the alleyway he is currently chained in silver handcuffs

[Speaker 2]
hmm well i mean that answers that but do we want to let them take him

[Speaker 4]
i mean they'll figure it out in a month

[Speaker 2]
i mean they know what he is i'm saying like do we want to let the guards take him or do we want to intervene i don't know why we would intervene

[Speaker 4]
but yeah i don't know i don't think we should i think he'd be a kind of well not outmatched but like we don't want the whole city guard on us

[Speaker 5]
yeah they probably in all fairness they might have better wizards who can solve the issue they were talking about like keeping him safe hmm punch in the face was probably a bit unnecessary but you know

[Speaker 2]
yeah that's why

[Speaker 1]
they have loaded him onto a boat and are going onto the canal at this point

[Speaker 2]
oh god i at least want to know where they're going so that we can break him out if we need to is there any way we can do that quickly

[Speaker 1]
there's a prison you guys just know there's a prison on the north end

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 1]
that will indicate now oh charles here we go

[Speaker 2]
okay well we can break him out of prison if we need to

[Speaker 7]
did we know where he was living

[Speaker 2]
yeah he said it multiple times i didn't write it down though

[Speaker 1]
he's in the inner city yes

[Speaker 2]
inner city

[Speaker 7]
cause that guy he was supposed to give a message he won't get a message if he's over there

[Speaker 2]
i know mimosa's a little bit mad about that we can also ask well we could just go that's what i'm saying we can ask i forget her name i want to call her mod i don't think that's it moira yeah we can always ask moira where exactly he was staying and then we can go there

[Speaker 4]
i had to ask her something anyway didn't i

[Speaker 2]
about the thieves right right

[Speaker 4]
i was very tempted to just sneak onto the boat but i don't think that's a good idea definitely not

[Speaker 2]
no

[Speaker 6]
yeah that seems like a poor choice yeah

[Speaker 2]
he's at the i'm sure when we find the real werewolf you think there's that's not the right guy

[Speaker 4]
i don't think that's the right guy

[Speaker 2]
i yeah they could have messed with his memory to keep him there but i don't know

[Speaker 4]
but who's protecting this werewolf is this werewolf also just a magic user protection

[Speaker 7]
well we know he went down the hatch

[Speaker 1]
do you know any of this call her assist the party whoever's acting as a caller at this moment oh phineas is muted oh no

[Speaker 3]
okay so let's just recap so we're all like on the same page about what's happening um the original person who discovered the body was mind altered we found someone who we believe is a werewolf being taken away by the authorities right by the city guard

[Speaker 1]
they were the city watch it was a sergeant one sergeant and then four basically footmen

[Speaker 7]
and it was the same guy that we had just been talking to

[Speaker 1]
yes they took away derrick

[Speaker 3]
they took away derrick in silver handcuffs um okay and so what we don't know so uh speculation derrick is the person who killed rose

[Speaker 7]
at least that's what the guard thinks

[Speaker 3]
right um so the original purpose of the murder investigation and then tell that to lady violet so that she'll be impressed and take us to see the anaramancer do we still want to go through with that plan do we think we have enough to impress lady violet

[Speaker 2]
uh i mean i don't my mouse is not really satisfied she wants to can we

[Speaker 3]
she wants to what hold on i want to hear more of that what did you want what do you want to do

[Speaker 2]
he wants to investigate further and like be for day i'm sure that derrick is the killer like but i don't know if we can talk to you know he could have been but it's not by choice

[Speaker 1]
they're just going to a prison

[Speaker 2]
yeah that's fine

[Speaker 1]
he's probably not going to be accessible in holding

[Speaker 2]
oh oh no no no no that's not okay let's go get him

[Speaker 3]
why do we want to get him

[Speaker 2]
because we can't break him out

[Speaker 3]
why do we want to break him out

[Speaker 1]
he's not going to be accessible you're not going to be able to come visit him at least for a little while

[Speaker 7]
i mean okay didn't moira say she brought him inside afterwards if he was the werewolf then

[Speaker 2]
he wouldn't have been not a werewolf outside she her mind could have also been altered because she said she brought him in to do a trivia night with everybody else

[Speaker 3]
well at some point the moon might have been obscured right the particular mechanics of when this guy was or wasn't a werewolf i mean if that were

[Speaker 1]
you guys have a lot of information around this right now that's like unknown

[Speaker 3]
yeah so the main question is do we want to pursue um trying to figure out whether derrick was the real killer

[Speaker 2]
yes i do

[Speaker 3]
i will mention

[Speaker 5]
though that remember how it said she was gored pretty badly when brought in did anyone mention if derrick was covered in blood or the like we can go ask her

[Speaker 2]
and see if her mind has also been altered yeah because i can read her mind would have would have every patron patron in the

[Speaker 5]
you know bars mind being altered because unless he cleaned up outside uh they would have definitely seen blood or something on him yeah but there's

[Speaker 3]
a question as to how dispositive that evidence is right like even if he didn't kill her he might have gotten blood on him yeah if he like saw her and like so

[Speaker 5]
something like

[Speaker 3]
help yeah like suppose she says yes he was covered in blood right does that tell us that he's the killer i don't know um

[Speaker 7]
when i do have divination spells we could do it that way

[Speaker 3]
yeah yeah so we could do

[Speaker 7]
ask god

[Speaker 3]
so are we all on the same page about like pursuing whether derrick is the killer does everyone want to do that or does is there anyone who wants to do something else

[Speaker 4]
i'm along for the ride let's do it

[Speaker 3]
say i'm here okay cool um okay so the evidence that we so we've got more witnesses we can interrogate and we might discover that there's been more mind altering going on is there anything we want to do about the mind altering i

[Speaker 2]
don't think there's anything we can do about the mind altering right now except for check to see if they are mind altered okay because

[Speaker 3]
in that case because that's like a hard stop for us right like if there's a mind block and we can't remove it we don't get access to the evidence that it's obscuring

[Speaker 2]
at that point mimosa would want to see if we can still find something off of the body at the morgue

[Speaker 3]
okay so we have so we threads we have the morgue we have further we also have derrick's resident like derrick's room yes that we could search oh

[Speaker 2]
yeah

[Speaker 3]
um

[Speaker 2]
the room in his house

[Speaker 3]
yeah because there's a question as to if he is a werewolf how long ago is this a recent thing or has he been a werewolf for a long time

[Speaker 2]
we could also see if we can get a bit of his handwriting and double check that he wrote the note we don't have the note though i know but we have to find the note i

[Speaker 3]
mean the note could be false right because derrick a fairy

[Speaker 1]
i'll tell you right now right now you guys are just kind of going in circles which is fine but

[Speaker 4]
um do they have evidence gathering places like do they have a place where they load all the evidence that they found at the scene do

[Speaker 3]
the guards have that yeah

[Speaker 1]
kind of like a watch station yeah

[Speaker 4]
they would if they have the evidence we could if if we can't find you guys have already

[Speaker 1]
collected a ton of evidence and some which is contradicting each other that you guys haven't actually uh kind of falsified any of them which i think is what happened i want to say i can't actually when was the last time this happened we were just we were just talking about uh

[Speaker 6]
do you mean the the previous session where everybody kept waffling over decisions

[Speaker 1]
um that might have been it

[Speaker 3]
so we've got a couple options explore derrick's room question more witnesses uh go to the morgue go to the city watch and look for evidence and explore the um uh explore the cellar that he said there were animal tracks going to

[Speaker 4]
is the cellar close to us because we could check that out is under us okay

[Speaker 2]
we could check that out and then head to his apartment

[Speaker 3]
we say apartment we're talking about the room that he was in in the shackles yeah yeah

[Speaker 2]
yeah we can go to his apartment later that's a

[Speaker 3]
sidebar okay so cellar let's go to the

[Speaker 1]
cellar right um you're going to the cellar

[Speaker 3]
yeah his testimony was that he saw tracks to the cellar i thought he said like across the way at the like goblins

[Speaker 1]
the mushroom from there

[Speaker 3]
yeah so i think that's the cellar that we're we want to investigate okay

[Speaker 1]
so when you guys say the cellar you do mean the uh you mean like the mushroom farm area right

[Speaker 3]
yeah yeah it seemed like he thought there was like a hatch that the animal tracks were like going toward and disappearing into that was my interpretation of his testimony so i'd want to go look for go out to where her body was found by the dumpster look for the hatch go investigate the hatch

[Speaker 1]
yeah so there is a hatch there yeah there is a hatch there um and it is presently it is presently locked which would i

[Speaker 2]
can i pick the lock

[Speaker 1]
yeah and you would just succeed at that um

[Speaker 4]
okay carrots is hovering over you

[Speaker 8]
watching what you're doing

[Speaker 1]
okay yes you guys are able to uh to go in it's a fairly clean or i should say clean it's owned by a goblin um it is it's a fairly like musty and messy area there's like little spores growing all over the walls and all over the steps here along with like moss that's like some underground

[Speaker 5]
lichen i love moss mild flashback to the time got infected by spores i'm just not having a great time with this yeah carrots is covering her face with like oh yeah

[Speaker 4]
i'm getting something out of my disguise kit and just like put it over my face

[Speaker 5]
like i remember times when there was mushrooms around just like covers his mouth or something

[Speaker 6]
uh seeing his companions start uh you know covering their mouth and reactions to mushrooms lucid will do the same

[Speaker 1]
all right all right that's fine

[Speaker 7]
carrot has no issue with mushrooms

[Speaker 5]
yeah she didn't get mind winged it infected it was an exciting exciting time yes carrots remembers the fear oof

[Speaker 4]
mushrooms

[Speaker 1]
okay yeah so you guys make your way in you guys make your way in and there is just uh there's another door there's some mushroom beds nearby there's a there is a goblin who's in the middle of like tending to his mushrooms he's sitting next to a distillery and processing uh processing mushrooms

[Speaker 2]
oh can he see me vanessa

[Speaker 1]
his back is currently turned towards her

[Speaker 2]
okay can we just like quickly look and see if there's prints paw prints anything

[Speaker 1]
uh sure and somebody go ahead okay one person make me a perception check one person make me an investigation check

[Speaker 7]
i will do perception i will do

[Speaker 1]
investigation and i also need one person to make me a nature check

[Speaker 5]
nature check

[Speaker 3]
of 12 i will use three of

[Speaker 5]
my scholar dice you will be much better at that

[Speaker 6]
thank god i used my scholar

[Speaker 1]
dice okay and then liran do you have any other bonuses that you want to apply to that

[Speaker 3]
um i have scholar dice like it's an intelligence sort of thing it's definitely

[Speaker 6]
that by the way investigation check got a 22 all right now i

[Speaker 1]
right now i'm looking right at it uh okay para you look around you don't notice any active blood but you know that this thing would have been swept up you don't notice any active blood but you can see you can also see that the area has not been clean thoroughly in in any way shape or form so maybe maybe the prince might have faded but anything that would have been here wouldn't necessarily have been cleaned up lucent you're looking over at the different mushrooms here along the sides there's no there are no cracks in the ceiling to have um you basically confirm that there's no blood on the ceiling there's no evidence of detritus or any kind of like struggle or anything nearby there's no sign of passage going in and then um finally i would relay all this information

[Speaker 6]
to the rest of the party using telepathic speech god knows that will one day come in very much handy

[Speaker 1]
and then lyrium you look around you recognize the types of mushrooms that are that are within the area and you know that these spores tend to if they have been fed blood they will grow red and they have to be physically removed in order to in order to stop them from spreading spreading redness throughout and you actually do see a you actually do see a slight trail of red that goes back behind and goes to a just runs into it okay you see a trail of red spores and mushroom bedding or moss bedding that goes down the stairs and hooks left it goes it's not on the same side as the goblin and it just runs if you peek around the corner you see that runs straight into a wall

[Speaker 4]
oh boy

[Speaker 1]
there's a few mushroom beds on that side there's like a there's like two levers and two chains for kind of hoisting these um for for hoisting these beds have you guys ever seen one of those one of those book holders where that's like a wheel they could turn it to look over multiple books

[Speaker 5]
oh those ones yeah yeah

[Speaker 1]
it's like that mechanism but for mushroom beds

[Speaker 10]
ha okay

[Speaker 5]
fascinating

[Speaker 1]
the goblin is going to wrap up his his task in the next two minutes

[Speaker 3]
the nature was boosted to a 23 by the way yeah

[Speaker 1]
no i saw that so that's why you spotted the red trail something something was bloodied

[Speaker 4]
recently and then what do we do about the goblin

[Speaker 8]
do we follow the red trail yeah

[Speaker 4]
uh the goblin though um we can say we fell into a locked cellar into a locked cellar you know how it is oh this isn't the bathroom um

[Speaker 5]
it's the back room

[Speaker 4]
yeah can we knock him out before he sees us must

[Speaker 2]
i could i suppose

[Speaker 3]
can we just charm him

[Speaker 2]
i have a girl if you want me to try to incapacitate him you don't want to kill the man

[Speaker 1]
or if he's hour and 15 minutes left so if you guys want to make progress use spells do something okay you've made some decent progress already but it's like if you want to if you want to end the saturday session with more answers than questions

[Speaker 7]
wow wow darkness upon you

[Speaker 4]
are there any other rooms in here that i could like cast a minor illusion in have them

[Speaker 2]
by wrapping up his business is he going to leave do we know

[Speaker 1]
30 seconds left but yes there are places where you could like try to cast a distraction

[Speaker 4]
okay well then i'll do that um but we should probably hide really quickly um sure

[Speaker 1]
you are in a place that is just completely visible

[Speaker 4]
oh is it our dude can we go back up the stairs really quickly or is it a ladder

[Speaker 1]
thing i'm just gonna do

[Speaker 6]
it fuck it

[Speaker 4]
okay that's not the right thing sorry

[Speaker 1]
see here my

[Speaker 6]
god i'm going to use resources to get that get this session continued

[Speaker 1]
so thank you that was that was good all right so you guys have a minute you you round the corner like i said this uh this red trail just leads to a um just leads straight into a wall

[Speaker 2]
all right check it for yeah investigate the wall for yeah quickly

[Speaker 5]
how small is the gap in the wall there is no gap in the wall

[Speaker 2]
no we're checking to see if it's like a secret passage yeah don't you have a thing

[Speaker 3]
for that it's a 19 result investigation a bunch of people have things that

[Speaker 6]
they just buy or bought um i'll give you my fuck my lantern revealing use it quick

[Speaker 1]
okay reveals an invisible

[Speaker 6]
button as soon as that goblin reappears i'm just gonna cast management okay

[Speaker 3]
poor rat can i can i just polymorph him into a uh no into a rat or something he'll

[Speaker 1]
remember if you want to ask questions right now do you want to like get stuff done we've i pushed

[Speaker 2]
the button i already said i pushed the button

[Speaker 1]
uh you hear a click on the other side and you see a um it is revealed that this this wall is actually illusory in the process which lyrium would have figured out anyways but you see a bunch of traps retracting

[Speaker 2]
oh wow all right let's go let's go let's go yep let's go

[Speaker 1]
you're in a hallway that um yeah so now you're in the hallway there's a bunch of this this red trail continues it goes to a t intersection and there is a placard in uh that's written in sylvan who here speaks sylvan

[Speaker 5]
me harris i read a

[Speaker 1]
bunch of people okay uh there's a note here it says the darklings have taken up resident opposite our warrens leave them they've agreed to leave us be if we leave them be

[Speaker 5]
mm have taken residents opposite our what

[Speaker 1]
warrens it's another word for like a cave or either either cave or like underground structure is sometimes how it's used

[Speaker 4]
and who is our

[Speaker 1]
by the way if

[Speaker 6]
as the full minute went up did he stay gone by the way no

[Speaker 1]
shame he's not aware of anything he's just like oh i kind of blacked out for a moment blacked out for a moment there

[Speaker 4]
that's good um okay so there's we're at

[Speaker 1]
this is next to an active mushroom distillery so like it's not the most surprising ah a little bit of moonshine strong match exactly all right are you guys going left or right towards the darklings or towards the or following the trail goes to the the trail goes to the left and the darklings are indicated on the right side which is a little bit one of these is closer to the shackles on the left and on the right side is further away from the shackles

[Speaker 4]
um i'm curious about the darklings but that's not why we're here

[Speaker 2]
oh yeah the blood yeah do we see the trail still or does it fade off by here

[Speaker 1]
nope it continues to the left it's just a matter of are you guys following that

[Speaker 2]
downwards no i'm following the blood yeah and most of us stay in on the werewolf track

[Speaker 1]
it takes you guys down some stairs and then shows you a large cavern that is that has been carved out it's similar in shape to a cathedral there are some bits of technology from the shackles above that are almost plugged into the ground like a charger if you will and there's some bits like you know some columns that were clearly supporting the shackles that have been drilled into the earth here and locking it into place but otherwise there's a lot of stonework around here and it's primarily moonstone hmm everything has a faint glow to it it's a little bit uh trans the edges of your being are ever so slightly translucent here and is it a full moon uh no it's a new moon mistake and there are several large butterflies here butterflies or moth like creatures that are just kind of floating about and when I say large they're not really large in size they're more like small in size which is really fucking big for a butterfly or a moth obviously but uh yeah there's a bunch of butterflies and or moths that are about the size of a that are roughly the size of a dog

[Speaker 4]
just kind of floating about huh okay in the center of this cavern

[Speaker 1]
I'll give you this last description there's a walkway it's not a stairway it's kind of a walkway that goes around in a spiral shape around this cavern which goes down fully about 50 feet and in the center of the very bottom of this cavern is a man who has from this distance you can't really tell too many details about him other than you can see a faint bit of red near his head and he looks to have been posed on the table in the center

[Speaker 10]
hmm

[Speaker 4]
should we sneak down there? see what he's up to um

[Speaker 7]
sneak is not my strong suit

[Speaker 4]
I can fly down and get a like hover over him uh sneakily

[Speaker 5]
you can check out what's up with this guy

[Speaker 4]
I'll roll a

[Speaker 5]
stealth stealth it may or may not be incapacitated

[Speaker 4]
I'd like to see this man up close see what's going on

[Speaker 1]
okay describe to me how you're getting down to this man I know that you're flying but

[Speaker 4]
oh um I'm gonna quietly kind of flutter hover over him as close as I can get without feeling like I'm gonna draw alarm

[Speaker 1]
so he's in the center of a wide room right so you can I'll let you you can sneak down and then sneak back up pretty easily like by just kind of hugging the pillars and avoiding where you think you might be seen but there's no way if somebody is looking at this if somebody is looking at this body there is no way to hide from

[Speaker 4]
they know what to do in that case

[Speaker 5]
I know what to do one second I can just okay it's not working please imagine that invisibility has been cast on you because then you can go into the center

[Speaker 2]
it's not appearing but I don't know why click concentration if it's a concentration thank you

[Speaker 5]
it was probably when I was checking the 24 for

[Speaker 4]
nope that was white what the fuck I hit the wrong one sorry hold on um perception

[Speaker 10]
12

[Speaker 1]
sure so you go up to him you notice that the blood is a little bit of blood that is pooled around this gentleman's neck from two puncture wounds in his neck is actually still kind of around like it's still circulating from the puddle itself it's what like it is circulating so you know like blood moves through your veins and your arteries right it looks like it's moving through the puddle and then like that like out one puncture in the other out one puncture into the puddle and then circulating back into the back into the other

[Speaker 4]
that's weird disturbing do I see like any anything that's that is a part of is that a part of a bigger thing that is doing that the entire

[Speaker 1]
magic the entire trail that has been yeah it if you look further behind you can see the trail that was left behind but yeah it was um it's it's the entire trail doing this at the moment

[Speaker 4]
is he incapacitated you said yes okay um what race is he

[Speaker 1]
pale not dead he's a human

[Speaker 4]
okay hmm I'm gonna fly back up and relay this information quietly

[Speaker 7]
do we want a divination what the fuck is going on here I think that's a good idea

[Speaker 4]
fantastic let's do that

[Speaker 7]
hey god what the fuck

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 4]
you ask a single question

[Speaker 1]
concerning a specific goal event or activity to occur within seven days the referee offers a truthful reply might be a short phrase a cryptic rhyme or an omen the spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion if you cast a spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest there's a cumulative 25% chance for each casting after the first you get a random reading

[Speaker 4]
okay so be precise or he'll just tell us that he's leaving

[Speaker 1]
that's not that bad

[Speaker 6]
yeah I have a bad feeling about that

[Speaker 5]
oh by the way I'm still gonna hold my concentration on your invisibility until I don't need it anymore

[Speaker 4]
you guys just hear a random hey so

[Speaker 1]
alright Pera what question

[Speaker 10]
would you like to ask

[Speaker 7]
what happened to this guy

[Speaker 4]
did you hear me

[Speaker 1]
yep I'm thinking

[Speaker 4]
okay it's hard to be god

[Speaker 1]
open goddamn you okay so some fae are born in blood and others still take it some fae are born in blood others have it taken from them others still can take it but only at the direction of one who might take it but only at the direction of other creatures who need it to live this man was taken by the Sheehybladan at the direction of one who needs blood the Sheehy feed on luck and take blood by accident but when blood is taken from them they are bound in short you've stumbled into the in short you've stumbled into what used to be a fae's lair but is now controlled by a vampire

[Speaker 4]
oh is he hot

[Speaker 10]
rude that was not the time

[Speaker 1]
the gentleman in front of you is attractive sure he's also currently not a vampire

[Speaker 5]
hey here's an easy way to become undead

[Speaker 6]
this is why a significant fraction of the parties that enter Curse of Strahd end up working for them

[Speaker 5]
no okay so we've got that information are we skedaddling are we taking this guy I don't

[Speaker 7]
do checks do we wanna do checks

[Speaker 4]
what would we be checking cause

[Speaker 7]
yeah I know um

[Speaker 4]
if we get rid of this guy the vampire doesn't have a good supply so why don't we just like

[Speaker 5]
slash his throat I don't like the idea but yes but you understand that the vampire then would go after someone else right yeah and also be a little angry at someone who figured out how to get down which is more problems than it worth if you're going to save him then sure but killing him doesn't solve anything

[Speaker 6]
um does it look like he's under mind wait I'm pretty sure this has already been said but does it look like he's under mind altering effects

[Speaker 7]
he has blood coming out of him going back in him

[Speaker 6]
he's probably losing

[Speaker 10]
yeah

[Speaker 6]
just like thinking like vampires we could make a decision here

[Speaker 4]
the information that we have or we can talk to the darklings who may also have information about this yeah okay

[Speaker 6]
I'm just gonna do this I am going so to the what was the name of the I think it was the hireling you were working with right my mind is just not really working

[Speaker 1]
choose a subject send instruction who are you referring to right now the the person your hireling

[Speaker 6]
no like it was someone else's

[Speaker 1]
hireling like yes uh lady violet yeah uh

[Speaker 6]
so well before before I would do that okay I'm just gonna like okay carries all right gonna do sending to lady violet 25 words

[Speaker 1]
uh uh think about okay the other other people while he thinks about it and it's easy to do to count 25 words if you start typing it but um but yeah everybody else what are you doing right now

[Speaker 10]
I

[Speaker 5]
so we are absconding we are leaving this guy here

[Speaker 1]
you guys have 30 seconds to do something

[Speaker 3]
is he alive

[Speaker 4]
he is alive but I don't think we can do anything I mean he should be safe for another 10 minutes okay

[Speaker 3]
why don't we want to save him

[Speaker 4]
um well I don't really know how

[Speaker 3]
can we well

[Speaker 9]
pick him up

[Speaker 3]
is he stuck is he bound or can we lift him and carry

[Speaker 5]
him out I don't know there's a weird blood ritual going on can we

[Speaker 3]
see him yes okay can we see whether he has manacles around

[Speaker 5]
blood

[Speaker 4]
going out and in yeah I think if we take him he might die but you

[Speaker 2]
know at least we tried okay

[Speaker 3]
circulating his blood and if he gets cut off from it then he runs out of blood and

[Speaker 2]
he dies yeah the vampire knows that we're messing with his shit

[Speaker 3]
fuck the vampire save the innocent person

[Speaker 7]
I can make a medicine check go for it let me use my plus 18

[Speaker 1]
yeah he doesn't really have yeah okay

[Speaker 5]
18 plus 18

[Speaker 1]
he's not actually lost enough blood to like have a really big problem right maybe two hearts

[Speaker 7]
we can yoink him we can yoink him

[Speaker 3]
let's yoink him maybe throw a little cure on him uh see if that'll stem the blood

[Speaker 4]
are there like is there a way to get down that doesn't involve wings yes okay well let's go down there

[Speaker 1]
it's looping all the way around and there's like a grand central door grand central chamber that that goes beyond this one

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna fly down

[Speaker 1]
but you already flew down

[Speaker 4]
and then I came back up but I'm gonna fly back down

[Speaker 2]
I'm also gonna keep watch while the stronger people lift the body and move him

[Speaker 4]
very good

[Speaker 6]
that is what I will son

[Speaker 4]
I don't know anything about vampires um about how to kill them or anything so I don't know if this is a really bad idea but oh it's terrible

[Speaker 6]
vampires person trapped is what's it like interesting

[Speaker 10]
but maybe this will weaken him

[Speaker 6]
so might as well be efficient with

[Speaker 1]
how we go about it okay and last question are you guys still stealthing or do you

[Speaker 4]
oh definitely I wasn't planning on it I don't see much of a reason to if the guy is here and he's gonna know that we're here when we cut off his blood supply

[Speaker 10]
yes

[Speaker 4]
so there's not really much of a reason to I mean there probably is but I don't see it so

[Speaker 7]
neither do I I mean I suppose if we wanted a quick out we could teleport

[Speaker 5]
yeah I'm going to cast should I cast a spell magic on this use your teleport

[Speaker 7]
for the weak

[Speaker 5]
oh I can't teleportation circle

[Speaker 1]
not for a let's see here you can do

[Speaker 10]
that will

[Speaker 1]
the month versus week versus whatever

[Speaker 7]
this is the one that I put every month but it lasts a year after I make it and that's the one that's in Asheros in that guy's apartment and then the one for a week is this one

[Speaker 1]
right your week one was used to basically get the people back and then teleport back to the pool yeah so your once per week has been used up

[Speaker 6]
by the way how does Lady Violet respond

[Speaker 1]
since that can be done through sending you're understood waiting outside waiting outside the dumpster the dumpster with a private boat recover the body

[Speaker 2]
let's go

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 2]
we have to go back

[Speaker 7]
yeah just another thing it says that I can teleport to the circle at will

[Speaker 1]
it was just like the free teleport if you're going somewhere else

[Speaker 7]
yeah because if we went to the apartment where we had the circle then that would have been at will right so it wouldn't have used the weekly teleport

[Speaker 1]
no so use the weekly teleport to get to the use the weekly teleport to get to the Ysrigan to bring some of these people back

[Speaker 7]
yes

[Speaker 1]
that was over a week ago wasn't it no this just happened

[Speaker 7]
I was thinking we could teleport out now to the other guy's apartment where I have the circle at will if we wanted a quick out

[Speaker 2]
how many people can you do oh god how much is that they're waiting for the body though yeah they're waiting up so we can just go yeah we'll just carry it we can use the quick out another day

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna ready a spell if I see a pale freak um come out of any place I'm gonna do like a confusion spell

[Speaker 6]
oh I'm gonna do you one better I'll ready an action to cast banishment if I see one come

[Speaker 5]
perfect are we banishing the gnome as we go past again you know I

[Speaker 4]
probably not we're bringing a vampire, not a vampire we're bringing an injured man out so um yeah we could've gone in through anyway it's fine

[Speaker 2]
we could talk our way out of it he's just a little dude I mean we're just gonna do run by we'll just wave at him as we drag the body away yeah okay fine

[Speaker 5]
we can convince him he's hallucinating sure why not

[Speaker 1]
so you guys tell me what's happening or caller tell me what's happening

[Speaker 10]
actually no

[Speaker 1]
I said caller and then people can disagree if there's individual actions

[Speaker 3]
we are exiting with our injured person in tow without doing anything to to disturb or antagonize the goblin proprietor

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 6]
should be noted that lucent will prepare a action to cast banishment if a vampire appears because we decide to disturb it

[Speaker 1]
right which will come in handy in a moment because you see a chained werewolf burst out of one of the side chambers I will have him make a

[Speaker 10]
perfect

[Speaker 1]
okay regardless you guys will be able to get out I'm just going to do a couple rolls in the meantime I'll let you guys take a ten minute break

[Speaker 3]
very well good work everyone

[Speaker 7]
happy with our

[Speaker 3]
progress assuming it sounds like we're going to get out in any case what's our next step

[Speaker 5]
so there's this burst out werewolf yes I think he

[Speaker 7]
said it was on chains so

[Speaker 5]
didn't it say break out of chains or did I misunderstand burst out of a wall is what I heard

[Speaker 3]
suppose we don't have to deal with the werewolf suppose it's not our problem

[Speaker 1]
you guys are getting out

[Speaker 3]
I assume that means we get out of the entire situation yeah after that

[Speaker 5]
we should probably okay after that should we warn that goblin about the werewolf that just broke out

[Speaker 3]
sure we can do that but what are we going to do after after we're done with this goblin secret area we go outside and we're in the town

[Speaker 2]
we're going to go outside we're going to drop the guy we're carrying off with Violet and she's going to take the body away

[Speaker 3]
where's Violet right now

[Speaker 2]
outside by the dumpster waiting for us with a boat

[Speaker 3]
okay cool so we'll drop this guy off with her she'll take him and we'll also at that point we should probably say hey I want an answer an arrow may answer face to face please this is the opportunity to do that I think do you guys agree

[Speaker 2]
sure I don't know if it really yeah we could do it I mean there is the werewolf are we going to assume that that werewolf has nothing to do with anything and didn't break free at that night

[Speaker 5]
we should probably tell Lady Violet about the werewolf yes and maybe she can then tell the I don't know city guards

[Speaker 6]
if maybe if that werewolf attacks us I have calm emotions so we can just keep running

[Speaker 5]
yes again but we should should we alert the city guards that hey by the way there is a werewolf

[Speaker 2]
yeah and maybe a vampire below that's concerning isn't it yeah because if that werewolf is the one that did it so we should

[Speaker 5]
probably tell the guards about the werewolf itself and maybe maybe the vampire and then but yeah so we're dumping it with Lady Violet and hoping that she sends him to hospital or something the guy

[Speaker 3]
do we trust Lady Violet to like not experiment on this guy is she a good person

[Speaker 2]
I would assume so I mean her business isn't collecting people it's working for a dream dancer

[Speaker 5]
so we are putting our trust in Lady Violet to send him to hospital do you think that she will still show up at the party and we rely on that or should we talk to her as she's boating him to wherever

[Speaker 10]
I think we should do it now

[Speaker 2]
or when we do the handoff we can ask her where they're going to take him yeah okay and we can probably ask her if we can see the

[Speaker 7]
one-man answer

[Speaker 2]
yeah make sure she's taking them somewhere to get healed ask about the one-er the

[Speaker 3]
one-er answer

[Speaker 2]
this is why I was confused because Otter does that

[Speaker 3]
we are readers

[Speaker 5]
the dream answer the dream diviner you can just say dream diviner because that's the same it's the same thing

[Speaker 3]
okay so I've got a question which is who do we tell about the werewolves and the vampire and the she-he blah-do-ba-do she-he-blah-don

[Speaker 4]
I don't know

[Speaker 3]
well I'm my concern is that the guards tried to cover stuff up or the guy said that the guards tried to cover stuff up even though he's not a super reliable witness because he had brain stuff we could tell

[Speaker 7]
the shackles proprietor I had her name I even told Nessie and now Moira we could tell her because that affects her it's like right outside her business

[Speaker 2]
so we tell the goblins

[Speaker 5]
we tell Moira we tell Violet I will mention we did commit a minor crime of breaking an entering but it's probably going to be overlooked hopefully it's overlooked by the werewolves yeah we can be like you know

[Speaker 6]
we've uncovered a potential future plot

[Speaker 3]
yeah but I kind of think the proprietor of the shackles are they an adventurer I don't know tell like a small business owner oh yeah there's a vampire evil pharaoh incursion happening across the street like are they going to be the ones to crack down on it?

[Speaker 4]
I don't know it's in her basement right?

[Speaker 3]
no it's in the basement of the people

[Speaker 4]
across

[Speaker 3]
it was in the basement of the goblin mushroom place

[Speaker 7]
you hire them to kill the rats in your basement

[Speaker 2]
she can hire us to get rid of them and then we like interrogate the werewolf and point at it be like evidence

[Speaker 3]
yeah I guess what I'm thinking is more like this could be like a bigger problem for the city and we might want to bypass the city guard and like talk to in the city and not just like the random neighbor of this place

[Speaker 7]
do we know who's higher than the guards?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know the political structure of the city my first time here the guards I guess like the mayor or something? is there a mayor? or is this like the realm of a duke or a baron I don't know what the political structure is it a city state?

does it rule itself? I don't know

[Speaker 1]
it's like a loose council and a mayor who directs like military actions by and large the people are kind of free to govern themselves here

[Speaker 3]
so probably talk to the council then or the mayor

[Speaker 1]
the council does the military stuff but that's not really in-house intervention it's like the city watch and there are nobles who will discuss new laws and stuff like that it's like a common law England kind of thing people make specific rulings based on did you do something that somebody else would kill you over? right? or otherwise try to retaliate against you for doing that

[Speaker 3]
my thought is the people who can control what an army does might care that there's a ferry incursion happening in their town where they live and sleep that's the hope the hope is that they might take a battalion or they might have access oh this is an act of war in addition to someone who died here in addition to there's a crime to solve this could be an act of war

[Speaker 7]
I don't know if there's necessarily a ferry incursion because it sounded like there was an old ferry incursion and now it's a vampire

[Speaker 1]
what you were told exactly is that there are ferries in here and they were named

[Speaker 3]
shehebladon

[Speaker 1]
which is spelled because it's Irish

[Speaker 3]
s-l-d-h-e

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to pronounce it

[Speaker 6]
yeah like

[Speaker 3]
b-l-o-b-o-g-h-n or something

[Speaker 1]
I know we

[Speaker 7]
at least I thought we encountered them the luck vampires

[Speaker 1]
yes you have

[Speaker 7]
when we did the time thing yeah

[Speaker 5]
one of them was being a bitch

[Speaker 7]
and

[Speaker 5]
I don't remember oh yes the time vampires ok

[Speaker 7]
yeah they're actually luck vampires and not time vampires

[Speaker 2]
they wanted to steal the luck of the child

[Speaker 3]
yeah so that said I'm not gonna like do anything I think if you guys are cool talking to the shackles person and seeing where it goes from there that's fine I just wanted to contribute my two cents just as like you know Lirian's view that's it it sounded like the consensus was hand over guy to lady violet um ask lady violet about the oneiromancer and then talk to shackles proprietor about the luck vampires and the she-he-ble-don are those is everyone on board with like those are all the things we want to do

[Speaker 5]
yes and ask lady violet where she's taking the man

[Speaker 3]
alright yeah make sure she's not gonna chop him up or at least make her lie about it to our faces

[Speaker 5]
so ask lady violet then go to the shackles lady ask her about the luck vampire and blood fairies and then maybe what were we going to do with the werewolf information talk to Moira also Moira

[Speaker 3]
oh that's the shackles proprietor yeah

[Speaker 5]
so tell the shackles proprietor about the fae, the vampire and the werewolf

[Speaker 3]
that whole situation if we're going to tell someone about any part of that we should probably tell them about all of it that is like one chunk of stuff that is happening

[Speaker 10]
ok

[Speaker 1]
ok so this pursuit goes lucent you you toss a banishment out and it does not work alright this creature is going to attempt to bite you

[Speaker 4]
the my confusion spell

[Speaker 1]
right we're also casting

[Speaker 4]
ok let me grab that

[Speaker 1]
you have a safety city of 22 or higher

[Speaker 4]
um what would I see that is this before or after I cast um

[Speaker 3]
you can see your spells tab spells tab at the top

[Speaker 4]
spells tab at the top uh no

[Speaker 1]
oh it might be because of the new sheen I don't think it's really nice

[Speaker 7]
yeah mine is a DC of 20

[Speaker 4]
mine is 17

[Speaker 1]
does a 17 hit lucent of course it does oh ok alright lucent make me a constitution saving throw

[Speaker 6]
alright I'm going to re-roll that using a sorcery point

[Speaker 7]
um actually that's a constitution para is definitely within that so I will spend some uh remedies to um just pip that up

[Speaker 1]
roll me a roll me a d6 if it's a 3 or higher you will be within 10 feet to affect it if you don't have like a battle map assorted right now and some people are running yeah you're good

[Speaker 7]
ok

[Speaker 1]
and how many would you like to boost this by

[Speaker 7]
uh let's see he needs to make a 12 and he's got 10 so I guess I'll just do 2 because then even if I roll minimum he's got it right yep

[Speaker 8]
there just in case thank you

[Speaker 6]
so uh how much is the damage oh that's right

[Speaker 1]
alright yeah uh that was pretty much my only concern there and then how are you guys

[Speaker 5]
getting out of here running

[Speaker 3]
uh up the stairs

[Speaker 5]
as we go by at the goblin

[Speaker 10]
goblin we just run by him

[Speaker 1]
hold on everybody stop caller what are you guys doing

[Speaker 3]
we are going back through the basement area up through the stairs out through the hatch that we originally entered in calling out a warning to the goblin if we see him

[Speaker 1]
so you guys are getting out by running and is somebody carrying who's carrying the

[Speaker 3]
who has the highest strength stat lyrian has a 7

[Speaker 1]
that's almost certainly going to be corpus

[Speaker 3]
corpus what's your strength score

[Speaker 1]
14

[Speaker 3]
does anyone have higher than a 14

[Speaker 1]
nope

[Speaker 3]
no okay yep corpus you're carrying the victim

[Speaker 1]
and he's got a pretty high speed

[Speaker 3]
is that an animal or a baby I couldn't tell

[Speaker 6]
okay since uh probably not gonna be happening okay um I could cast telekinesis and just carry him out using that

[Speaker 1]
I think we already figured out how he's this is not like the discussion time if you're going to cast you could do something that's different from what the caller said or in addition to what the caller said it's not the time for discussion you say I'm doing this thing or it's not happening

[Speaker 10]
I'll do it

[Speaker 1]
okay use telekinesis to do that

[Speaker 3]
so that's concentration 10 minutes

[Speaker 6]
we got more than enough time

[Speaker 3]
yeah but it means we do want to protect you from being hit and that kind of stuff

[Speaker 6]
yeah so I'll just stay in the middle

[Speaker 3]
yeah I like it I like it elegant solution

[Speaker 6]
besides I have constitution saving throws yeah proficiency so

[Speaker 10]
yeah

[Speaker 3]
that'll be good um maybe have a little bit of discussion time here uh do we know exactly what we want from the Anaramancer I think we talked about this earlier just want to double check if anyone's

[Speaker 7]
Hera wants information

[Speaker 3]
information and this is about protection from the Shivara like defensive and offensive information whatever they got is that the kind of idea

[Speaker 2]
yep and Mimosa needs information about assassins

[Speaker 3]
like people coming after you or you sending it after someone else

[Speaker 2]
no they have a dagger that Mimosa wants so she needs to get it

[Speaker 3]
okay information where's this dagger what's it's protected you're getting information you need in order to be able to steal it good okay

[Speaker 1]
what's Lucent's AC 13 13 okay that was damage

[Speaker 3]
holy shit 28 that would hit me

[Speaker 1]
7 and then 11 go ahead and make me con saves for maintaining concentration and then con saves for lycanthropy alright so that'd be 4 yes but do the

[Speaker 6]
two con saves for concentration first there you go alright the concentration is maintained gonna re-roll that with sorcery point alright much better and then one last one yep crushed it

[Speaker 5]
good job

[Speaker 10]
okay

[Speaker 1]
and then you guys make it out okay

[Speaker 3]
so next on our agenda was meeting up with Violet by the dumpster handing off the victim and trying to ensure that she'll be taking good care of him and acting in their interest

[Speaker 2]
yeah and telling her there's a werewolf and a vampire

[Speaker 3]
down there yeah we'll download her about the shehebladon as well

[Speaker 2]
the werewolf ends up breaking

[Speaker 1]
off pursuit as you guys leave the chamber

[Speaker 5]
breaking off pursuit what do you

[Speaker 3]
he's not chasing us anymore

[Speaker 5]
okay thank you for now

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna go use the rest room

[Speaker 6]
yeah I'm getting more into the habit of just if I have a resource just use it

[Speaker 1]
good as you guys debated for like an hour on whether or not to use like of your 60 divination spells divination school spells well we got this information this information you guys did use it eventually which worked perfectly and you chose a good subject to do it okay so you guys stop by lady Lenore she's a little bit shocked to see this scene here the gentleman that you guys are carrying around is a little bit is certainly weirded out and just like completely fucking out of his mind right now now the goblin was not there when you guys got back

[Speaker 2]
okay gonna scrawl a note and like leave it somewhere as they're running by it's not her best penmanship

[Speaker 1]
oh wait there's a werewolf in your classroom farm

[Speaker 3]
that is currently attacking me as I write this

[Speaker 2]
yeah sorry for carrying you she can run fast didn't exactly say no apologies for the ink stains not only do you have darklings but you have a vampire and a werewolf and some fae and some fae have a good day also your mushrooms have blood on it

[Speaker 3]
do you think this is a discussion point do you think the goblins know about this got to right

[Speaker 9]
I mean

[Speaker 6]
if it's vampires they could be charmed

[Speaker 1]
I sincerely doubt it looking at the state of this gentleman I don't think a goblin farmer is really involved in this I wouldn't expect a goblin farmer to be involved in this

[Speaker 2]
rather safe than sorry

[Speaker 1]
feel free to make any assumptions that you wish my primary concern

[Speaker 10]
be right back

[Speaker 8]
okay

[Speaker 1]
anyways so what were we where were we what were we talking about we

[Speaker 3]
having just escaped the escape hatch the basement of the goblin farmer we move to the dumpster area behind the shackles where lady violet has been waiting for us and we hand over the victim and inform her about the goings on in the basement, the werewolves the vampire, the she-he-bo-don and we inquire as to whether she'll be able to to take care of the victim and get them the treatment they need

[Speaker 1]
absolutely we'll be going to come into my boat here really I'm just going to get him to a hospital

[Speaker 8]
all right yeah

[Speaker 2]
get into the boat

[Speaker 1]
you can also appear to be cursed not afflicted with vampirism which is what I would have expected and what was the term you used she-he-blo-don

[Speaker 3]
she-he-blo-don

[Speaker 1]
yes all right very well

[Speaker 6]
um luca is just like gonna look at the man yeah and then look at lady violet think it's safe to uh heal him a bit I could do something that could at least patch him up

[Speaker 1]
a little bit right now uh sure yes if you wish to give him some stabilizing medicine or something of that variety

[Speaker 6]
there we go he'll get back 9 hp

[Speaker 1]
see a little bit of color return to his face and yes there's a treatment center there's actually a temple quite close by so this won't take much time at all in the meantime may I ask what you were doing down there

[Speaker 3]
uh we had gotten an indication from a uh from a witness um that there had been uh tracks leading into the uh the basement entrance over there um animal tracks and since we had suspected a uh a lycanthrope of some kind or some kind of were-being um uh we thought it would uh it was worth investigating I see

[Speaker 8]
I see clearly

[Speaker 6]
and yes there was a werewolf down there yeah

[Speaker 3]
and the witness who gave us the lead we also suspect of being a werewolf and they've been taken away by the city guard in silver handcuffs

[Speaker 1]
yes I heard some tell about it

[Speaker 3]
now team I think we might want to make a persuade roll here um to get a face-to-face with the unaramancer

[Speaker 2]
I guess I can do that

[Speaker 3]
okay I like that

[Speaker 2]
or or

[Speaker 5]
or the bard they have high persuasion

[Speaker 8]
whichever

[Speaker 6]
my character is pretty damn good at persuading people

[Speaker 3]
let's talk numbers does anyone have a plus eight or higher

[Speaker 2]
I have a plus nine and I cannot roll under a ten so I will get a minimum of nineteen okay

[Speaker 3]
persuasion we're talking we're hoping to persuade an NPC

[Speaker 6]
yep so that means your bare minimum is like what nineteen

[Speaker 3]
exactly

[Speaker 2]
what is Karis'

[Speaker 4]
uh nine

[Speaker 2]
okay

[Speaker 10]
oh hi buddy

[Speaker 1]
oh the people who suck down money without actually producing anything okay any guys who would have gotten there all right yeah so I'm happy to I guess leave it there if anybody is um I might be back on after my after my meeting

[Speaker 3]
there's one additional thing

[Speaker 1]
like a party or something like that yes sorry go ahead

[Speaker 3]
there's one additional thing we might be able to resolve just here at the end which is a persuasion attempt on Lady Violet before she leaves on the boat or maybe we get on the boat with her um to let us have a face to face with the Anaramancer instead of only meeting Lady Violet

[Speaker 1]
yes I think that that can be arranged I will see if she wishes she's very particular about how she wants to do this long story short she will send a sending back to Lady Violet there will be some discussion back and forth between the two of them Lady Seen will agree to show up at some point during the party um for a for a brief face to face meeting but you will still be going through the initial filter of Lady Violet

[Speaker 3]
okay

[Speaker 2]
could we tell you a bit about what we'd like to discuss with her

[Speaker 3]
we can do that async though right if you need to go

[Speaker 1]
right well I need to go in about two minutes I know I I'm pretty sure what you guys want to discuss so far but if you have any additional stuff yeah go ahead and tell me somebody should note this down as well like what are you planning to discuss with her

[Speaker 2]
um Hera do you want to say like Shiveroth oh yeah

[Speaker 1]
okay then he knows you guys are talking about the Shivergroth you're trying to find the assassin you were talking about earlier and then I didn't know if there was anything extra that you

[Speaker 7]
yeah I don't know if anyone else had any plans or if they were just going with ours

[Speaker 3]
um I I might but it would I'd kind of need to know like what her what her skill set like what what are the things that she's more likely to know about than someone else because she has dream magic stuff

[Speaker 1]
yeah so think of think of divination that or think of an Iromancer as just being like a sub school of divination mixed with psionics

[Speaker 3]
uh

[Speaker 1]
or the equivalent of divination for psionics it's a little bit of column A but a little bit of column B

[Speaker 3]
okay in that case Lirian

[Speaker 1]
basically AD&D Sage

[Speaker 3]
yeah uh very good Lirian will be interested in knowing if there are any um uh like getting any leads on Bladesinger uh legendary items or artifacts like powerful Bladesinger items

[Speaker 10]
okay yes

[Speaker 6]
well I mean if we're going to be like asking about magic items uh Lucin will probably like ask like if she knows anything for uh yeah like anything that could be of use to a sorcerer like him

[Speaker 1]
anything that can be of use to a sorcerer yeah the Sage is going to mostly ignore that kind of question but come up with something specific and be like um the way that used to work in AD&D is if you wanted a specific magic item as opposed to like purchasing it you would your excuse for um paying a Sage to like tell you the location or tell you of the location give you some hints was was basically the Dungeon Master's excuse to give you that item and to take away your money yeah it's like purchasing it but there's one extra step where you still have to adventure you just get to adventure in the place that has the item the specific item that you want

[Speaker 6]
alright uh a Far Realm Shard okay

[Speaker 1]
interesting very interesting choice and thematically appropriate yeah I think that will weave in nicely here you guys are free to continue talking I'm going to go use the restroom and get ready for my meeting here because I'm probably going to be talking with my thoughts for about 10 minutes but I'll still be listening so okay

[Speaker 3]
uh so we've heard from uh I think Nessie about the Shivagroth and Rez about Sorcerer or was that Mech

[Speaker 6]
oh I asked about Far Realm Shard

[Speaker 3]
Far Realm Shard for Mech Bladesinger item for me who's asking about the Assassin was that Heart

[Speaker 7]
that was Parra okay um

[Speaker 2]
yeah the Shivagroth is Parra's thing

[Speaker 3]
okay

[Speaker 2]
I mean it involves Bermosa but it's Parra's thing

[Speaker 3]
um does anyone else have any requests I don't know how many we're going to be allowed to get but uh I've written what we've done so far

[Speaker 5]
suppose I can ask for if this let's see suppose I can ask after Staffs of the Magi or if she knows how to

[Speaker 3]
you know is that the more powerful or the less powerful one that's the

[Speaker 5]
more powerful one

[Speaker 3]
the legendary one great love it

[Speaker 6]
but yeah if I combine so with Far Realm Shard I could be dealing out 3d6 psychic damage to three different targets and effectively get a frightening condition on two of them and then get the actual frightening condition on another all I have to do is just cast one twin dissonant whispers that's uh that's just two sorcery points because that's how sorcery works

[Speaker 5]
I wonder if there are any abandoned towers one can just make their house

[Speaker 4]
they're abandoned once the um wizard dies could be arranged

[Speaker 5]
could be arranged for someone to

[Speaker 4]
isn't that one like attacked by a blue dragon yeah we got out of there I think some people stayed behind and they won the battle but I went and chanced and shit

[Speaker 6]
yeah so you probably have to go for a different tower and hey I'm like hey Lucerne and Kira could be perfectly willing to taxi people around using the pyramid teleportation

[Speaker 10]
if they want to go

[Speaker 4]
find does anyone know how to access past session reports because it only goes up to February 11

[Speaker 7]
um there's a second one if you go down so like there's the the ones in the Samheed quests and discussions little sectiony thing and then if you go down um

[Speaker 4]
where did he put that I think I could just add you to where it is because I got the one that's current but yeah it only goes back to the 11th of February well you see that's yeah that's the one I'm at but I want to see past it because it

[Speaker 5]
oh you want the ones that are previous the ones past that there was an old folder

[Speaker 7]
but oh oh hang on okay so do you see the Samheed boogaloo yes in the old folder it's it's a thread in that one

[Speaker 4]
oh boy okay ah

[Speaker 5]
I can grab the link for it if you can't get it

[Speaker 4]
I got it thank you okay I'm also having trouble with plutonium because they don't have the gloves but it says in the wiki that gloves of thievery are sourced from dungeon master's guide really it's not showing up in plutonium in foundry yeah not in plutonium or the item shop

[Speaker 7]
I can't get it I see gloves of thievery do you do I do I just not have check your filter and make sure everything is sourced on make sure nothing is like clicked on it

[Speaker 4]
so it's got 5e tools but that's the only thing that's yeah

[Speaker 7]
5e tools is the only one you need

[Speaker 4]
okay and that's in items

[Speaker 7]
yes in items open importer

[Speaker 4]
open importer

[Speaker 7]
at the very top there's another filter click on that and make sure everything is selected on their sources there's a button next to sources on the right hand side that says all and make sure you're in sources and not the very top because there's a show all hide all show all no don't do show all underneath you should see like source and then there's a bunch of names there do you see that

[Speaker 4]
um

[Speaker 7]
yes and then like over on the right hand side you'll see all clear none default

[Speaker 4]
hold on can we start over real quick can you share your screen

[Speaker 7]
yes that might make it easier for me to figure out where you're going

[Speaker 4]
so I'm here I'm at

[Speaker 7]
okay open importer now here there's a filter see you've got some red things there um so click on those red things so that you don't have them because one of those might be blocking your ability to see what you're looking for um no interesting okay click filter again um ah yeah okay it wasn't clicked on um so do you see okay you found it it's fine

[Speaker 4]
thank you I just didn't want to mess anything up

[Speaker 7]
yeah no you're good but under the filter there's an option to select all so you don't have to manually select every single book um thank you mystery has been solved

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to shut down my recording here but well done people

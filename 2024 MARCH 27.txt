[Speaker 7]
Oh, yes!

[Speaker 5]
The fucking immediate smile on James' face.

[Speaker 1]
It means I get to play Christopher Pineas.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it means he gets to be a dick to me the rest of the night. Some way.

[Speaker 6]
I guess I'll probably be a survivalist.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, and what class did you say you were?

[Speaker 6]
Druid.

[Speaker 4]
Druid, and you said survivalist. So you get Verdant Resilience. Okay.

Gain temporary hit points equal to a check you made during the journey. These temporary hit points last until removed.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Ooh! Okay, I like that.

[Speaker 6]
It's if I, you know, got a free use of my, uh, the sword druid thing.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, a tracker! You can sub- for me, for Bard, you can substitute the typical check with a performance check. On a success, the path to your target manifests as colored notes that you can follow to the target's precise destination.

That's cool. That's so cool.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, here's what I get if I do Vanguard and I'm Ranger. Upon successfully identifying a threat hazard, you always act first, ignoring initiative for the first round if the situation involves combat. Additionally, two creatures of your choice can share your initiative.

Hm. So, nothing that can, like, improve, like, controls that we make while traveling now. Okay, everybody.

Uh, can I just roll?

[Speaker 3]
Um, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I don't want people to yell at me when I get something wrong. Okay. I...

[Speaker 3]
We're not gonna yell.

[Speaker 2]
I... Yeah, just normal. There's no reason for disadvantage.

God, that... Uh, what did I even roll? Eight.

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Sixteen. I don't think that's a downright failure. Unless if I were like, what are we going through?

Um... James will tell us.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. We start here, but I think we were, like, towards the mountains when we encountered the dragon.

[Speaker 6]
Given that we're hunting a dragon, I'm gonna take Earth... I'm gonna prepare Earthbind for this.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I have any, like, long-term things.

[Speaker 4]
Use dragon rend. Wish that was a spell in D&D.

[Speaker 8]
Uh, yes.

[Speaker 4]
I'm sure we can find something.

[Speaker 7]
Gotta find the local Parthenax XP. Uh, I guess? How would I ward this?

[Speaker 2]
Do dragons tend to, uh, use both their hands? Do they multiattack? I didn't want to, like, say it in, like, a super metagame-y way, but...

[Speaker 7]
Oh, and by the way, you're a ranger, and this gives you exploration expertise. Uh... What?

Uh...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I read the thing below. I read, like, ranger hunter, but there's probably a thing for ranger itself, isn't there? Let me check that.

[Speaker 7]
Exploration... Ranger... Uh...

You can basically take on multiple roles. If you'd like.

[Speaker 3]
What role would a camper be?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, this is here. Uh, yeah, I'll copy and paste this and add it too, I think. Uh, beginning at third level, you practice in exploration of Wild and Greatest Challenge.

You can take one additional exploration role for every fabled terrain you have. Alternatively, you can take one of the additional roles at 6th level and, again, 10th and 14th level.

[Speaker 7]
I'm... I'm a... So I didn't get complaints about it, but I...

[Speaker 2]
I tend to not... The ranger I like is the alternative ranger, like the one that has, instead of fabled terrain, has, uh... If I have to change that, I will.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, primal... No, not primal. Uh...

Yeah, I think it's primal awareness. I don't have fabled terrain as this ranger. Let me check.

Uh...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wait. I should have that.

[Speaker 6]
But yeah, the whole reason why I asked about the hydro thing was entirely because I had a funny feeling that would give me just enough XP to level up, and I did.

[Speaker 7]
I'll be back. Hmm. Oh yeah, I get to summon Draconic Spirit.

[Speaker 6]
Dragon on dragon violence.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, no, I do have fabled terrain. It's just not labeled as fabled terrain. Okay, uh...

[Speaker 7]
Well...

[Speaker 2]
So... Actually, no. I have daft explore, because you can either have one or the other.

Would you allow me to... I don't know if the DM's here. Would you allow me to have both?

[Speaker 6]
Doesn't it mention that you can only... It replaces it?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it only replaces it, so...

[Speaker 7]
Alright, how did everyone's rolls go? I got pretty bad. Oh, neat!

You're a ranger.

[Speaker 2]
What kind of natural terrain did you go with? Or fabled terrain? That's kind of what we're talking about.

So, you know how you can, like, replace it with daft explore? Am I allowed to do that in this campaign, or no?

[Speaker 7]
You can. Like, what's daft explore? It's the optional feature for rangers that they got in Tasha's...

Alright, nevermind. If you'd like to go ahead, and if you'd like to change it, that's totally fine. But, like I said, alright, so we got a 16.

That's not bad at all. And what was everybody doing here?

[Speaker 1]
Rowan, you got a survival check. I assume you're the survivalist.

[Speaker 6]
No, that was for the downtime. No, instead I have to make as if I was doing the harvesting for the... So I'm about to just do it now.

[Speaker 1]
About to do the harvesting.

[Speaker 6]
And that's a crit!

[Speaker 7]
That's 28. And I'm the camper? Oh, not one.

Total 12. Let's see here. Okay, so, Rowan, what was your skill check for?

[Speaker 1]
Survivalist. Survivalist, okay. Cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 4]
I also did survive. No, wait, hold on. I did tracker, which I can substitute the typical check with a performance check.

On success, the path that leads to the target manifests as colored notes that you can follow. To the target's precise destination.

[Speaker 6]
Juicy. And because of the special part about Druid, for a survivalist, I get 28 temp HP.

[Speaker 7]
That lasts until removed. Okay, so the DC for this area is... Well, we're going to find out here, because first I'm going to roll for some weather.

[Speaker 4]
Speaking of weather, let me know if you guys can hear the thunder, and I'll just keep myself muted most of the time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you had a storm too?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, it's beautiful. I love storms.

[Speaker 3]
I had one earlier today. Thunder and lightning and hail.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, thunder sounds nice.

[Speaker 7]
A lot of rain here as well lately. To spring. It's just kind of really windy outside.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm going to stick with Death Explorer, because although that means I can't really fully use the...

[Speaker 1]
...execution system, you're getting a benefit with another skill check.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. But because of Death Explorer, I get canny, and that's actually what's giving me expertise and perception.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm. That's totally fine. Okay.

Okay, so what do we have for weather? No general adjustment there. I was wondering where the music was.

[Speaker 1]
Huh. Slow to load. I thought you were asking the music.

Okay, so Charis, you? What was your check total? 22.

22, yeah. Okay, cool. So, let's see here.

Charis succeeded. Randall just barely succeeded. We need a check from Monk, I believe.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was going to do Camper, because it let everybody reroll saving fails, but I don't know what I'm going to do now.

[Speaker 1]
You can do Camper.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
This doesn't count as a success. The benefits accrue to everybody. The success is if you stack up on the same roll, but you can only clear a day's worth of encounters from a roll once.

But the rest of the benefits, you can keep stacking up.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it's an athletics roll?

[Speaker 1]
That seems fitting. Or acrobatics.

[Speaker 3]
We're going to do acrobatics.

[Speaker 1]
I think what's-his-face used athletics specifically because he's a barbarian.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I used my muscles for it or something.

[Speaker 1]
Or successes for a... How about a three-day journey? Actually, I'm just going to roll.

Actually, I'm just going to have it. Really? Yeah, really, it's going to be like...

If you guys did Fast March, you might be able to reach it in a single day. Never really played around with these. Yeah.

Eight hours of fast-paced travel, typically 32 miles, without needing a long rest before risking exhaustion. Okay, so really it's 32 miles. It's just the regular travel speed.

That was something that somebody did incorrectly. Somebody's bad homebrew.

[Speaker 4]
Homebrew. So much of it.

[Speaker 1]
Normal pace is 24 miles. You guys could do a fast pace and basically get there- Or you could do a fast pace and get there in a day.

[Speaker 5]
Fast pace.

[Speaker 4]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You guys do fast pace. You guys need to make me reach our past eight hours. So I just need you guys to actually give me a constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
And the DC will be, I believe, 13.

[Speaker 5]
I'm using one viable dice.

[Speaker 2]
My character has ridiculously high constitution. Although I don't have proficiency with the saves.

[Speaker 6]
I will use- Okay.

[Speaker 5]
16, I pass.

[Speaker 6]
I need to switch back to the proper sheet.

[Speaker 4]
I like Heart Roll. I like this sheet. I don't want to change it.

I just don't know how to do a saving throw on it.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so at the top, under your ability scores, saving throws.

[Speaker 1]
It's red leather.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'm going to blame my ADHD on that one.

[Speaker 1]
It's just they're terrible UXs.

[Speaker 3]
It's a whole new- It's all new.

[Speaker 5]
I like how it looks, personally.

[Speaker 3]
I also like how it looks.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's very pretty.

[Speaker 3]
I just can't use it. It's just so different. I get lost with everything.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
If I'm about to get sneaked up by goblins or goblins of locks, I have a passive perception of 18.

[Speaker 1]
Not during Fast March, you have a passive perception of 13 instead. Passive perception is called for during certain long stretches of activity. Sorry, go ahead.

Let's see here.

[Speaker 6]
My end result for a constitution saving throw was 13 because I used 2d8 of my remedy dice.

[Speaker 1]
Which just succeeds. Monk needs some assistance.

[Speaker 3]
Karis needs some assistance. What does minstrel dice do?

[Speaker 4]
I don't think minstrel dice can help with- No, I'm positive it'll work.

[Speaker 5]
I think I can help you all with this. See, I have herbal dice, and they allow me to increase or decrease the result of a constitution saving throw. I think I'm going to decrease yours because I'm feeling like it's not going to increase.

I'm going to commit 1 for Saris.

[Speaker 3]
If you decrease Monk, it's going to be all hell and I'm going to roll with it.

[Speaker 5]
I'll give 1 for Monk. I'm going to commit 1 on both Monk and Saris. So, for Saris, you get 3.

So you still fail. And Monk, you also get 3, so you also fail.

[Speaker 3]
I don't- Oh, it's 13, isn't it? Damn it.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I'm going to dedicate 2 of my dice. 1 for Monk and 1 for Saris as well.

[Speaker 3]
I just need 1. That can go to Saris.

[Speaker 6]
Saris, yeah, you get that.

[Speaker 3]
I only need to succeed by 1. What did you- Get it! It doesn't matter what we did.

[Speaker 1]
Does that succeed? It's a 13. It's a DC, so, ooh.

[Speaker 3]
No, I got 3 from Rez and then 1. So that's 4, so I pass. I got 13.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, alright, cool, cool.

[Speaker 3]
I met it.

[Speaker 5]
I like how I just am rolling really low at the start.

[Speaker 4]
Get all the bad ones out of the way so that we can- You're throwing your luck to the future.

[Speaker 5]
Exactly, I'm going to nat 20 item against this dragon.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so. Let's see here. First day passes.

Let's see here, because you guys are just getting there in one day. Saris, you notice these little blue musical notes primarily scattered around these different trail markers and cairns that have been left behind. And before long, you actually start coming across a- As you get closer and closer, these notes get a little bit more complex, so it's not just a single F note, it's like an F chord, and then it transitions to three F chords, and there's a little bit of lightning.

In your visualization, this synesthesia effect in you, you start seeing little bits of lightning flitting between the different notes. Let's see here. And this progresses further and further as you get closer and closer and closer, and ends with- You guys come across a rather large storm at the edge of this section of the world below.

For those of you who have not seen it before, so Dallas, there are holes that lead into the Underdark, the world below as it's known in this part of the world, that have sunken further in. There are places between- There's basically platforms between these holes, spires. They're mountains, effectively, but the peaks of them reach ground level with the rest of the surface world.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Are we just passing by these?

[Speaker 1]
Or are we going to- You're going inside. Lovely. There's a constant thunderstorm inside of this.

This is where it leads.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, do you feel the power? Unfortunately.

[Speaker 1]
It is now nightfall. It's about 9pm, which is right as the sun sets during this part of the world, and it's a blue light as the glacier has progressed somewhat between the twin peaks at the top of this valley. At this point, you guys are pretty far away, so it's just this pale blue light that kind of gently eases you into the evening here.

What does the party want to do?

[Speaker 6]
Well, I would have cast Pass Without Trace if you want- Well, if you're going to go stealthy, I'll have Pass Without Trace.

[Speaker 4]
Good idea.

[Speaker 5]
Good idea.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'll- Oh, no, that's the game. I'll stop. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and who else rolled- Let's see here. We had Tracker. We had Survivalist.

Did we have- Did we have Vanguard?

[Speaker 2]
Wasn't that me?

[Speaker 1]
If that was you, then yes.

[Speaker 2]
Vanguard is Perception Check, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you rolled Perception for it. Or you chose Perception based on the circumstance.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I didn't roll that good.

[Speaker 1]
No, you succeeded. What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't specify good or bad creatures, so if I roll bad initiative, I can make our enemies have bad initiative as well. Or am I reading too far into that?

[Speaker 1]
Can share your initiative. So my impression is that they have to be willing, but it doesn't say willing, so I don't know. Maybe we'll just do it as written first and see what happens.

[Speaker 4]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it might be- Yeah, I can come up with an explanation for that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Now, this is pretty impassable terrain. It's just a cloud that you guys are aware goes into a- into a pit of not quite hell. Hell but dark.

[Speaker 4]
So it's going to be a struggle to get through?

[Speaker 1]
It's a matter of you guys telling me how you would like to get through, or how you intend to get through.

[Speaker 4]
Well, we're sneaking, however. Yeah, but sneaking where? Okay, hold on.

I have a harp that can change the weather. So I will just clear that right up, or at least try. Do you guys hear that fucking thunder?

[Speaker 1]
I just did, actually.

[Speaker 4]
That was awesome. It's immersive.

[Speaker 5]
We're immersed.

[Speaker 4]
Definitely feel immersed. I have a lute.

[Speaker 6]
Be like a Jaeger, punch the storm.

[Speaker 1]
James, put on the thunder ASMR. Not quite, not quite. Excellent. Yeah, go ahead and roll me a check with your Spellcasting Ability Modifier.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Spellcasting Ability Modifier.

[Speaker 1]
Where the heck is a...

[Speaker 4]
If I just click the Use Instrument of the Bards, does it work that way? Or do I have to manually do that?

[Speaker 1]
I think so. Go ahead and try it.

[Speaker 4]
I would like to believe that my Spellcasting Ability Modifier is better than that.

[Speaker 1]
It's higher than that. I can confirm that. I'm just looking for the thing that says the weather.

I'm looking for Control Weather at the moment. Why is it using Intelligence for it? Tool Proficiency.

Well, I think you have... Don't you have two Instruments of the Bard?

[Speaker 4]
I do.

[Speaker 1]
Did you pick the one that doesn't have Control Weather on it?

[Speaker 4]
I did, probably. Okay, well, we'll do that one. What the hell is my...

Okay, I'm rolling it with Intelligence, but I need to do Charisma, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct, because right now it's just testing Control Proficiency. 19? 19?

Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 1]
You briefly clear it.

[Speaker 4]
And then it comes back. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
This is a magical thing that...

[Speaker 4]
However... Do I see anything within... Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, okay. So, first things first. Most notable is the fact that it changes...

These notes that you've been keeping track of change positions. Oh, dear. Whereas beforehand, they were just kind of arrayed around this...

Literally just arrayed around this massive hole in the ground, they have instead come to reveal a path slightly further downwards to your right. This kind of... This sub-hex.

[Speaker 4]
To the right? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so what I should do... Do I have, like, a sub-hex template? I feel like I do.

[Speaker 8]
I feel like I do. Cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yeah, so you guys see a path going further downwards. It's, at this point, about 930-ish. What do you guys want to do?

[Speaker 5]
Would it be possible to attempt to climb down? Maybe with an athletics check?

[Speaker 1]
It's a path. You could just walk down. Yeah, and then Charis, of course, has the option of literally just lying.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Down we go.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, I'll go down.

[Speaker 3]
Nope. Down, down, down.

[Speaker 1]
Deeper into hell we go.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, is... He pretends he's walking downstairs. Does everybody have...

Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Does everybody have...

[Speaker 3]
I'm done. Oh, no. That's silly.

[Speaker 2]
I don't, but I thought ahead and got goggles of... Well, I kind of did. I got goggles of night.

Ah, as you shortly mentioned, Adam.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, last season.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I always played characters that had dark vision, so the one time I didn't play a character with dark vision, I, like... I felt so tiny and pathetic, so now I'm like, I need dark vision.

No matter what character...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, heads up. My character doesn't have dark vision.

[Speaker 3]
Same.

[Speaker 2]
Dwight, do we have...

[Speaker 1]
Those of you who don't have dark vision, it is dark. Also, you are inside of a cloud, so those of you with dark vision, you cannot see more than 30 feet ahead of you.

[Speaker 4]
Well, at least you can see 30 feet ahead. My poor bard is just stumbling here. Well, not stumbling.

She's not using her feet.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like I really should have prepared dark vision to help out here.

[Speaker 3]
Monk is now, like, crawling and skittering on the floor.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, this is weird. I... You hear a few soft string notes as you, uh...

[Speaker 1]
as Christopher Pineus is crawling behind you.

[Speaker 3]
Holy shit, that's terrifying! Monk runs away.

[Speaker 1]
I'm listening for that. Alright, Monk... falls off the edge.

That's funny.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a monk, I get this.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I get it.

[Speaker 3]
Can anyone, um...

[Speaker 5]
give me light?

[Speaker 3]
Do you hear him give a soft baby scream as he runs away?

[Speaker 1]
And he's gonna take the opportunity, now that I say it. Boss, what are we, uh... Boss, what are we doing here?

[Speaker 3]
Who's that?

[Speaker 1]
That's Christopher Pineus, boss. Your loyal companion.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! So it is! So it is!

[Speaker 1]
I've restrained myself from singing in these quite dire circumstances, but... Fear not, I'll return to singing your praises soon enough.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like this conversation is him on his back as he fell, and he's just like... Chris is just standing over. Yes!

[Speaker 1]
Boss, if I fall off the edge, I just wanna go ahead first, you know?

[Speaker 3]
Good to know. I don't know why we're here. Yo, you guys, what are we doing?

Finding a dragon?

[Speaker 5]
We're slaying an ancient mythical beast!

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'm kinda new here, but I think we have to, uh... I think we're going hunting for one of them red dragons.

[Speaker 3]
We're hunting...

[Speaker 4]
a red...

[Speaker 2]
Probably young.

[Speaker 4]
Karis is only here because Kiwi would not shut up about this dragon. Boss, we're hunting...

[Speaker 5]
We're hunting... Oh, the dragon is most definitely an adult. Big and strong.

Just how I like him.

[Speaker 3]
How pathetic would it be if we just took care of a baby? It'd be like beating up a kid. That's pathetic.

[Speaker 6]
Rowan, during all this, like, during all this little mess, just looks amused.

[Speaker 3]
Anyway, we're fighting... We're fighting... something.

I got something in my eye. Sorry, that was nothing. I got something in my eye.

We're doing some... Oh, no, man. Go ask the people.

[Speaker 1]
I can't see.

[Speaker 6]
Some devil light.

[Speaker 1]
You seem kind of excited to... Yeah, yeah, I got a lantern here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, thank you. I also have a lantern. A hooded one.

[Speaker 3]
I was excited.

[Speaker 2]
Do the hooded one. Do the hooded one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this is a bullseye. I could close it as well. Let's see.

On, off. On, off. On, off.

[Speaker 3]
On, off, on, off, on, off, on, off.

[Speaker 1]
Charis, make me a perception check, and then, um, let's see here. I want... Dallas, I want you to make me an investigation check.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 6]
Practically sending a SOS signal to a blue dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Strobe light. Monk made a strobe light.

[Speaker 2]
My investigation is plus two. Yippee-doo-dah.

[Speaker 4]
Twelve. I feel like... I feel like that's not enough.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Oh, wow. By the way, I'd like to introduce myself.

My name's Randall Shelton.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, Shelly.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I see. Your roles don't go over until I click this other thing. That's fine.

Alright, so, Charis. Um, the notes are still just kind of around, but they look a little closer. And then, Randall, you're walking along, and you spot what looks to be a ward on this path.

A glyph of warding.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Gosh darn, I need to remind myself of this D&D stuff. Uh, glyph of warding.

That's like a common thing. I know what that is, right? What is it again?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, a glyph of warding. So, it's basically you found a magical trap.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, got it. I do not step on it.

[Speaker 4]
You should probably tell everyone.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Uh, guys. There's a glyph of warding somewhere around here.

I get you can't see, but try not to step on it. I'll tell you what. I'll stand right in front of it.

So that way, if you guys...

[Speaker 8]
What's a glyph of warding?

[Speaker 3]
I heard a warning. I want an a warning glyph. Okay.

Where is it?

[Speaker 2]
Randall will move to the side and say... But then we can sit on and be like... Honestly, I'll tell you if you're getting near it.

[Speaker 6]
Upon hearing that a glyph of warding is in the area... My guy is just going to communicate with the sickle to... Ask if it's detecting any glyph of warding traps near him.

[Speaker 2]
Huh?

[Speaker 6]
Since my sickle detects magic in a 10 feet radius.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know why. I just imagine you like cradling your sickle... And just like speaking to it with like very tiny lips.

[Speaker 3]
I'm picturing Gollum.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my gosh, yes. How crazy do you look talking to this thing?

[Speaker 3]
What's this scene here? Is it telepathic? No, it's speech.

Okay, so you are just talking to your sword. Your sickle, excuse me.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, people have heard it talk before.

[Speaker 2]
I think...

[Speaker 3]
I have not, Monk has not.

[Speaker 2]
I haven't.

[Speaker 3]
What is... What is this thing? I don't think Monk would care.

[Speaker 1]
I do need a slight clarification on what you're actually doing. Remember my moon sickle got the property... Remember, there's a billion magic items in this campaign.

[Speaker 6]
On the roll table, my moon sickle got the property of detecting magic in a 10 feet radius.

[Speaker 1]
Detecting magic in a 10 foot radius. Okay, so you activate the property. Get a little bit closer and it says...

And our colonist is left as a mark here. Clearly somebody doesn't want us nearby.

[Speaker 4]
Whoa. We're getting a lot closer to this dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Can I, I don't know what, can I make a check or like just basic intelligence to know if a dragon is capable of like etching a glyphal warding? I get they're smart, but I don't think they have the appendages to just- You can make me an Arcana check. Okay.

Because I want to know if this dragon has like cultists or worshipers helping it along.

[Speaker 1]
That's not something you're going to figure out from that check, but you got to make an Arcana check.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Plus five. I don't know what I rolled.

Hold on. You got 19.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay. There are dragons with spell casting ability.

Not all dragons can speak, not all dragons can even, not all dragons can cast spells very few of them can, and not all dragons can even speak, but those that do are powerful spellcasters.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. We're dealing with a pretty smart dragon here. I recommend we grab our most powerful of weapons and most versatile of methods to eliminate the, uh, this redded fiend.

[Speaker 1]
That's very verbose, I love him.

[Speaker 3]
It's right here. He shakes his staff and you just hear like metal, heavy metal clanging together because of his guns hanging off of it.

[Speaker 6]
I am very glad for the fact that I have the best batteries.

[Speaker 5]
Edmund is going to scratch his head in confusion.

[Speaker 1]
Kost, do you really think it's a good idea to shake the guns? In like a very literal fashion, do you think it's a good idea to shake the guns?

[Speaker 4]
Well, mine's been shaking around quite a bit and it hasn't gone off. Well, see, it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
I don't like it when she does it either.

[Speaker 4]
Well, it's never on purpose.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think any, well, that's kind of what I'm worried about.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay, okay. Fine, I won't shake my guns anymore. He does it quietly one last time.

It goes off.

[Speaker 1]
Just a minute.

[Speaker 3]
Bang!

[Speaker 1]
Both of us fired. What's up? Okay, so we are going to go here for a moment.

It's at this point that Randall notices a few BDIs staring down at the party from the side here. This is going to be our... Actually, why did I go with this one?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's just because our tokens aren't placed. I see a completely black screen. Yes, I am aware, guys.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, go back to thinking about what I was describing.

[Speaker 4]
Dragon. Nope. BDIs.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so we're going to do a very, very simple map here. You guys are going to be... There we go.

You guys go ahead and drop yourselves in the center of the map here.

[Speaker 4]
I hope. I can't see. It's dark.

Boop!

[Speaker 3]
Oh, look, there I am, right in the middle of nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Over here, this is your little pathway. On the side of the mountain, there are a few spires nearby. Randall...

Is that your name, Randall?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Okay. Uh...

Yes? No, I haven't programmed in my dark vision yet.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Uh, anyways... Uh, you can just add it in your senses.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I know.

[Speaker 1]
And, again, if you guys aren't doing dark vision here, you're doing... Everybody's doing sight out to 30 feet, because you have flashes of light here, and the progressive glow of lightning flashing through the clouds is giving you a little bit of additional vision here.

[Speaker 4]
So just go with vision range 30? Yep, just vision range 30. Okay.

Well, beautiful map.

[Speaker 7]
Incorrect.

[Speaker 1]
And so what Randall sees, sitting on top of this kind of shelf here, is a bunch of white humanoids that have like fur and these really gnarly, nasty teeth. They're almost like quadrupeds. They're hunched over.

And they are looking down. They're only briefly illuminated by flashes of lightning through the clouds here. What do you guys want to do?

[Speaker 4]
Kill whatever that is. Or go around it? No, we'll have to deal with it later.

[Speaker 1]
Murder! Shouldn't we start making some stealth checks here? I think we've already been spotted.

Now's a bad time to do that. Or maybe not. Maybe you do have a...

I don't know what you guys got up your sleeves. Pass without trace.

[Speaker 7]
That's not gonna help you in plain sight. That is true.

[Speaker 4]
I'm guessing they have darkvision.

[Speaker 1]
They are looking straight at you.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, so we can't hide no matter what. Let us fucking kill.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Then hear the music. I mean, I could be wrong.

I believe I get to go before initiative. Let's have for specific scenarios. I can...

[Speaker 1]
It's not what that says. Close, but it's your first time doing it, so that's not a problem. But yeah, basically you go first.

You do still roll initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my stomach hurts now. I'm sure that would not be the case. And I need to add an active encounter here.

So it looks like you guys noticed them. And you're getting ready to start firing away here. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
I think that means... We're rolling initiative. Nice one, Rowan.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, my god. Oh, what? How did that happen?

Oh, my...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no. Rowan, you have my... We're going to show initiative.

Thank you. And also... Who got 11?

Charis, you also have my initiative.

[Speaker 4]
What is your... Okay, 18.

[Speaker 3]
And then I... So we're all gonna be 18 except for the barbarians.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because the barbarians are giga-chad.

[Speaker 3]
It almost feels like him and Monk share the same brain cell, which is gonna be fun.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 6]
The pain of having at least seven dexterity.

[Speaker 3]
Monk has a lot of dexterity.

[Speaker 2]
I see the dragon, right?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we see a dragon right now.

[Speaker 3]
We don't see... We see the critters. We see its crew.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, so...

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna fucking cry if you can fall off the map here.

[Speaker 1]
Can that be edited to 18?

[Speaker 8]
Well, this is...

[Speaker 1]
What you do is you right-click on your initiative.

[Speaker 3]
They're up on a cliff, right? And this is, like, you have to climb up it to get to them?

[Speaker 1]
They are 20 feet up.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I'm pretty sure...

[Speaker 1]
There's a little bit of an overhang.

[Speaker 5]
Perfect for Edmund.

[Speaker 1]
What I mean is that, like, the cliff to some extent, like, extends... The very top of the shelf extends a little bit past the bottom. But if you're in this kind of, like, in-between space here, then...

Alright, Rowan, I assume that it didn't work when you tried to update your initiative. Yeah, I tried. Alright, then.

Who else was getting the 18?

[Speaker 3]
Caris.

[Speaker 2]
Caris.

[Speaker 1]
Update. Cool. And then, Randall, you go first.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. This is... This is, like, a cliffside, right?

That's correct. I can still climb it. I have a climbing speed because of Daft Explore Roving.

So...

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it's 20 feet up.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, 20 feet up. I have a movement speed of 35. Okay, no, let's just keep it simple.

My gun should be able to reach from there. It goes... Range of 60.

[Speaker 1]
I am going to provide them with some cover here for kind of leaning over the cliffside.

[Speaker 2]
We'll do half cover, unless you have Sharpshooter, of course, which would fix their cover benefits. No, I sadly do not. Yeah, you know what?

Yeah, let's not...

[Speaker 1]
Caris, go ahead and roll.

[Speaker 2]
Let's just shoot them in an area. I think I can just reach from here, but... You know what?

I am going to stop my ascent.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, are you shooting, or are you...

[Speaker 2]
What are you doing? Oh, if I... You know what?

Yeah, I should shoot first, then move.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, let me make this perfectly clear. You need to commit to an action, and then roll it right now.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Alright. Okay.

Okay. By the way, I don't know if it does sit right automatically. There you go, that hits.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Hook damage. In the rolls section of Foundry.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, good, it does remember to add the two because the jet rounds. Six damage.

[Speaker 7]
Cool, cool. And then as my movement, which I am confirming that I'm doing...

[Speaker 1]
Anything else with your regular action or bonus action here? I don't mind if people handle movement on somebody else's turn, I guess that's why I ask. If there's nothing else you want to do on your turn, I'll move on to somebody else, and then you can finish.

Yeah, nothing else.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, good, decent, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Edmund.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, this combat chart, oh. Okay, that's cool. Um, okay.

I'm not so sure on the rules for climbing, but I think it's healthier.

[Speaker 1]
Unless you have a climbing speed.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, 20 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me an athletics check.

[Speaker 5]
Of course. Lovely.

[Speaker 1]
You're good.

[Speaker 5]
Bonus action, rage. I can find the damn thing. There we go.

And now, I'm going to use Ember of the Fire Giant on this one, this one, this one, and this one. So these four.

[Speaker 1]
Have to make dex saves, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yep, the DC is 16.

[Speaker 1]
And then, is that just enemies, or is that everybody?

[Speaker 5]
All the creatures I chose. Each creature of my choice.

[Speaker 1]
That's striking the giants. Oh, that's a feat, that's pretty cool.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I love it. I was like, so excited to use this.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, one success.

[Speaker 5]
And the ones who fail, they take six damage and are blinded, and the one who succeeds takes half damage. So, three fire.

[Speaker 1]
Well, anything else with your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Um, yes. I'm going to use my bonus attack. On this one.

I think extra attack works with this.

[Speaker 1]
No, if this uses your action... Wait, um... You can replace a single...

No, you're right. You can replace a single attack with the Magical Burst of Flame. Yes, no, you are correct.

That's cool. You finally added a... You roll an attack.

You know how to roll attacks. Yeah. I know you know how to roll attacks.

You know that I know you know how to roll attacks.

[Speaker 5]
And I'm going to Reckless this.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay, cool.

[Speaker 5]
Seventeen damage.

[Speaker 1]
Seventeen damage. Looking pretty bad.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, alright, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Cool, excellent. Coming out to A. And when are they blinded until?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, they are blinded... Until the start of my next turn.

[Speaker 1]
The start of your next turn. Okay. This guy is just going to attempt to...

Attack you. Twice.

[Speaker 5]
He also gets advantage.

[Speaker 1]
He sure does. Oh, why is it marked as... No, don't mark it as private.

You stupid...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was going to point that out. Not sure if you did that on purpose.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see. Alright, it was a 22 and a 23 to hit for... Eight and seven damage there.

[Speaker 5]
Eight and seven. Cut in half. So that would be...

I could just do this. Apply half.

[Speaker 1]
Apply half. Alright, this thing is... Blinded.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, you tickled!

[Speaker 1]
It's going to cast Mirror Image on itself. Which is hilarious to me. Okay, Monk, you are up next.

[Speaker 7]
Monk is muted. Possibly.

[Speaker 1]
Possibly muted.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no, they said they got to check on the kid.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no worries. Hopefully it wouldn't take too long. Okay, in that case, Charis.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. I'm going to fly up. And I'm not going to fly up to them, but I will fly in the direction of up.

And I will use my gun.

[Speaker 1]
Big fan.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, fuck. Gotta manually do it, of course. Okay, so it's a plus three.

Okay, well. I didn't even add my modifiers to it and got a one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that does kind of suck. Anything you'd like to do with your bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
I will stay here. Yeah, no, I'm good. Actually, hold on.

Yeah, I will... Bardic Inspiration. Randall.

I am back. Welcome back.

[Speaker 1]
Good timing, too.

[Speaker 3]
Monk.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
What the hell is my Bardic Inspiration?

[Speaker 3]
I can climb up that. I'm going to climb up that.

[Speaker 1]
That's pretty good at climbing.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, do I gotta do acrobatic? Or athletic?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me either athletic. I'll let you choose.

[Speaker 3]
Cool.

[Speaker 8]
I'll let you choose.

[Speaker 1]
How much did you get?

[Speaker 3]
I got 20.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're good to go.

[Speaker 3]
Is that just my movement, or is that also an action?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's just your movement. It's basically like a saving throw, but for an environmental end. There are all these sharp and spiky bits that, as you run up, you notice they appear to be producing a little bit of electricity.

[Speaker 3]
I can go real fast, guys!

[Speaker 1]
Okay, everybody with a blinded token is blinded. I think this one is also blinded.

[Speaker 5]
Nope.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You're blinded three out of four. Nope, nope.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, alright, because one succeeded.

[Speaker 1]
How dare you.

[Speaker 3]
25 hits.

[Speaker 1]
25 definitely hits.

[Speaker 3]
Which one are you targeting?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you have advantage on that, by the way. You're blinded.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Blinded, you have advantage. I'll pass on this one.

Okay. It's all good. Yeah, my quarterstaff of certain death stops creatures from regenerating health.

22 hit.

[Speaker 1]
22 absolutely hits.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, and then... I can attack my bonus action, right? Or is that just rogue?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, not only do you have your regular bonus action attack, you also have Flurry of Blows.

[Speaker 8]
I do.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not going to do that at all.

[Speaker 3]
Does 16 hit?

[Speaker 1]
16... does hit.

[Speaker 3]
Woo woo woo!

[Speaker 1]
Damage. He is... What's his calculation supposed to be?

Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He is donezo, done for, gone.

[Speaker 7]
Woo!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, anything else on your turn?

[Speaker 3]
Nope, nope, I'm good. That was it.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Okay, that's going to bring us to... Randall went at the start of the round, so...

I'm going to go to... Charis. Already also win.

Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Bring us to Rowan. Alright, Misty. Then I'm just going to do...

[Speaker 1]
Hits. Damage. Oh, wait a second.

Hold on a second. I have Mirror Image on. Tursi with an attack.

Three duplicates. Okay, you hit a duplicate instead. Excellent.

Alright. Clear them down, one by one.

[Speaker 6]
Since I used my action, my bonus action...

[Speaker 1]
End of turn. Do you have anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 6]
I already just did. Misty's stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, gotcha, gotcha. Okay. I have another Thot.

Quaggath Thot. Just going to cast... Probably cast Mirror Image on himself.

That's probably the smart thing to do. I have this other Quaggath who is... Blind.

So you have not gone. And so it is going to... It's kind of on the edge here.

I'm just going to make a Dex save. DC of 10. Makes it.

Not going to fall over the edge. He's going to just start kind of like shoving rocks... Off as...

Let's see here. Go ahead and make me a... Strength saving throw, Randall.

[Speaker 2]
Strength or Dexterity saving throw. Your choice. Definitely...

Well, let me see. Probably Dexed. Yeah, definitely Dexed.

What Donov did I roll? Very good. A 22, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Going to take 9 bludgeoning damage as he starts just like tossing rocks down and shoving them off.

[Speaker 2]
Not enough.

[Speaker 1]
But you do not fall and then take additional damage. Bringing us to the start of the next round with Edmund. And these people are no longer blinded.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. While I make my turn, I love the new tracker thing.

[Speaker 4]
It's really cool. Yeah, that's cool.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I'm going to use...

[Speaker 1]
Mushroom had some very good, very good recommendations. I can't wait to see what he does when he runs.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I'm using this again. On the 4 Quaggoths.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
7 points of fire damage. I need 4 Dex saves. Alright, so...

2 take half and the other take full and are blinded. Beautiful. No deaths.

No deaths. And then I'm going to smack this one. Not reckless because it's blinded.

Do you get advantage against blinded targets just by default?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
16 hits. 16 damage.

[Speaker 1]
That was Grinder, I know that notification show.

[Speaker 7]
Do you?

[Speaker 1]
What's wrong with that?

[Speaker 3]
Nothing for me, I just wanted to make a bit.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. Collaborative bit. Okay, well, we're rolling.

[Speaker 5]
I think I attacked a Quaggoth who had mirror image, so I think you have to roll for the mirror image.

[Speaker 1]
You're completely correct. Oh, goddammit. Must roll an 8 or higher.

So it misses. Alright.

[Speaker 5]
That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. That brings us to the next Quaggoth. He's just going to...

No, that's fine. He's going to attempt to... Disadvantage.

Disadvantage. Attack disadvantage. Ooh, that one hits.

Damage. Alright. 4.

[Speaker 5]
I take 2.

[Speaker 1]
And we come to the Faunet. Ooh, he's quite low on HP. Which is great, because it's going to cancel out his disadvantage.

Wounded Fury. Ooh. Yeah, Fury makes some regular attack rolls.

Miss. Also misses. That's not going to help him any.

Bringing us to Monk.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that one's not blind, so that's just normal. Oh, bummer. Why didn't you blind this one, too?

[Speaker 1]
How dare you. Alright, he's going to... What is Crystal Rapidius?

Is he like a minstrel, or is he an entertainer?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I think he's just an entertainer.

[Speaker 3]
Monk doesn't know anything about him. You're the one that created him.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah?

[Speaker 3]
You told me about him.

[Speaker 1]
You went Coralic every single week.

[Speaker 3]
I did, didn't I?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so this guy has the mirror image thing active. He's not taking any... Yeah, alright, so he loses one mirror image.

Anything you'd like to do with your bonus action?

[Speaker 3]
Um... I don't really want to spend my ki on these guys. Just kidding!

Death is my turn. I'll blow a raspberry at him instead.

[Speaker 1]
Crystal Rapidius joins in and says, You almost got him, boss. You got him on the ropes.

[Speaker 3]
Eh, no.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, now it's your turn, Randall. There was this guy named Humpty Dumpty. I don't know if you heard the story.

No. Movement action, climb up ten feet.

[Speaker 1]
The victim of a hate crime.

[Speaker 2]
I move here, basically. One thing about the end of the story is, it teaches you a lesson. Don't stand off the ledge!

I'm going to use a bonus action, Shield Master, and shove this guy five feet... Five feet off the cliff.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
You have advantage on the check.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds, strictly speaking, attack roll, but circumstances...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I need to get up... Let me get up this thing so that way I know what it is.

[Speaker 1]
No, just... So just roll... Go ahead and roll your check there.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... DC's 13 dex... Oh, no.

I rolled the attack.

[Speaker 1]
What does it have to do? Okay. Um...

Nope, he has to make the save.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't think I do anything.

[Speaker 1]
If you take the attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, so you have to attack.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I have to attack him first.

[Speaker 5]
Doesn't matter if you hit or miss.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, uh... Would you allow me to, while I was climbing, switch my gun with my Venom Daigo? Um...

Or should I... I'm fine if I have the issue of disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't that either use an object interaction or a free action? Well, no, it's an object interaction, so to pull your gun out and then put it back.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, but then grab my Daigo Venom.

[Speaker 1]
Right. That you can't do. You need, like, another action at that point to pull it out.

[Speaker 2]
In that case, I will just use my pistol of disadvantage, which evens out to be just normal, I believe. Right?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this one's not blinded, so just go ahead and roll the attack.

[Speaker 2]
With disadvantage? Yes. With disadvantage, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, why do you have, like, an afterimage over there? Oh, I know why, I know why. It's because you moved your character.

That's what it does. Normally now.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, does 12 hit?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 12 does not hit, no.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, uh, shove him five feet off the cliff.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, attack save time. She just barely makes it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. That was disappointing.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a second attack?

[Speaker 2]
I do have extra attack. I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go ahead and shoot.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm just going to shoot him again. Uh, usability. I should have just knocked him prone instead, but, uh, what are you going to do?

[Speaker 1]
There's also grappling. You can take that, Joe. Uh, I want you to, um...

[Speaker 2]
14, does that hit?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Does it show you guys the little... Yes, it does hit.

Does it show you guys the little green checkmark in, uh, in chat when it's a successful hit?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no.

[Speaker 1]
What? Unfortunate. I find that so...

[Speaker 2]
I think it's just a custom-made thing that I made myself.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, so that's not, uh... That's why I'm asking. There's something that shows me whether it...

Uh, that checks the AC automatically.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, he takes 10 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I don't see that either. 10 damage. Okay, good.

[Speaker 2]
10 feet. 20 feet. Uh...

Oh god, I didn't even realize I was next to this guy. Okay, uh...

[Speaker 1]
And that will...

[Speaker 2]
Probably kill him.

[Speaker 1]
I need to apply my chillness mentally. It points adjustments to these guys, but it'll be handy. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
That's gonna bring us to Charis. Alright. Um, I'm going to...

Hideous Laughter. Wait, what are the effects? What is...

What are the effects on this guy?

[Speaker 1]
Hideous Laughter just, like, completely incapacitates them.

[Speaker 4]
Well, no, I mean, like, what effects does he already have on him?

[Speaker 1]
He's got, um... So he's got... Blinded.

And he's got, uh, Mirror Image. And I think he still has a Mirror Image up. And then the other guy has two Mirror Images up.

So basically, there's a chance that even if you hit that guy, that it still just misses automatically.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna try anyway. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have advantage on the attack?

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Did it... Did it roll?

No. What? Hold on.

It didn't roll. Um... Let's try this again.

Did that roll?

[Speaker 1]
Is anybody else seeing it?

[Speaker 4]
No, I'm not seeing it. That's... Strange.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna reload.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not seeing it either. I'm gonna reload. See if that fixes it.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to roll two D20s for you in the meantime. Apply your bonus to it. Oh yeah.

Natural 17. That's definitely gonna hit. And then I'm gonna have him roll a D20.

He has to beat an 11. That's a new macro that does nothing. Okay, so your shot will hit the...

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
The thingy.

[Speaker 4]
And then I'm going to shoot the one next to him. Because I can do that with this gun. Um...

And that's just... Alright. We'll do a D20 to start out with.

And I think my modifier's a plus three.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. And he is still blinded.

[Speaker 4]
Does that hit?

[Speaker 1]
AC is 13.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. And then that is a... 3D10.

3D10... That's already yours.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, I had you select it. Okay, so his thing does not go... Also, that's just a regular claw gun, so it doesn't get the thing.

You might actually kill him. 3D10 plus, I think, your charisma modifier, plus three.

[Speaker 4]
Plus my charisma modifier?

[Speaker 1]
I think you also have charisma.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, because it's a firearm.

[Speaker 1]
You add your ability modifier.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
This would normally be X, but this one is...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, when I say plus three, that's a plus three enchantment, not a plus three period.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I was going off my dex, which is a plus three, so... But my charisma is a plus five, so... We are good.

And that will be my go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. And then... Oh, 17 total.

Yeah, he's done for.

[Speaker 4]
The other guy's laughing hysterically on the ground.

[Speaker 3]
How brutal.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, did you cast Conscious Hideous Laughter? Is that like a bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
No, my bonus action was using the gun. Oh, okay. Hell yeah.

I wanted to make the guy next to him laugh.

[Speaker 1]
I got really confused there. I thought you made two attacks.

[Speaker 4]
And it's gonna be hell. I got really confused there. Imagine dying and your best friend is just laughing hysterically beside you.

Like, that's horrible.

[Speaker 6]
That drama's gonna follow you into the afterlife.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so walk me through, because I thought you made two attacks. That's weird. And then this guy is...

I never made the saving throw. Does he get a saving throw? He's not gonna make it anyway.

He's got plus one to wisdom.

[Speaker 4]
So I did the Hideous Laughter, which is an enchantment. And then I shot him with my gun, which when you do an enchantment or illusion spell, you can... Nice.

That's right, you do it with a bonus action. A bonus action.

[Speaker 5]
That was a cool fucking gun.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, a space gun.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so that guy is currently incapacitated and on the ground.

[Speaker 4]
My trusty space gun.

[Speaker 1]
It is a cool fucking gun. Okay, keep rolling after that.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, there is literally no point to be using Flaming Sphere here, because... So, skittle. Chill touch.

[Speaker 1]
So, mirror image. 20 and 11, which he does not... Remember, always draw your damage at the same time.

That's just sad damage. Fine damage. Okay.

Alright, and then we got this one, who is not hideously laughtered. Going to cast... On Hitman.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe he still got hit. Alright, cool. Eat metal.

Why does that show up? It does not show up?

[Speaker 7]
Alright, clearly I need to reload as well. So I'm going to wait for that to happen. Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

It's not in characters, just rolls. So, we come now to figure out... Come now at the turn of time.

Open your goddamn smartphone. Anyways, make me a con save, make me a con save.

[Speaker 1]
What's your face?

[Speaker 5]
Edmund.

[Speaker 1]
Edmund.

[Speaker 5]
26. That's a success.

[Speaker 1]
yes okay I don't know if you could see the billion heat metals I'm trying to

[Speaker 5]
spam there um I can't do you need to be like wearing something metal for heat

[Speaker 1]
metal to work you need a holding a axe or something else it's metal ouch that's

[Speaker 4]
never gonna work on monk your hands are gonna need some aloe vera or some dirt

[Speaker 3]
I got you just slap some mud on it either way my characters heavily

[Speaker 5]
resistant to fire damage even when he's not raging so we'll be fine did I take any damage okay I'm gonna reckless the attack for these two both hit this one's taking the nine and I'm attempting to hit this one with the 18

[Speaker 1]
that's one with Tasha cities laughter on it so it's not currently let's see all right so that does hit and kills it next one then what was the damage on the second one 18 my damage okay I'm going to it is going to surrender you guys can

[Speaker 2]
decide whether or not you kill it kill it no wait wait whoa whoa whoa and I get a is this something I could tame this is something where you guys can decide

[Speaker 1]
right this second whether you are killing it or keeping it alive as a

[Speaker 2]
your honor death okay I don't think I can keep it as a pet I think it's too

[Speaker 1]
sentient all right we have one vote in favor of death what is it like you know

[Speaker 4]
what I he's been through a lot I think the best thing if it tries to kill thee

[Speaker 1]
we kill it instead it looks like he's been up through a lot we should put a melon's misery yes I see now why I now see why fog of that wants to move to

[Speaker 2]
Germany makes a lot more sense now yeah just just make it quick twist this neck off like a bottle cap I'm gonna make a roll just for immersiveness I'm gonna

[Speaker 3]
snap his neck well they're killing monk wants to touch the rocks that look like they could shock him he's gonna like lean over the edge in the side and try to

[Speaker 1]
touch one yeah you touch one your hair starts standing up

[Speaker 3]
oh like it's gonna happen anyway thank god I'm fucking raging enough repaired hey hey gopher look at my hair standing up but that's his

[Speaker 1]
16 check takes 25 lightning damage I did not hear that my headphones

[Speaker 3]
disconnected bunch of me that's like 25 lightning damage all right it didn't get

[Speaker 5]
over 16 he didn't meet the 16 could I use stones endurance for this my

[Speaker 1]
reaction yeah I don't see why not it's unless stones endurance if stones

[Speaker 5]
endurance is for any damage then yes when you take damage okay so any damage yep all right so I'm gonna apply a half that'd be 12 or 13 minus 5 7 I'll lower

[Speaker 1]
or higher just okay click right right click and click apply half that's you

[Speaker 2]
already have the tool to my friends I take five points is it just Rowan who

[Speaker 3]
has to mix this safe anybody who did not get oh everybody has to make I said I

[Speaker 1]
definitely said everybody Christopher except Christopher Pinneas who's currently hiding beneath a has been hiding beneath shelter this entire time

[Speaker 2]
nope is it a dexterity saving throw yes still dexterity saving throw react I believe I can spend a reaction for shield master to allow me to have you

[Speaker 1]
still have to roll the saving throw yes oh I can you can add if you are not in

[Speaker 6]
capacity you can add your shields AC bonus to any dexterities saving throw

[Speaker 5]
you'd make against this spell or other harmful effect that targets only you so

[Speaker 2]
you would not be able to apply it oh got it okay and technically speaking this it's individual lightning bolts that target okay so I get to add to this

[Speaker 1]
whatever I roll yes okay I'm gonna give you a brief piece of advice when somebody tells you to roll just immediately roll that's all Detroit you don't know the bonus immediately rolled each one a we can stack up the bonuses later but I don't want to spend light this is something I go over with people in the tutorial dungeons is immediately roll we're not waiting 10 minutes to stack up bonuses just make things happen because you make it maybe you roll a 20 immediately and I say okay well it doesn't matter what bonuses you're gonna it's just gonna succeed okay now at this point Paris the little lightning notes that you've been seeing around switch from F to G email yes everybody's cover of the black parade that's what you think but yeah there we go okay so you see a very small just note that grows larger and larger in size and a small like tunnel throughout the fog and clouds here that parts to reveal two things the first is a tower about three stories in height and the second is a cave the tower has little boats has a lightning rod on top and several array of smaller lightning rods that are kind of that are arranged almost like a crown on top of the tower itself I think he's in the tower oh well

[Speaker 4]
it's lightning to the mighty dragon has a home he is a dragon he will make a trophy we could always use them to I don't know he's not walking out of here alive I don't think he be would be very happy with me I don't think the dragon

[Speaker 2]
has the lease on this building I think it's our right to kill you know that did

[Speaker 6]
the Kreygoths count as humanoid for the purposes of animate dead or they do all

[Speaker 1]
that are specifically humanoids oh good you want to raise some spores on these

[Speaker 3]
all right fungal infestation it is I've seen that before that that no got some

[Speaker 1]
clickers at this point it's gonna be about 10 p.m. it's gonna be 1010 all right

[Speaker 6]
everyone onwards to the tower hello I'll have my little zombie go you know first ahead of everybody yeah so that way if there's a trap I can just have my zombie spring it sound be all right how many hit points does it zombie have one okay

[Speaker 1]
fungal infestation zombie you watch as a pillar of like a red sprite erupts just

[Speaker 6]
out of the ground and upwards this is why it's a good thing to have you know

[Speaker 5]
disposable bodies you reckon I could walk through that yeah oh really I don't

[Speaker 4]
think so it might be I mean he could he could walk through it but will he make

[Speaker 3]
it so for him to figure out wait actually hang on was that radiant damage

[Speaker 4]
nope are there dragons that do damage I'm dead fortitude oh so how much

[Speaker 1]
damage to the tank hey what what did we just go over like I want to say like I'm sorry I forgot about that feature I only just now okay yeah it there's no way to make it okay all right no the not about the it's not about the feature is about like you have to make a roll you know that you have to make a roll make the room sorry it's fine I am I'm really encouraging you yeah I keep hearing these

[Speaker 6]
but I need to actually like internalize and do it in practice right so the way is

[Speaker 5]
blocked there is you look smart any ideas

[Speaker 4]
could I fly around it what exactly is it sorry he walked into a basically the

[Speaker 1]
fungal zombie walked into a ward and it had a bad day and will not be going to

[Speaker 2]
space today okay but the wards deactivated now right oh you know somebody I'll need to spell them okay I'm not taking chances okay if I play

[Speaker 1]
over words will they go off now words are triggered by the caster or sorry by the caster's instructions oh so he knows we're here okay well also be pre-programmed yeah they're exclusively pre-programmed oh yeah it's like it's

[Speaker 6]
like when you open the door and the bell rings so in theory one could set up a system where like a bunch of war like wards could activate given a specific

[Speaker 1]
alarm in a location in a case it doesn't appear that the dispel magic had any effect it was expended oh one time use perfect let's go do you have any more

[Speaker 6]
of those zombies need their corpses be a little bit more fresh they're still like

[Speaker 2]
the bodies are already decaying when you're putting down your traps you usually you can always put down more but three is the magic number I say keep a lookout for any more of these rotten little sigils oh yes that's that's why

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna trust my little sickle to detect it for me and yes I am activating

[Speaker 3]
that property all right then you go monks gonna push him first you're the

[Speaker 6]
leader oh go forth that remember the detect magic property of the circle

[Speaker 1]
tech magic yeah cool all right you see do figure out additional there we go you do see some additional sigils nearby mostly on the path it appears as though there's a path off to the side that curves around and behind the wizard tower that because at this point you can see it's very fluidly magical

[Speaker 6]
curves around and behind the tower any invisible objects or traps of a large

[Speaker 1]
size and 10 feet as well mundane traps no invisible objects yes there is a scrying eye that's situated outside the front door of the of the mage tower and additionally there is an invisible bridge that leads from this kind of back path over to the second floor of the mage tower interesting overlay this

[Speaker 4]
information with the rest of the party oh we should go with the bridge the

[Speaker 5]
way you're the you're the magic man all right I'll lead the way is anybody

[Speaker 4]
healing oh could we short rest because I can heal everybody yes heal in the

[Speaker 6]
middle of us before we go through this weird-ass maze we got heal I want to say

[Speaker 5]
this is a horrible idea like completely our character this is a horrible idea we

[Speaker 3]
all just got zapped if we backtracked I have healing stuff if we backtrack okay but do we want to spend that much time we're gonna fight a dragon

[Speaker 4]
Saris has less than half health I do have a potion but I would like to use that in battle so but I have song of rest so I can do a performance and as long as I don't rule one I think we'll be good I fuck it

[Speaker 5]
let's do it yeah I have aura vitality wait you have aura vitality yeah

[Speaker 6]
remember it's part of the druid expended spells from Tasha's yeah we got a from

[Speaker 5]
there okay let's just use that that's that makes everything simpler we don't

[Speaker 1]
need to rest for that just cast it and then is there anything else that somebody

[Speaker 2]
wants to rest for I don't think so I just know that we need to make sure our

[Speaker 3]
health is good before we go into that dragon or a vitality will do that okay then let's cast that but in this game you know if you're using spells or doing

[Speaker 1]
stuff you actively get it up okay also short rest we're still identically technically speaking okay that's 2d 6 times 10 and that will last for a full

[Speaker 6]
what minute and that's well that's 2d 6 plus a d4 from my moon circle each time

[Speaker 5]
damn so that's you can use that 10 times I mean I think that's healing for

[Speaker 6]
the whole party I don't think no it's what it's one creature in the area so

[Speaker 3]
choose whether it on Sarah's all right I know so you can use a bonus action to

[Speaker 5]
cause one creature in the aura so you could use that ten times on different

[Speaker 1]
creatures yeah but the point is that you have to choose oh well fast monk

[Speaker 4]
does not need healing so we're good this gives you an extra take the 14 and then

[Speaker 3]
you Sarah's camp the rest oh like all of these will stack up on her everything except the 14 okay okay hang on hang on let's do the math because if she's all

[Speaker 4]
full then you don't have to roll all of them and the other eight and I think that will fill me up so the rest of them all right seven and the eleven you can

[Speaker 6]
keep to yourself who needs the 7-eleven nobody I don't think so all right good that's good that's good use of aura vitality let's get moving

[Speaker 4]
yeah we're good just pretend that I did not use my thing so we're going to

[Speaker 5]
follow the hidden path revealed by growing bridge all right right now I'll

[Speaker 1]
be constantly okay keep my nobody else can see this so we're just gonna be

[Speaker 6]
following Rowan so follow very closely behind me single fine may I suggest a

[Speaker 4]
line of shorts I'm just gonna fly you guys have fun with your legs make sure

[Speaker 2]
you fly over the bridge just in case there's something shoots you down you

[Speaker 1]
still land on the invisible bridge okay so the you guys make it over to the tower there's no obvious entrance just goes kind of into the tower can someone

[Speaker 4]
with high investigation see if there's like a hidden wall door yes indeed they

[Speaker 1]
can and that is we're gonna take a brief break all right I was going to offer to

[Speaker 5]
use my sledgehammer trying to smash up at the wall I can turn to a giant carry

[Speaker 6]
people slowly one by one up don't think monk in your barbarian are good at least

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi's not here a brain so we have to pass between three people yeah that's

[Speaker 1]
exhausting get shit done oh yeah I'm free Karis did you which of your no frog if they you were there from the which of your characters was at the tower of the rogue wizard oh god was it I don't think it was Kiwi it wasn't

[Speaker 4]
Kiwi no it was either Karis or Edith I think what kind of wizard were there

[Speaker 1]
they were actually ended up getting much return wait no they did get a turn this is the one that were there when the tower disappeared they it left a portal behind

[Speaker 4]
we got the dark I think it might have been Karis because we I had to like fly and look in windows and stuff you're right it was Karis or she would

[Speaker 7]
recognize this place oh my god wait this is the tower yeah okay yeah I was just trying to aggressively make use of the resources I have access to hopefully the

[Speaker 6]
use of aura vitality will work out well oh yeah it's already been helpful you

[Speaker 3]
just don't have to roll all of it right away make sure that

[Speaker 8]
I

[Speaker 4]
sure how the storm sounds so beautiful outside yeah it's daytime so that I can

[Speaker 3]
watch it yeah we watched for the lightning which we got a fair bit amount

[Speaker 1]
what are we checking check on the Congress oh we wait sorry don't you guys are attempting an intelligence check you guys can actually figure your way inside when somebody does that I'm going to ask them for details on how

[Speaker 3]
anybody have good intelligence I have a monk has a plus two intelligence plus

[Speaker 6]
I have a plus 11 in arcana I think arcana might be best because this is a

[Speaker 4]
wizards tower I would have

[Speaker 6]
that's one of those old schools

[Speaker 5]
James you said there's a it's like a wall like there's no apparent way in

[Speaker 1]
yes it's the wall I'm trying to smash it with a sledgehammer

[Speaker 6]
the district that be very noisy and doesn't attract attention from what

[Speaker 3]
levers I was gonna say trap that too

[Speaker 5]
I don't think that'd do anything I'm gonna like smack the wall in my unders my blows gonna ricochet back is

[Speaker 6]
there is there any cracks anywhere that like allows to get like a small peak inside

[Speaker 1]
champ

[Speaker 5]
could I try and maybe climb it with that for us and do what I don't know I'm

[Speaker 1]
trying to get through the door right it's trying to well there's there's no doors the problem so somebody suggested

[Speaker 3]
okay look the plus three was intelligent here

[Speaker 6]
yeah I have a plus three to investigation but plus nine perception

[Speaker 2]
true we already see What is to be seen is just an abandoned wizard tower. We know there's hidden entries and secrets inside the wizard, but the architecture is very eccentric.

I may just do the check, if you know what I mean.

[Speaker 3]
Go for it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, just do it. We have nothing to lose. Wait a minute.

If somebody's proficient in investigation, can't they give me help action?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, someone help him. I guess.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, sure. I guess I will.

[Speaker 5]
Probably.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know how good my investigation will be to help you, but sure.

[Speaker 2]
You just give them an advantage.

[Speaker 3]
Sure. My cheerleader... And how are you doing this?

[Speaker 7]
Describe to me your action.

[Speaker 3]
I cheerleader throw him up in the air so he can get a better advantage. No, sorry, the way that he's doing this. Because I was supposed to be helping him, so there it is.

[Speaker 6]
You could also give Bart a conspiration to just ensure it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I could give Bart a conspiration. Okay, that's a better one.

[Speaker 2]
I think we're overestimating this DC.

[Speaker 3]
No, I'm asking you...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, again, I'm...

[Speaker 4]
How are you looking at the tower?

[Speaker 1]
Welcome to the wonderful world of random encounters.

[Speaker 4]
He's smashing the wall, right? No.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody's doing something. Investigation. Yes, but how?

What are you investigating in? How are you doing it?

[Speaker 4]
Investigate the bricks in the walls.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Randall? Yeah? How are you investigating?

The clock's ticking away, my dude. How are you investigating the tower?

[Speaker 2]
I didn't make any roll.

[Speaker 1]
You said that you were investigating.

[Speaker 2]
Sure, I guess I'll do a check.

[Speaker 1]
Well, who was investigating then?

[Speaker 3]
Randall, I...

[Speaker 1]
I appreciate... Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm gonna investigate. I'm just gonna look.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, just do it. Someone, please. Alright, and Nessie, how are you doing this?

[Speaker 4]
You also get a 1d10. Okay. And also get a 15.

Honestly, a monk would be climbing the shit out of this wall.

[Speaker 3]
Out of this tower. He'd just be climbing up.

[Speaker 1]
Just kinda feeling all over the place. Okay. That's a 17.

In total for you, because Bardic Inspiration wants my diamonds. Yeah, no, that's good. You start climbing all over.

Apparently there was a secret brick that gets depressed.

[Speaker 2]
A poor brick. Awful.

[Speaker 1]
There's a brick that gets depressed. And the door swings open. You are inside a wizard tower.

And Charis, it looks like this place is only three stories at the moment. Because actually, the two bottom floors, you're able to tell at this point, have been sunk. Yeah, there we go.

Because they've been sunk into the ground.

[Speaker 4]
Strange. This place had more levels the last time I was here.

[Speaker 1]
And you recall that the last time you were in the fourth floor, which is what this technically is, it was a large marble room with a few columns in the center. Or sorry, a few columns surrounding or on the edges. Maybe I guess technically they're pillars.

But, in this case, they're actually... Uh... Or sorry, instead of the...

There we go. It's a chamber with some rather cold stone walls that kind of just close in on you. And in the center of this room, there's, instead of a white pedestal that's made of marble, it's obsidian with a large open grimoire.

Pages that just kind of occasionally flutter back and forth.

[Speaker 4]
Strange.

[Speaker 3]
Unless anybody stops him, Monk is going to touch it.

[Speaker 4]
Monk, Monk, hold on. Hold on, Monk.

[Speaker 3]
Huh?

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, Monk. We don't need to go touching things in a wizard's tower. It's flippin', that's cool.

It is, but you can admire it from afar. We should probably check it for damage.

[Speaker 5]
Edmund is dumb, he'd probably try and break it.

[Speaker 3]
Well, if Monk can't do it, he's gonna stop Edmund from doing it. So we're good, let's just check the damn book.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm gonna use my sickle to have it, you know, use it to detect magic property, see if it can sell me. If it's not dangerous, then we collect it and sell it because that's probably a wizard's spell book.

[Speaker 4]
Or we use it. Was this the wizard that was, like, caught in a loop? Kind of?

The wizard tower that was caught in a loop?

[Speaker 1]
The wizard tower that was caught in a loop? Absolutely it was.

[Speaker 4]
Um, because I found the summary. I found the session summary. Where should I tag it?

Just so people know.

[Speaker 1]
Um, tag it in... I want to say Pyphus Smuggler's Quest, or you can make a new thread for Dragon Hunt.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know how to make...

[Speaker 1]
A new post?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

[Speaker 1]
I know, it's super easy. But actually, go ahead and tag it... Here, tag it in VoiceOverFlow for the moment, and then I can make a new post later.

[Speaker 4]
I hope this is how you do... Okay, did that... Did that work?

Okay, that did work.

[Speaker 2]
It's fine to me. Yeah, I'm getting some, uh... I'm getting some, uh, vibes of fire about to come towards us.

I'm going to grab my heat sap discus and equip that. Uh, did people already grab the book?

[Speaker 3]
No, no one's grabbed the book. It was a joke.

[Speaker 4]
The book is untouched.

[Speaker 6]
I'm just waiting until my sickle tells me what it's detecting.

[Speaker 4]
I think it's very shiny. Well, not literally shiny, but it's very, um, out there. And if we grab it, we will...

[Speaker 1]
Your sickle detects magic. Because this is a wizard tower, and it's magic all over.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but what school?

[Speaker 2]
Can it also detect danger? Oh, no, I'm thinking of a different sickle.

[Speaker 4]
Can I... I'm going to do investigation to see if there's a trap, like if the pedestal itself is trapped.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, yeah, like invisible objects, maybe. As well, there are.

[Speaker 4]
Fifteen? This is just mundane traps, which is probably stupid, but, you know.

[Speaker 8]
Mind if I, uh...

[Speaker 2]
Uh, mind if I make an arcana check?

[Speaker 1]
Please do.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I will.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can. You can. Um, just leave the things inside.

Or, sorry, go ahead and leave your rolls inside here. When you're looking at these books, now that you're, like, approaching it and getting a closer look overall, you're able to see that there's, like, pretty clearly a kind of, um... There's, like, signatures on the left-hand side.

They all look like doctor's, like, chicken scratch. So they're not readable. They almost look a little bit hazy, which is what Randall increasingly gets.

He's able to obviously tell at this point that the book itself is magical and specifically has some kind of glamour or illusionary enchantment over it.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, as in, like, it makes it impossible to read properly?

[Speaker 1]
Impossible to read properly, yes. With the exception of the first line.

[Speaker 2]
Tell me what it is.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. It is solus, which is an arcane word for passage. It can also be used in the context of shared or, um, union.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Why would they... I mean, Randall kind of thinks to himself... Well, he'll say it out loud.

Uh, so, this book has already been, um, encrypted. Like, why would they trap a book that nobody would actually understand? I feel like it is free for the taking.

[Speaker 3]
People will steal anything.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I'm going to back up. You can touch the book. Okay!

This is gonna go all the way to the other side of the room.

[Speaker 5]
He may be stupid, he's not that stupid.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, no, I...

[Speaker 5]
Fuck it, I'll also touch the book.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I grab, I open my backpack, grab a rope, tie the rope around the book, and then go 50 feet away and then tell everyone to get away.

[Speaker 1]
No, that book doesn't go anywhere.

[Speaker 2]
Monk grabs the book. Oh, okay, got it.

[Speaker 3]
Monk touches the book.

[Speaker 6]
I'll be right there as well.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing happens when you touch the book.

[Speaker 3]
Look, it's fine! He tries to pick it up.

[Speaker 1]
So... That's not really good.

[Speaker 3]
What about the pedestal?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... You touch the pedestal?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Now that's trapped. Nothing happens.

[Speaker 3]
How heavy is it? Can I just pick up the pedestal and take the book with me?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 3]
Damn it.

[Speaker 5]
So...

[Speaker 3]
Can I try to read the book?

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Monk, is it heavy?

[Speaker 1]
You guys can attempt to continue reading the book at this point, but... No, Monk's done.

[Speaker 3]
Monk's moving on. He can't move the book. He can't do anything with it.

He's moving on.

[Speaker 2]
Unless somebody wants to spell magic, then you're not going to be able to read it.

[Speaker 3]
No, Monk's moving on to the next room.

[Speaker 6]
You know, I'm not sure. Uh... Wait, to spell magic, huh?

[Speaker 2]
Alright, sure, fuck it. I'm no wizard. I think this is useless.

I'm, uh... I'll be following Monk. I'm following Monk too.

[Speaker 6]
Eh. Nah. I'm getting this thing.

To spell magic, let's take this damn book.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, you can only dispel one aspect. Do you dispel the immovability, or the...

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Got it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, because if I can take it, then I can, like, remove other aspects later.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, go ahead and make me a intelligent saving throw.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 7]
I'm doing pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you are not cursed.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Thank god.

[Speaker 2]
He would've became immovable if he failed that.

[Speaker 6]
Probably. So, uh... Can I move the book?

No. I cannot? Nope.

Shame.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Maybe brute strength will solve this. Let's just go, let's just go.

[Speaker 6]
He has a third level, right? Yeah. Mhm.

Uh... For each... So, if it's not...

If the spell itself is not at third level, then I can...

[Speaker 1]
As a standard, yes. That's how it would work.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Then I would have to make an ability check using my spellcasting ability.

[Speaker 2]
With my arcana check, was it also magically immovable, or was it just naturally immovable?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you guys have... Wasted a lot of time, we know. ...been able to move it. Alright, and so, what's Monk doing right now?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going into whatever next area I can. I am following.

[Speaker 1]
So, there's a door that goes... Much like last time, there are only two exits from this particular room. One of which goes...

Or is indicated to go downwards, and one of which is indicated to go upwards.

[Speaker 4]
Probably go up, because that's where they were... That's where all the little magical...

[Speaker 2]
I thought we were here to... I thought we were here to slay a dragon.

[Speaker 4]
We are. The dragon's at the top of the tower.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Did we see that?

[Speaker 3]
Monk was in the process of licking his finger to do, like, the which way the wind is going test. And then he says, and he's like... Wind says up!

Go up!

[Speaker 2]
I feel like it's smarter for a dragon to stay in a slayer where it can protect its gold. Maybe this isn't slayer.

[Speaker 3]
You don't know this dragon's life.

[Speaker 5]
Why are we assuming what a dragon does and does not do?

[Speaker 3]
Don't judge a dragon's life.

[Speaker 5]
It's smart.

[Speaker 3]
Anyway, we go up.

[Speaker 5]
This dragon probably has more intelligence than me.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it definitely has more intelligence than me.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, up we go.

[Speaker 4]
Mmhmm. Monk will lead the charge. Charis behind, just in case we run into a trap.

Edmund right behind that. Monk would be doing the, like, leading by following Cerys.

[Speaker 3]
Like, looking back and going like, this way, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, that way.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
When... I was gonna attempt to remember it, because, yeah, I really don't like this. I don't like this layout.

Okay, so you guys, when you grab the handle for this thing, you start feeling like this freezing sensation creep up your arm.

[Speaker 8]
Mmhmm.

[Speaker 1]
Trying to make me a wisdom saver. No.

[Speaker 3]
We're dead. I'm dead. No, no, no.

I've got shit to keep me from being frightened or charmed. I'm not dead. The handle is locked.

[Speaker 1]
Unless the DC is 21. No, so you just take some cold damage.

[Speaker 3]
Roll a saving. Roll a wisdom saving throw.

[Speaker 5]
Is that only the person opening the door?

[Speaker 4]
I think everybody.

[Speaker 1]
It's the person opening the, no, just the person opening the door.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, that's me.

[Speaker 1]
It does not open, but you do not take... There we go. So you do not take...

[Speaker 7]
Or, sorry, you are not paralyzed.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 7]
I say we do this the old fashioned way. We just kick it down.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, go for it. Do it. Perfect.

Mom stands to the side.

[Speaker 2]
I stay away. Fuck, that hurt.

[Speaker 3]
Did it open?

[Speaker 7]
I'm sorry, does it?

[Speaker 4]
He just lodges his foot through it. It didn't open, but his foot's through it.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, somebody help me. All right, and go ahead and make me a wisdom save, Edmund.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's not a save. This would be a save. Ah, they're both the same.

Fifteen.

[Speaker 1]
Fifteen? Okay, you are paralyzed and stuck to the door. And your mom moves of its own accord.

A haunting, possessive voice says, The book demands a signature. At least one.

[Speaker 3]
For what?

[Speaker 1]
You're John Hancock, as a sacrifice.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, but what happens?

[Speaker 1]
Rez, you are yourself once more.

[Speaker 4]
What happened? Well, it's not like we can bring the book to you.

[Speaker 3]
No, someone's gotta go down and sign the book. Like a visitor. Visitor.

You were here. Do you know how to write your name?

[Speaker 6]
I acknowledge that's a bad idea, but I'm gonna go down and sign my name.

[Speaker 3]
No, let him do it. I want to be able to turn into a tree. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Rowan will do it.

[Speaker 3]
I don't care, it's a bad idea.

[Speaker 5]
The question was, how many people?

[Speaker 3]
Two so far.

[Speaker 5]
Well, my handwriting's not the best, but...

[Speaker 4]
Fuck it. Probably better than the scratches that were made in the book.

[Speaker 5]
Edmund's also gonna sign the book. He'll laugh if this condemns all three of us to die.

[Speaker 4]
I won't. We'll be leaving without the dragon dead.

[Speaker 2]
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but didn't it just say just one of us had to sign, and then all of us could go through as plus ones?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
I don't... I mean, I'm not signing that.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, out of character, that's what I did here. It demands one signature.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, just one. You can sign it too, just in case one of you guys dies, and then all of a sudden we'll trespass.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, who already said that they signed it? Rowan...

[Speaker 3]
I said he would sign it first, before anybody else.

[Speaker 1]
Who already said that they signed it? Edmund. Edmund, and then Rowan.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know why. And then... And then Shelton says what he says about, like, only one of us needs to sign it.

[Speaker 1]
This is my plastic toy ray gun. How many tickles does it take to get an octopus to laugh?

[Speaker 8]
Ten tickles!

[Speaker 1]
Hey, I'm gonna pull the trigger!

[Speaker 3]
Leave the door open for us.

[Speaker 8]
I guess Monk will just be ready to open the door.

[Speaker 6]
Watch this be an impromptu... Oh, by the way, so, would you like to subclass into Undying Warlock?

[Speaker 5]
Alright, now that it's signed, I think we go back up and try to open the door again. Edmund's gonna lead the way.

[Speaker 3]
Monk's at the door, he's opening it. Do we get through?

[Speaker 5]
Please?

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
You needed to sign with...

[Speaker 1]
Do you remember to sign? Because I think there's only... What?

[Speaker 2]
No, I was just going to say, do you want me to continue? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, so I think if it's only three... If it's not the party... First, Rapinius is gonna sign.

He feels as if... He feels as if he's...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, dare to sign?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
That's funny.

[Speaker 1]
So it's a D10. Okay, so we're gonna do this. That's gonna be Chris Rapinius, because I forgot to call it out in order.

Next is Rowan, then Monk, then Edmund.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if this is happening to you.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we're just signing away our souls, it's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe a little blood. I am done signing things. No thank you.

[Speaker 2]
What the fuck? For one of you that likes to get experimental...

[Speaker 1]
Rowan, you do not detect what it's going to be... The explicit effect that's happened to you. But you definitely forget that you signed the book to begin with.

Let's see here. Monk, you don't really cast spells. That's kind of funny.

And then... Another three. Funny.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-mm. I look at... Christopher Rapinius.

How are you doing? You good? What's going on?

[Speaker 1]
His eyes look like they have very slight cataracts over them.

[Speaker 3]
Gah! Uh-oh.

[Speaker 6]
So, given that Rowan doesn't remember the fact that he signed the book... Wouldn't that mean he would then try to sign the book again? Hey!

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 8]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he would.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You go over... You recognize... So here's the thing.

Once you sign the book, you do recognize Rowan's signature.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. Wait, how did that get there?

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, you guys are now free at last to progress to the top of the tower.

[Speaker 3]
Well, is he... Wait, he's blind?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, not blind. I just... Okay.

I think I just got something in my eye. I think that pen doesn't work so good. Got a little something in there.

[Speaker 3]
Your eyes don't work.

[Speaker 5]
Does Edmund feel anything?

[Speaker 1]
Edmund, much like Rowan, initially forgot that he put his signature down. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I... Can we say I know a random person's name?

[Speaker 4]
What? Can you sign a random person's name?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, can I just, like, think of, like, the person who, like...

[Speaker 8]
Not anymore.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 8]
Forgery?

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
You're doing forgery at a wizard's tower?

[Speaker 3]
I'm not gonna stop you from signing somebody's name.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, Monk is going to the top.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I just want to open the door.

[Speaker 1]
Charis, do you recall what the top of this tower is?

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Um... Uh...

No. It had some, like, potions in it or something?

[Speaker 1]
No, that was the fourth floor.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. But no.

[Speaker 1]
Is it in the session report?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, let me just check it really quickly. Um... See, I don't remember if we went to the top of the tower first, and then went down?

[Speaker 1]
You guys went to, um...

[Speaker 7]
You guys went to the fourth, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. The entrance to upstairs was blocked. I don't know what's...

[Speaker 8]
In any case, so, Monk is...

[Speaker 4]
Monk is doing his stuff. Indeed there was. He was doing his stuff.

[Speaker 1]
I want somebody to roll me. Uh, who is going to be the first one through the door?

[Speaker 3]
Monk is.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Monk, go ahead and roll me a d100.

[Speaker 3]
Sure.

[Speaker 4]
Do you really want Monk to die? You're just playing with his life. He's fine with it.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, Monk signed our name on it, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
And he thought it was funny. Probably giggled at the little hearts that he put at the end of his name. A little sunshine.

[Speaker 2]
I wish we knew the full name of the red dragon, and so that way we could just put his name on that. That'd be funny.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sorry, what was the d100 roll?

[Speaker 3]
It...

[Speaker 1]
It's 24.

[Speaker 3]
It should be there. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, sorry. That's okay. I was looking at something else.

I have two screens open right now.

[Speaker 3]
Gotcha.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, there is a wizard with a lightning rod stuck through his chest who is currently perusing a shelf of magical tomes. In the center of the room is another wizard sitting behind a desk who is bound by ethereal, like, just magical chains, right? Made out of arcane force.

[Speaker 4]
Do I recognize either?

[Speaker 1]
You do not recognize the wizard who has a lightning rod through his chest. You do, however, recognize the wizard who is sitting in the middle of the seat.

[Speaker 4]
I think I'm going to address the one in the middle of the room and be like, oh gods, what did you do to him?

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Ah, yes. I don't recall really inviting any of you in here, but I too was an uninvited guest, and you know...

[Speaker 3]
I've heard people tell me that before.

[Speaker 1]
That's a little concerning. Anyways, I required use of his tower, and the dragon around here required use of a mage, so I took the tower over.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, there's a dragon. Indeed. Does he have a name?

[Speaker 1]
Normally I'd be happy to announce myself, but I can tell you're not a mortal.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not? Oh.

[Speaker 1]
You are the Fair Folk, obviously.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, but I'm still... I can still die.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, we're going to be testing that theory soon, based on your current actions.

[Speaker 4]
You can die too, and there's more of us than there are of you. It's funny you should mention that.

[Speaker 1]
This little device right here makes that rather difficult. And don't get me wrong, I don't like the circumstances under which I've been forced to endure it, but they've given me something of a long, long... we'll say the long view of how I might get out of this situation.

[Speaker 4]
We wouldn't happen to be able to help you, would we? We don't have to fight, but we will.

[Speaker 1]
This nice little thing in the center of my chest kind of binds me to the dragon itself. I don't like the dragon, but this was its insurance policy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so if it dies, you die.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct, but as long as it lives, well, there's a multitude of ways back to death.

[Speaker 6]
So, if for whatever reason I were to have a diamond on hand to revivify you quickly after...

[Speaker 1]
I do kind of like the sound of that. I do believe you'll be left alive as a contingency. Like, Rowan just pulls out the gem worth 500 GP.

That's the kind of compliance I like. Actually, I think I'm warming up to you people slightly. Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

The wizard in the chair is just...

[Speaker 4]
Arrgh! Charis looks away, she doesn't want to see it. She will look away!

Why is he here?

[Speaker 2]
Why is she supposed to look at me, Hector?

[Speaker 4]
Great conversation.

[Speaker 6]
I do believe he is not currently a matter of importance.

[Speaker 3]
Why would you say that when he's right here? That's rude.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I imagine this fellow here probably has kept him in there for a reason. Yes, I was stealing the tower. My options were basically...

My options were to get killed by the dragon or present some use to him. In a fit of panic, I told him it was my tower.

[Speaker 6]
To make it so...

[Speaker 1]
Please, I can really only stand my own vagary and lack of specificity when it comes to speech.

[Speaker 4]
If we revive you...

[Speaker 1]
We can't both have a flair for the dramatic. It's not going to work.

[Speaker 4]
Will you help us fight the dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Fight the dragon? No, I think that if you were to... If you were to kill the dragon and then revive me, I would have no reason to curse you in death.

[Speaker 4]
Good enough.

[Speaker 1]
I turned out to be way more reasonable than I was even hoping. I mean, all of you look... Okay, here's something I can offer.

You people... Not to be too insulting, but you all look like shit.

[Speaker 3]
Monk coughs in just a puff of dirt.

[Speaker 8]
A puff of dirt.

[Speaker 1]
I would definitely mind getting reincarnated.

[Speaker 3]
I know someone who can do it whenever. I changed my mind.

[Speaker 1]
The reincarnation would work perfectly. I reserved the right to my earlier... I do reserve the right to my threat.

I will say promise to curse anybody who ends up resulting in my death. Or ends up provoking my death.

[Speaker 6]
Or naturally keeping you that way.

[Speaker 3]
That's, you know, got to go for mad options, you know? Wait, so now you don't want us to kill the dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I didn't say that. I was just noting that, you know, if you do kill the dragon and I die, then your options are to revive me as I was, or to get cursed.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, alright.

[Speaker 1]
I could offer you a safe place to rest for the evening.

[Speaker 2]
Are you the only one who needs a resurrection after we slay this beast?

[Speaker 1]
I'm not sure of the question behind the question there.

[Speaker 2]
If we resurrect you, will we still be cursed by other wizards? Other dead wizards?

[Speaker 8]
Other dead wizards? I don't know what you care about.

[Speaker 1]
Any other wizards? Frankly, I haven't really inquired as to their personal relationships. That's a lie.

I actually have. I just couldn't figure out anything about them. Aside from the fact that he might be alive in some drow houses, but that's really not a lot to go off of, so...

[Speaker 4]
Does he have any weaknesses? This dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Probably reacts poorly to getting killed. No, so the... Okay, if there's any weakness that it does have, it's pride.

The wizard will respond to really any challenge. It's a vain creature, but other than that, it's going to stalk you and hunt you quite far down to the ends of the earth, and...

[Speaker 7]
I can't really comprehend that. Cool pride, you say? Well then, let's go mock a dragon!

[Speaker 1]
Are you doing that now? Preferably when we've seen it.

[Speaker 3]
I think you meant, are we taking a rest here? Or are we going to skip the long rest?

[Speaker 5]
We're going to skip the rest. We don't need a rest.

[Speaker 3]
What about spellcasters?

[Speaker 4]
What are your spells? Um, I have only expended one spell, so I think I'm good.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I've expended all my third level slots.

[Speaker 3]
So do you want to take a rest and get them back?

[Speaker 6]
Hmm. May as well take advantage of the opportunity.

[Speaker 5]
Probably be a little time sensitive.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I would personally like to get back to, um, where I was.

[Speaker 1]
The excavation. Where were you, by the way?

[Speaker 4]
That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He, like, hot water and molten dirt goes at the wizard. Cold, wet, and dark to the safety and comfort of a, quite frankly, a lusciously well-stocked tower. Have you seen, he has prostitutes in the third floor, but more important is the kitchen.

[Speaker 4]
Charis, like, kind of scowls just a little bit, like, eh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Why would Fairfolk be upset with that? Mmm.

[Speaker 4]
Not her thing.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, okay, no, that's fair. Because my character's also fae, but he just does not give a shit. So, kitchen, you say?

Indeed, indeed, but yes, you all probably, I mean, if you're going to fight the dragon, you probably should rest.

[Speaker 5]
We have places to get back to.

[Speaker 1]
Like what, for instance?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I... There's no harm in telling you. I have nowhere to be.

[Speaker 5]
There's, we're sort of in this, uh, situation. Big portal, big scary creatures, yes. And Edmund says in the most, like, cryptic, stupid way possible.

[Speaker 1]
I was already aware of that. Um, the, let's see here. Oh, you just...

Somebody literate is going to have to explain this one to me.

[Speaker 4]
The, uh, the, the...

[Speaker 1]
Portal network, there's armies going to invade through, we don't want that to happen. I've, I've, listen, we've already gone over that need for only one person engaged in dramatic vagary, and that's going to have to be me, because... Really, this isn't my story, this is your story.

And, gosh, I really don't want to have to...

[Speaker 4]
It's a Yggdrasil, right?

[Speaker 1]
...ask you about it. A Ysregan, I assume. Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Never going to get that right. Do you know anything of it?

[Speaker 1]
I know it's a portal network. I know that the prime gate is quite close nearby. And I know that there's a means of opening it, where you actually spill the blood of a fae.

And they plant, and then a... Some other powerful creature, normally, it can be a mortal sacrifice. The druids were quite fond of that at the time.

[Speaker 4]
Charis kind of just gets lost on the words, um, spill the blood of a fae. Here's none of the rest.

[Speaker 8]
Rowan, on the other hand, smiles.

[Speaker 4]
Hi! Um, do you spill the blood of a fae, well, inside? Or is that an outside of it thing?

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, that's an inside thing. There's a way to activate the gate from the outside, but I'm not aware. It's something to do with the gate's construction itself.

And if it's been modified, I don't know of any way to store it. I assume that's the... I assume that's the case.

I don't know how to restore its original shape. I only know how to... I only know how to basically activate...

I only know how to basically kickstart it. You know, like an engine.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Probably going to be turned on at some point.

[Speaker 1]
But yes, is there anything interesting going on over there? What's the big rush to get it open? I'm not really able to travel far at the moment, so I'm certainly...

[Speaker 5]
Let's say there's some very impatient individuals.

[Speaker 1]
Let's say something specific in nature, and... which allows and gives me some context for the situation at hand, and allows me to respond in a similarly specific and informative fashion.

[Speaker 6]
Some centaurs, a corporation, and a bunch of...

[Speaker 5]
And a whole bunch of fae are fighting over it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
So there's an army of centaurs.

[Speaker 1]
There's an army of centaurs. We've made some progress here. Actually, you know what?

I don't care if you know anything anymore. That's fine. That's fine.

I'm going down to the third floor. You've stressed me out.

[Speaker 4]
I suppose we'll follow.

[Speaker 2]
Which floor had the prostitutes, and which floor had the kitchen?

[Speaker 1]
Wouldn't you like to know?

[Speaker 2]
And which floor had the kitchen?

[Speaker 1]
The second floor will have the kitchen and your lodgings. I won't bore you with the details, but I can switch the orientation of this tower around. It seems as though the curse that keeps this poor wizard from controlling his own death and controlling his own tower is localized entirely to him.

Can you believe it?

[Speaker 6]
I find it hysterical. Fascinating mechanism, to be sure.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if it is replicated. Alright, so you guys are fed. Do not take a long rest.

What do you guys do?

[Speaker 4]
Kill that fucking dragon.

[Speaker 5]
Kill the fucking dragon.

[Speaker 1]
No, like, what do you do? You're in a wizard tower. Are you doing anything inside the wizard tower?

[Speaker 3]
I did want Monk to go through the books in the library. Right? It was a library?

[Speaker 1]
It's a shelf full of magical tomes inside the wizard's study. I will also go do that.

[Speaker 3]
I was going to have Monk grab a random tome and give it to Christopher Phineas to smuggle out.

[Speaker 1]
Sir, I think that's... Now, call me crazy, but do you see any kind of defenses over this? I mean, this bookshelf isn't locked or anything.

[Speaker 3]
You want me to steal something else?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, it's just the guy here is blinking... He's blinking a seven-letter word at me, the wizard in the desk.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, blinking! Blinking? Blinking?

There's a wizard with a thing through him. Yeah, okay, okay, let's go.

[Speaker 1]
He's chained to this. That's the wizard you guys were talking to. This is the guy that was, um...

This is the guy that Charis knew initially and who ended up, uh, is currently chained.

[Speaker 3]
Seven-letter word, hmm. Monk will go like, oh yeah, that guy. He'll go over and be like, alright.

How do we get you out?

[Speaker 1]
He just shakes his head.

[Speaker 4]
I got a gun. No? You can't be let out, or you don't want to?

Wait, um... Are you there? You don't want to come out.

[Speaker 1]
He keeps, like, shaking his head over the other way towards the observatory.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry, what is he doing?

[Speaker 1]
He's, like, shaking his head away from the bookshelf and shaking his head towards the observatory.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Oh, you want me to, okay, monk will go that way. Hold on, is there danger in there?

I don't know, but he's going.

[Speaker 4]
He takes, okay, make an insight check.

[Speaker 1]
He takes, like, three seconds before he shakes his head no.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, insight. Sixteen.

[Speaker 1]
Gosh, it was a really long time. There was definitely some thought behind that, uh, that head shake there. Some thought and intention behind it.

[Speaker 4]
So there is danger, got it. Monk trusts him 100%, he's going. Monk, careful, there's likely danger in there.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, monk, you can see that through this, looking through this observatory, that it's pointed towards the eye of the storm, and in this eye of the storm, let's see here, you can see that basically this telescope is, like, channeling power into the center of it, as also, technically speaking, receiving power. That's all your untrained, non-wizard eyes would be able to glean at the moment.

[Speaker 3]
He'll point at it and look at the guy, like, do you want me to move this?

[Speaker 1]
He, um, he's, he's, like, goes, nods yes at first, and then shakes his head, and then kind of, like, looks over, like, really indecisively.

[Speaker 4]
How, how does this guy feel? I don't know. I'm a fairy, I can, I can feel emotions, how does he feel?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the glamour of the rich, dense, and quite frankly decadent glamour of panic has, is just flowing off this man. Like a chocolate fountain.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna get really close. Why are you panicked? I'm like, about to move something.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sorry, what did you say?

[Speaker 3]
Um, I, um.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I meant Nessie.

[Speaker 3]
I said because Monk's about to move the telescope thingy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I thought you said something completely different.

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, uh.

[Speaker 3]
I was joking, but it's just Monk in general that's making him panic.

[Speaker 1]
I believe it. Yeah, so he's not really able to respond in this state. Is the entire party just still inside it?

No, I went to the kitchen.

[Speaker 3]
It's Monk, Cirrus, Charis, excuse me, and Christopher Pineus. That's, that's who's here.

[Speaker 6]
Rowan will go looking around for visible objects using his sickle.

[Speaker 1]
Since that's one of the properties. Okay. You find a chest.

You actually find a chest inside this very room. Interesting. There is specifically magic coming off of this one.

There is abjuration.

[Speaker 8]
Huh.

[Speaker 6]
I recognize that it's probably a bad idea. But.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna open it. It's just an arcing lockspell.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so I'm just gonna go grab someone who can actually unlock it then. So, uh, does anybody have some way of dealing with that?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I don't.

[Speaker 1]
Christopher Pineus says, uh, boss, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna run down to the kitchen, or third floor and see if I can distract the mage. Uh, he seems, listen, he seems like really, really overconfident and haughty. Like, what's, what's your read on this guy?

He just, he just left us up here with his prisoner. Knowing that we had history, these guys have history with him for some reason. Yeah, that's probably a bad thing.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't know if we should let this guy out. Well, no.

[Speaker 6]
At the same time, um, I don't think, um, I don't think he's meaning that. I think he means that we are, we should very much not trust the guy that's currently downstairs. Well, upstairs, rather.

[Speaker 3]
Obviously, you walk in, he's a giganto douche nerd. Not a good combination.

[Speaker 6]
Also, instead of just grabbing stuff, I'm just gonna go use Dispel Magic, fourth level, on the invisible chest, specifically on the arcane lock effect. It works! Alright, what do I find inside?

[Speaker 1]
There's a wizard spellbook, there are five unidentified scrolls. And there are three unidentified potions, in addition to two greater healing potions.

[Speaker 8]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Damn. So five scrolls, a spellbook, and finally there is a bomb. With a little lightning symbol.

Does it look, does it look like it's about to go off?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hell yeah, that one's mine!

[Speaker 1]
What's up? Does it look like it's about to go off? Uh, yes.

Sorry, no, no, it does not look like it's about to go off, it's just a bomb.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. It's Monk's, he grabs it. He's like, oh, okay!

He runs over from the telescope.

[Speaker 6]
I will grab, I will grab the spellbook and the spell scrolls.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'm gonna go move the telescope now. Are there any illusion scrolls in that little hoard there?

[Speaker 1]
Somebody needs to identify them in order to detect this little tidbit. Factoid. In the meantime, Randall, tell me what you're up to right now.

[Speaker 2]
So I waddle my way down to the kitchen to grab myself a snack. I also kind of want to know, as I said, wizards be very eccentric. There's probably some hidden, there's probably, the refrigerator's probably a hidden doorway to somewhere or someway.

But that's just a hunch. I'm gonna go to the kitchen and do two things. One, get food.

And two, make an investigation check. Which I'm not good at, but it seems very helpful to do that.

[Speaker 1]
So you get down to the kitchen, there is a metal box that's outlined in white marble. And has a frosty element coming from it. And contains some relatively, or contains some very well preserved and chilled food.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I don't know. Can you describe to me the foods? Or are they just like normal, it's not like magic.

Okay, just food. Uh, yeah, I just grabbed three foods. You never know when you're going to like end up.

[Speaker 1]
There's like, there's fruits, there's um, well, there's some meat that's still taking time to cure. And there are 17 punchbowl sized margaritas. What?

There are several fruits, several meats in the process of curing. And 17 punchbowl sized margaritas.

[Speaker 2]
I take, I don't know how heavy that'll be. I'll take one margarita, and like a punchbowl margarita. I'll just take that and, am I able to store that?

Or is it like, not wrapped? I, um, it's not wrapped, no. Okay, I can't store that then.

[Speaker 3]
Can you hear a whisper on the wind that you need to bring one to Monk?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, sure. Woo! Uh, I'll, I'll grab a margarita bowl, put that on like the kitchen island if that exists somewhere.

Uh, or on the floor if it doesn't. Uh, I'll grab two fruits. Uh, one, just two like, uh, what are they called?

Just, uh, well, uh, grapes. Grapes, uh, on a vine. Uh, and then, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make an investigation check on the kitchen, but I will let you know I'm starting off by...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, alright, so go ahead and get ready to type in chat basically what your goal is here when you're doing that. Uh, and go ahead and take a point of inspiration, that was fun.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, okay, uh...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so like I said, go ahead and type it in chat, I'm gonna switch over to the other folks for a moment here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, got it, thank you. Okay, what are you guys doing at this point?

[Speaker 3]
Monk's moving the telescope.

[Speaker 5]
Everyone wants to talk to the wizard.

[Speaker 6]
Rowan will, uh, try to identify the, uh, the spell scrolls, what spells are in the spell book. Yeah, do you identify a spell? Oh, no, like, uh, no, arcana.

[Speaker 1]
Can I make an arcana check?

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 1]
But you can make an arcana check, uh, I don't know exactly what information you're going to glean from that besides... Let's see here, you can make an arcana check to attempt to cast a spell.

[Speaker 6]
No, uh, no, I'm just like trying to figure out, like, okay, like, what the hell are these specifically?

[Speaker 1]
So that way I can help someone. Yeah, that's what the identify spell is for.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, didn't mean to do that.

[Speaker 6]
I'll probably just end up giving these to my wizard character later. No, that's not how that works.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so never mind, just sell it on the open market. Yeah, you know, just, well, no, it depends on, like, whether or not you're, somebody in your party wants that stuff. That is true.

Or tries to, like, claim to it. Um... That is true.

Does anybody want it? That gets decided at the end of the session. Or, well, somebody could take some of it now, obviously.

[Speaker 4]
There's scrolls?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's five unidentified scrolls, a wizard's spellbook, and then there's, uh, I believe we said three potions, two greater healing potions, and one bomb.

[Speaker 4]
I'll take the scrolls. I'm kind of...

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I'll take a greater healing potion.

[Speaker 6]
I'll keep the spellbook, then.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, how many potions are there?

[Speaker 1]
Three unidentified, two greater healing.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take the other greater healing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, at this point, Edmund, you are down talking to the wizard, as is Christopher Pinius, and is there anybody else?

[Speaker 3]
Nope.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, the wizard is getting, like, he's putting on a bathrobe, uh, and enjoying a nice cigarette. He's kind of sitting in a, he's like, oh, I'm just about to head into the sauna. Did you want...

Did you want anything? Did you need anything?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yes, we can talk while you're in the sauna, and Edmund's gonna...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. Uh, I hope you're not coming in fully dressed.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, no. Is there a towel around here?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, there's a changing room.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Edmund's gonna get changed.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. Uh, this guy... He has a spell for taking clothes off instantly, and one for putting them back on instantly.

I only learned the one for putting them back on instantly. I assume the other one is cursed.

[Speaker 4]
Where does one learn this spell?

[Speaker 1]
It's in a spellbook that's in your possession right now.

[Speaker 4]
Ah! Hell yeah. Removal of clothes spell.

That's a fun spell. To shock your enemies.

[Speaker 1]
Basically, elves are, if you're immune to magical sleep, you're immune to it, because it just works off the dream logic of, uh, having a nightmare where you're naked. Or not even a nightmare, just a dream where you're naked for some reason, and like, at school. Or at...

What was the other one? Oh, never mind. Anyways.

Does it work on armor? You're not there. But...

Sorry. Yeah, so, uh, what did you want to know?

[Speaker 5]
Two things. First, and most importantly, the dragon.

[Speaker 8]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Do you know where it is? Oh, it's gonna be in the center of the... probably in the Eye of the Storm there.

It's a donut shape. It's a donut shape. There's a...

technically speaking, there's like three layers to it before you even get to the Eye of the Storm. There's the first wind wall. Pretty difficult to get through.

The resistance isn't so bad. It's all of the, um... It's the chance of just having your...

It's the chance of just having your projectiles, magical or otherwise, blown off course. Then, of course, there's the... Sorry.

Then, of course, there's kind of like the inner... The inner layer, the second layer of the donut. This is the one where you could get blown about like a ragdoll if you're not careful.

And then the final layer before the Eye of the Storm is where you'll just get... Lifted up and deposited in some direction inside the Eye of the Storm itself. But it might not be together.

And it's... you're going to probably lose your sense of direction while you're there. There's enough lightning in there and electromagnetic fields to throw off any compass you might have either.

It's very frustrating.

[Speaker 5]
Very useful information.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Is there a way to get through this wall safely?

[Speaker 1]
No. That's why it's there. Teleportation, perhaps.

[Speaker 8]
Could you?

[Speaker 1]
As I think on it, probably teleportation. That's the method I used.

[Speaker 5]
You used, so... Could you do the same to us?

[Speaker 1]
Teleport you somewhere? Yes. So that means if I teleport you somewhere, I'm then put in that location.

Though I could... you know, there would be a way around it. I would just require some assets in return.

Go on. That would be expensive. I mean, it's you who should be going out at this point.

[Speaker 5]
Well, what assets do you require?

[Speaker 1]
What is this? Like, what's your budget? What's your price and what's your budget?

I'm not some... Please. I'm a luxury guy.

I'm better than this.

[Speaker 5]
Admin needs a moment to think.

[Speaker 1]
I think he needs two moments.

[Speaker 8]
True.

[Speaker 1]
Christopher Penny is, in the meantime, just taking the opportunity to schmooze as much as possible. He's like, my my, it must have been a real bitch of a time getting a tower like this. And predictably, the wizard's like, oh, no, actually, it was, you know, it was perfectly fine.

I didn't have much of a struggle at all. Now, I have to be modest here. The wizard was, you know, the original owner was pretty preoccupied, you know, coming back from the dead, pretty much.

I think it's more of like a time reversal thing, but he didn't really fill me in on the details. Just overall, all in all, a pretty selfish person. I'm quite frankly kind of happy that I took this tower from him.

Knowledge is meant to be shared with other knowledgeable people who can take advantage of it. So I felt like that was, I qualified. And certainly I had the means and method to threaten him into helping me otherwise.

So I didn't know why he was so stingy with this whole eternal weird, eternal life thing he has going on. So he and Christopher Penny are just going back and forth and back and forth.

[Speaker 5]
I've got it. You're a wizard. You probably don't care much for materials.

Yes, you are a wizard. You probably don't care much for the material things like me. How about knowledge, magic?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you poor thing, you are uneducated. No, I do, I do value magic as well. Yes, of course.

Well, the magic I use... The bobble, the magical locket that your mother gave you when you were a babe. A family heirloom passed down to Wardoff.

An ancient curse.

[Speaker 5]
Here, you can study it. No taking.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you actually had one. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be culturally insensitive. I hope that wasn't...

An Edmundsgate invisibly pissed off. Are rhinestone... Is rhinestone jewelry important to your culture?

[Speaker 5]
I have no clue what that is.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so what have you tossed to the wizard at this point?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so I'm basically showing him the runes and carved into my weapon and seeing if he can make sense of it. Maybe he will learn something from it. That he could...

He might find value.

[Speaker 1]
Like handing him an amulet.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no, I was showing him my weapon and the runes and carved onto it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's giant magic, that is interesting. It's actually what I originally came to the Valley to study. Giant runes are not as common in this part of the world, unfortunately.

But there's still a few cloud giants. The Cloud King, as they're called in the Cloud Forest. I originally wanted to travel there, but I saw a tower teleport down from the sky, land, unharmed, mostly unharmed, here, if you can believe it.

I just had to investigate, and that's my current predicament. I find my heartbeats a little easier when this electric rod is moist.

[Speaker 8]
Gross.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so you came here to study giant magic. I might be able to help you with it. I'm quite versed in it.

[Speaker 1]
He says, I had to throw you a bone. He pulls out... Let's see here.

Sorry, he doesn't pull out. He has a necklace around him, and it's a tiny little orb. When he grabs onto it, he's like, I need this.

Then he casts the Identify spell, and obviously reads the magic.

[Speaker 5]
He cast it on the amulet.

[Speaker 7]
What amulet?

[Speaker 1]
You said there's no amulet.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you said he cast it on an amulet or something, so I was confused.

[Speaker 1]
No, he said he cast it from an amulet.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's a spell casting progress. Oh. That's what Christopher Penny assists you with.

To help clear things up.

[Speaker 5]
So he identifies the weapons next.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that's a very interesting weapon, I suppose. Definitely interested in the stones and domes thing. But actually, if I ever do get out of this predicament...

And I'm not saying I necessarily even want to... Certainly some future-proofing against... Certainly some future-proofing against life-threatening injuries slash curses like these.

I wasn't aware that this was even possible until I was blessed with the meeting of a particularly creative Bloom Dragon.

[Speaker 7]
That's so annoying. Well...

[Speaker 5]
Tell you what, I'm gonna kill this dragon.

[Speaker 1]
Don't think that you're going to. I think I'm reasonably confident that you're going to fail. But you all sure are.

Listen, the best thing is to get a good night's sleep.

[Speaker 4]
I don't trust that at all.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and let's see here. I want you and Christopher Phineas to make me Wisdom Saving Throws.

[Speaker 7]
No! Not my boy!

[Speaker 1]
Dammit. He has your proficiency bonus, Monk. And a plus four.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Four plus your proficiency bonus.

[Speaker 3]
What am I making? Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
A Wisdom Saving Throw.

[Speaker 3]
Wisdom, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Like I said, it's just four plus your proficiency bonus.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
What did you get?

[Speaker 3]
A 24.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Okay, you are free to control. I'll let you know what Christopher's plan is at this point.

He's planning to play along with the suggestion.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And basically take Edmund to relatively safe quarters until he's able to get word to you specifically.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Edmund goes to sleeping quarters, which are about one floor down. As mentioned, the kitchen. You guys actually pass.

You guys pass Ralph. No, not Ralph. Randall.

[Speaker 2]
Don't you dare call me Ralph!

[Speaker 3]
Randall!

[Speaker 2]
No, you can call me Ralph if you really want.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like that's just a thing now.

[Speaker 2]
You see me just messing around in the kitchen. I don't know if the spotlight has moved towards me again or not.

[Speaker 1]
It's literally passing you, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Can I make an investigation? I was just going to... Can I make an investigation check and then the Arcana check that I mentioned?

[Speaker 1]
Where are the characters at? First, move the fridge. Second, look in cabinets.

Third... Yes!

[Speaker 2]
Okay. The investigation is all that crap. Just getting specifics down for you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, I saw that. Go ahead and make the roll.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Look here. Investigation first.

I'm probably going to roll very bad on that. I already know it. What did I roll?

A 13. And then I'll just make it now. You can tell me about it later.

I'll do the Arcana check on the punchbowl.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay, so there's nothing special about the punchbowl. You do, on the other hand, notice a... You do end up finding a lever that moves the refrigerator to the side.

Right as Christopher Penias and Edmund are walking through the kitchen and out to go to the bedrooms.

[Speaker 3]
Can I move Edmund into the... Can I just shove him into the walkway behind the fridge?

[Speaker 1]
Edmund is currently under the effects of a Suggestion spell, so he's still making his way over.

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Is this like a walkway I can just walk into?

[Speaker 3]
I guess. Yeah, I'm trying to decide if I want to just give a message and continue on or stop. I guess he'll say, Oh, hi, hey, wizard's bad!

Put us under a spell! Please go tell the others. And like, Blue dragon!

The storm is around the dragon! Really, really bad! We can't get to it!

Would be cool if you could do that now! Okay, thank you, bye! And then he'll follow Edmund to keep him company, I guess.

[Speaker 2]
Did you specify which was? Well, I can probably grab it from context clues. Okay.

I'm going to assume that's the whistle that is not chained up.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, Edmund is already out of the room.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Pineus will follow him just in case, I don't know, just to keep him safe or something.

[Speaker 1]
Especially since he's a very good friend.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Am I alone in the kitchen again?

[Speaker 1]
I suppose so.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, what does... You said the fridge moved to the side, what's that?

[Speaker 1]
There's a passage that goes straight behind it about, we'll say, 20 feet to start.

[Speaker 2]
And then I don't know what's beyond it, because it makes like a turn?

[Speaker 7]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god. I mean, I... I'm going to be a real...

I'm sorry, I just met you. I feel like I need a bit more... I feel like I need more than that to just know something.

This immediately gives me the vibe of... Maybe somebody saw in here, so I'm actually going to go in the fridge first. Basically to like...

Get my hunch, like, correct. To see if I see anything bad in there.

[Speaker 1]
Anything bad inside the fridge, or do you mean the passage beyond the fridge?

[Speaker 2]
Passage be... I'm not going inside the fridge. Passage behind the fridge.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright. So, when you do that...

Oh god. Go further in, and there's a... There's a small corner to the right...

That has the, um... That has an identical looking fridge right next to it.

[Speaker 2]
I... I... Is this...

Hm. Okay, I'm going to open the fridge first.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, you see an icy tundra stretching out beyond you. That looks beautiful. Think of the perfect picturesque pine forest.

Um, sculpted like somebody had taken that hair curler to all of the branches. In just the right shapes. French girls...

Applant nature. Frozen in place. Every dewdrop a unique rainbow...

Greeting your eyes. Um, as a ranger... You would have the opportunity to make me an arcana or history check.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Sure, what am I better with? I...

Oh, I'm good with both. Uh, let's just switch things up and do history. Uh, 14.

[Speaker 8]
14?

[Speaker 1]
You recognize another plane of existence when you see something that's definitely not from here. Uh, and it's probably something that's attached to the... It's probably something that's not like an outer plane or a transient plane.

It's probably not a place between worlds. It's probably something that's kind of, you know, a reflection of this one. But as for which one, there's a few different...

[Speaker 2]
It's... If it's a reflection of this one.

[Speaker 1]
Uh... But, this is the point at which we're going to move on to the people back at the top of the tower. Hello, people at the top of the tower.

[Speaker 8]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, hey, hey! Munchus Mill, the observatory, and the storm outside did not disperse, to be perfectly clear. But did disperse from the eye of the storm.

Its position changed. So, instead of this cyclone that was wrapped around this hole in the underdark, at first, it is now instead a proper cloud above the... A proper cloud above the cyclone itself.

Or, sorry, a proper cloud above the hole to the world below itself. There we go. Not around to it, actually.

[Speaker 3]
After Munch moved the telescope?

[Speaker 1]
After Munch moved the telescope.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, it's just like a normal storm. Well, not a normal storm, but certainly a, uh... I got a seven.

You got a seven.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Munch, you just really can't help yourself when it comes to looking, and so you're unable to avoid the direct, prolonged eye contact of the dragon's gaze.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no! Is this charmed or frightened? Because I do have stuff that helps with that.

[Speaker 1]
I think it would be appropriate to make a save versus frightened here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, because my minstrel dice also help with that. And something with Munch keeps me... Oh, no, that's, like, at the end of my turn.

I can... Stillness of Mind. It lets me end one effect on myself.

Okay, so... Where's my minstrel dice? Okay.

What am I making?

[Speaker 1]
A wisdom save.

[Speaker 3]
A wisdom save. Okay. Can I add my minstrel dice to it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you fail.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, if I fail. Okay. I got a 22.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, you're good. You're fine. You're better than good.

[Speaker 3]
He goes, Hello, guys! I'm seeing an eyeball! And he'll describe the eyeball he's seeing with his eyes.

[Speaker 1]
He immediately flies off towards the tower. You guys have ten minutes until the wizard... Until the lizard gets here.

Not the wizard.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I moved the storm. Now there's a cloud of wool. I think the dragon's...

Yeah, dragon's staring at me. Oh, here it comes. The dragon sees you?

[Speaker 4]
Hey, hey, dragon's coming. Dragon's... Yeah, his eyes are beautiful.

It's blue.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, the admin's obviously asleep during all this.

[Speaker 4]
The wizard that has the... He's trapped, or whatever he's doing. How does he seem now that the dragon is looking at us?

[Speaker 1]
His reaction to this information is... Thousand yards stare.

[Speaker 4]
Rose disassociated. He doesn't care anymore. He's like, he's accepted death.

Well, it's a happy die. Alright, I'm going to...

[Speaker 3]
Do y'all have sending? Does anybody have sending? Can we tell the other people?

In the tower? Our friend? Pippinius, for example?

[Speaker 4]
This tower can't be big enough that it would take ten minutes to get everybody...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, it's probably gonna take like two minutes. So currently...

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna fly around doing that.

[Speaker 1]
Admin, I need you to make me some athletics checks at disadvantage.

[Speaker 4]
How many?

[Speaker 1]
What was the first result? Fifteen.

[Speaker 3]
Fifteen.

[Speaker 1]
Fifteen? Do it again. Eleven.

Eleven. Okay, you take fifteen damage, then eleven damage. You are currently being gnawed upon by a mimic that was disguising itself as your dad.

[Speaker 3]
I forgot about the gnaw.

[Speaker 5]
Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 3]
Everyone forgets about the mimics. Christopher's starting to whack it with whatever he can.

[Speaker 1]
He's got a loot.

[Speaker 3]
Cheer, a loot. He's just like, well, hopefully Monk will buy me a new one.

[Speaker 1]
How quickly is the dragon approaching? Have you given Christopher Pippinius any kind of items? And when I said...

Well, earlier I told you you have ten minutes... Until he gets here, which is now six minutes.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if I... I mean, probably not. Monk didn't really want anything to do with him for the longest time, so I...

[Speaker 1]
For the longest time.

[Speaker 3]
Whatever Pippinius would have gotten himself.

[Speaker 6]
Rowan will try to get to a position so that as soon as the dragon gets within three hundred feet, cast Earthbind. Just ready action and wait.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good move.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. The, uh... Oh, fuck.

Um, where is our... Our wizard that we have... Quotations, you know.

[Speaker 3]
Third floor.

[Speaker 4]
Allied? Okay. I'll go to them and be like, hey, dragon, here.

And then move on.

[Speaker 1]
Interesting.

[Speaker 4]
And then I will get to the room where someone's being fucking eaten by a... Mimic and begin... Trying to stop them.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, have Christopher make me two weapon attacks a year.

[Speaker 5]
Please, for the love of God.

[Speaker 1]
Four plus your proficiency bonus, which I think monk's is four.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Or admin. Admin, you're taking this like a champ, by the way.

[Speaker 3]
Where is... Okay. So just a d20 plus...

[Speaker 1]
d20 plus... So four.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, plus eight.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Twenty-three.

[Speaker 1]
Twenty-three?

[Speaker 3]
I forget you can't see it.

[Speaker 1]
No, that'll be fine. That will work. It depends on which screen.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It will work. So Christopher Pinius unfortunately loses his loot.

But, and like, basically he breaks it off at the... He breaks the loot off. Or sorry, is the loot?

No, no, no. It's... I don't think it's a loot.

[Speaker 3]
The loot is like a guitar or... Oh, it is.

[Speaker 1]
It is like a guitar. Okay, so basically he breaks it off at like the stem or the bridge, whatever it's called. And then he uses that as like a...

It's like a... A bottle of broken glass is how he starts treating it.

[Speaker 4]
Just starts shanking the fuck out of it. Oh my God. Hell yeah.

I'm gonna toss him my drum and tell him... You know what? I'll do that afterwards.

Oh, fuck. Can I cast a... You know what?

I'm gonna stab this fucking mimic. Mm-hmm. Fuck this mimic.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's dead at this point. It doesn't have...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's dead? Okay. You come in as he's killed it.

All right. And then I'm gonna toss him a drum and be like, Here, use this not for hitting.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I wasn't really expecting this, but absolutely. Now that I think about it.

[Speaker 4]
He's a bard, right?

[Speaker 1]
He's an entertainer. So he's a bard in training. Or really, a minstrel in training.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so he needs help. Bless his heart. Okay.

I'll show him how to use it after we don't die.

[Speaker 5]
I'm assuming the suggestion spell has weared off. Well, it hasn't weared off. I've just completed...

It does wear you out. Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, that's what it means, basically. Meanwhile, I'm just waiting for the dragon to get in range.

[Speaker 4]
Um, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Did someone say dragon?

[Speaker 4]
Yes. The dragon is here. It's coming.

It's on the way.

[Speaker 6]
As soon as it gets in range, I have an action ready to cast Earthbind. I'm just waiting.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm gonna get a spell.

[Speaker 3]
What floor do we want to be on? That's a great question.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Can I appeal with a punchbowl with some, uh... Otherworldly...

Otherplanar ice in it?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. I appeal on whatever floor.

[Speaker 1]
And not combat energy. Like, hey, guys.

[Speaker 2]
You got some ice cream? Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, James. You gotta put on your best Italian accent here.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. Uh, I heard something about a dragon. Uh...

Welp, that's... Welp, after we defeat it, I got something to call it. Some dragon's dead, huh?

What? Anyways, go on. After when the dragon inevitably dies from our...

Gripes... Uh, we'll, uh... Celebrate with some punchin' ice.

[Speaker 1]
Mr. Opinious immediately starts guzzling some of the...

[Speaker 2]
I...

[Speaker 1]
Hey, give me some of that!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, gods. I mean, they're all... Okay, don't worry.

They're all like...

[Speaker 1]
I stole some party straws from the brothel. I don't know why they were there and not in the kitchen.

[Speaker 8]
Aww... Wait a minute.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 8]
Wait, I gotta...

[Speaker 5]
Wait, wait, I gotta...

[Speaker 8]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
It just came to me in the moment.

[Speaker 2]
Oh... Alright. Anyways...

Uh, Randall just had an idea about the prostitutes.

[Speaker 1]
I... No, no. Well, here's the thing.

You guys got, like, uh... I'll give you, like, I guess a minute left here.

[Speaker 3]
We gotta get ready. I'm gonna hold my action. We gotta find a floor.

We gotta get ready.

[Speaker 1]
I will. I will, however, let... Oh, sorry.

Go ahead. So you're casting Earthbind, correct?

[Speaker 6]
As soon as it gets in range. Literally the second, the instant it gets in range, I have my readied... I have my readied action to cast Earthbind.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so then we wanna get out of the tower and onto the ground? Or...

[Speaker 2]
I feel like we need the hide advantage. Actually, no, we'll fall off.

[Speaker 3]
We'll just stay on the ground. We should probably jump it.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, wherever we are fighting it, I want to chuck a hundred of these on the floor.

[Speaker 3]
Before... In the time we need to heal Edmund, how bad are you?

[Speaker 5]
I'm 91 hit points out of 117.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, damn. I thought you... I thought you took damage while you were...

[Speaker 5]
I did take damage.

[Speaker 4]
Looks alright.

[Speaker 5]
But I was healed.

[Speaker 4]
Barbaric... Okay, okay, okay. If you hold an action, can you also do a bonus action?

No. No?

[Speaker 6]
I can't even do any other concentration effects because reading a spell takes concentration. Oh, and these!

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'll...

[Speaker 5]
I wanna lay these around for this dragon. I've been saving these for this moment.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
So I have four of them. I'm gonna lay them down and kinda create this zone where if the dragon comes, can just alchemist fire and they'll all fucking explode. It's a concentrated blast.

[Speaker 1]
Air fuel bomb. Dynamite, interesting. Okay, cool.

[Speaker 2]
You know what?

[Speaker 3]
I have my dragon. Okay, so we're all outside of the tower on the ground?

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
This is a blue dragon, right?

[Speaker 3]
I'm trying to figure out where we are. Are we still inside the tower? Are we outside of the tower on the ground?

[Speaker 1]
Nobody said that they were exiting the tower. Did you see it?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so we're in the tower. Alright, we're gonna fight in the tower. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You can fight whenever you want, but you guys got a minute left before...

[Speaker 2]
There we go. Do I need to have a... for like a bomb type thing?

[Speaker 1]
Wait, just briefly. Is your DC above like 20? Me?

It should...

[Speaker 6]
Well, it's not tracking yet, but it should be DC 20. It's not counting an extra point for some reason.

[Speaker 5]
So yeah, Edmund's gonna basically lay some dynamite. Probably like... They're gonna be bundled together.

Like, four dynamite bundles all together.

[Speaker 6]
Just add plus five. 13. Plus another five from my wisdom.

18. Then plus two from my moonsickle, which would be 20.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
It's not counting it, but...

[Speaker 4]
That poor wizard that's just trapped.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know... His strength save bonus is... Oh, actually not high enough, I don't think.

Plus five, so... Is there a way to get him now? I know, so he just makes it, because his bonus is a plus 12.

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to do some extra spells to him, or anybody wants to do some extra spells to him, that's also fine, but now's your last opportunity. So, let's see what we got. Also drinking this.

I'll just edit it to make sure it actually functions properly.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a way to quickly free the wizard?

[Speaker 1]
Sure, how do you want to do that?

[Speaker 3]
Can a monk kick the chains?

[Speaker 1]
You can monk kick the chains? Tell it to her. Go ahead and make me an insight check.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Yeah. Sounds about right.

I got a nine. You got a nine? How did that happen?

[Speaker 8]
Hm?

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Okay. Why?

Never mind. I was really confused at first. You're not really sure?

Go ahead and make an attack roll versus them, and then tell me if you do anything else to it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I guess I'm going to attack. I mean, if this doesn't work, he's taking his gun turret.

What does the 12 do?

[Speaker 5]
That's 20. I think.

[Speaker 1]
That's a... That'll hit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. 11 damage.

[Speaker 1]
11 damage? Is that all you got?

[Speaker 3]
Um... I mean, I can do several more attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they're just kind of... You're kind of just like... Hurting the wizard a little bit.

[Speaker 3]
Are these normal chains?

[Speaker 1]
No, no. These are made out of arcane. Basically, this is the same...

It's made out of arcane force, right? So it's made out of the same shit as, like, magic missile.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I think that...

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I have magical. No, my spells didn't load over. No, I don't have spells.

I'll take you to something else. Never mind.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I went to Pathfinder, monk.

[Speaker 5]
Text, I think.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm going to have to submit that to the bug report section, because, like, the spell safety C from Moonsickle is just not applying correctly for some reason.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know how to get you out, man. I'm a monk.

[Speaker 8]
How do I...? You got nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so at this point, I'm going to have everybody roll initiative.

[Speaker 3]
Monk's just going to jump out the window onto the dragon. I'm sure it'll be fine.

[Speaker 1]
He'll have an opportunity to do that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. When he gets there, that's what he's going to do. I also can't go for much longer, because I have to get up early.

[Speaker 2]
Because we... Because this hasn't happened because we're traveling, I cannot give my initiative to other people, right?

[Speaker 1]
I understand what you mean, yeah. Yeah, so you just roll normally.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god, I actually rolled decently for initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we actually have a map now.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, it's a tower, so it's not really going to be useful to have.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we are outside.

[Speaker 1]
What? Why are you assuming that?

[Speaker 3]
I ask that so many times. Don't give an answer. We are all now inside the tower.

That's it.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, we're inside the tower. If somebody wanted to be outside, then the time to say that was a very long time ago.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I know, I know that. No, okay.

[Speaker 2]
I see dynamite pile and then new... Okay. I'm not going to question that.

[Speaker 1]
People are just scribbling on the map right now. That's what's going on.

[Speaker 5]
No, I said I was basically laying a pile of dynamite down for if the dragon walks through.

[Speaker 2]
Is that how big it would be?

[Speaker 5]
Well, yeah. It's a 20-foot radius. And then the pile of 100 little iron spikes around it.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like that's going to kill us more than it's going to kill the dragon.

[Speaker 5]
You clearly...

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's the future of our problem.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Out of curiosity, has our vision range changed back to what it was previously, or is it still 30 feet?

[Speaker 1]
It's still foggy, Misty, yeah?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I want that deleted.

[Speaker 2]
I'll be heal, I guess. Oh, that's the blue giant.

[Speaker 5]
I'm just going to get rid of that. All right, and now we're good, I think. How do I get out the...

Okay, that's all.

[Speaker 2]
You know what? I'm going to play a bit cowardly and hide behind one of you.

[Speaker 3]
You're supposed to, you're supposed to. I'm good.

[Speaker 2]
Which way is the dragon coming from?

[Speaker 5]
We don't know. However... We want to lure it into that pile.

That's the goal. If we do that, we can staff the dynamite. It's going to deal, I think, 66 times 4 damage.

[Speaker 1]
That's supposed to be...

[Speaker 5]
Do you all understand the plan?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Everybody who's there does. Monk's not there.

Good luck.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, I hope Monk doesn't...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, everybody immediately mark yourselves on a floor from 1 to 10. Or, sorry, of 1 to 5.

[Speaker 3]
Perfect wizard. Where's the observatory?

[Speaker 1]
That is 5. That's 5?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, 5. Charis went down to the sleeping room. Did she go back up?

Yeah. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Where was the... Where was the wizard hanging out at? It's not time to ask that.

[Speaker 1]
It's time for you to mark...

[Speaker 3]
Where do you want us to write it down? Just follow the group. Do you want it in an out-of-character chat?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. You go ahead, right-click your character token, and then indicate it as a number of feet up.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Which I should have specified. So basically, 1 would be first floor, second floor, third, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
So on and so forth.

[Speaker 3]
Is that just in settings?

[Speaker 1]
No, no. So what you do is you right-click your character token, like I said, and then there's a little... The top left has a 0 on it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, okay. I've never done it before.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine, you're fine. I don't know how to fix this stupid thing. It just says defeated, like, three...

It has, like, three different defeated tokens on it, so I got no means of adjusting that. Aw, that's fucking hysterical. Congratulations, Rola.

[Speaker 8]
You're a blizzard! Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. I think that the decadent music will actually go with this. Perfect.

We're just gonna start off with... Let's start off with something simple, and then we're gonna move on to throwing. The wizard is within 60 feet.

[Speaker 6]
And is the dragon in radius yet? Within 60 feet. How far is the dragon?

[Speaker 1]
60 feet. Alright. From the exterior of the thing here.

And what floor are you on? I'm going to assume third floor. Okay.

Okay, you're on the third floor. Fine. And...

You're making out a window, sure thing. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 7]
Wait, do not here. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Targeting the dragon, of course. Oh, fails. Hold just barely.

Alright, so it's gonna start falling down. Safely, of course.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
End of turn. Brings us to... Oh, there we go.

Randall.

[Speaker 2]
I'm on the floor where the punch bowl... Where I sent up the punch bowl.

[Speaker 1]
You guys carried it to the top floor, so you're on the fifth floor.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, got it. I'll set that up. Most people are on the fifth floor, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I already entered that. So what do you want to do with your turn?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I can shoot him from here. Yes, I can.

Dragon's 60 feet away. That's perfect. Can I shoot him twice with extra attack?

I forgot I had that. With pistols.

[Speaker 1]
Roll your attacks. Don't ask permission and don't narrate it.

[Speaker 7]
Just roll the attacks first, and then you can narrate it. Okay. Where is my...

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, press T on the enemy that you're attacking when you're attacking him.

[Speaker 2]
I don't see the enemy.

[Speaker 1]
That's right. Let me turn off... In that case, let me turn off...

In any case, I believe both of those miss. Anything with your bonus action?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Uh... We don't... Alright, we're going to move on to the next one.

If you want to use something with your bonus action, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
I will let you know. Type it in chat, Edmund. Yes, I will.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Bonus action, rage.

[Speaker 1]
And you did not mark what floor you're on, so now you're on 4-5. Alright. Which means that's also where the dynamite pile is.

Yup. 25 feet.

[Speaker 3]
That poor wizard... ...caned to wherever... ...is seeing the pile of dynamite.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I can move finally, thank god. There we go, right here. Perfect.

I don't know why it's doing that. Anyways... I can't reach anything.

I'm just going to use my action to dodge.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sure thing.

[Speaker 5]
And that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and who is after Edmund? That brings us to Charis.

[Speaker 4]
And this thing is, like, 60 feet away, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's quite correct.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, um... Alright. I am going to...

Hold my action, because there's nothing I can fucking do right now. Um... I will, uh...

Are we, like, on a roof?

[Speaker 3]
Or, like...

[Speaker 1]
You're inside the fifth floor.

[Speaker 4]
How the fuck is a dragon in the fifth floor?

[Speaker 3]
You said there was an observatory.

[Speaker 1]
How indeed. I say observatory like there's a telescope, but it's like an observatory-style telescope. There's other things inside instead.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
But there's a window. It's looking at me. Okay.

To go... To the fourth floor. You're going to the fourth floor.

Okay, anything for action or bonus action? Um... No.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I'm holding it.

[Speaker 3]
Monk. Yeah, I can't really do anything until the dragon gets there. Um...

What are the chains... That the wizards hooked up to? What are they going to?

Like, the desk?

[Speaker 1]
They're, like, just wrapped around him in the chair.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Can I move the chair?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, buddy! Let's go! I'm taking him down the stairs backwards.

Like...

[Speaker 4]
He's going backwards, and I'm pulling him down the stairs.

[Speaker 1]
Like...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah! He's still staring. He doesn't...

He has no idea what's going on.

[Speaker 1]
No, at this point, the panic has finally returned to his eyes. You guys have re-instilled this mortal dread into a mortal pain.

[Speaker 3]
There's Monk so good at doing that. Oh no!

[Speaker 1]
Alright. We've got the...

[Speaker 3]
Is there... Is there a place that I can put this guy where he's not going to get hurt? Like a...

Oh! A secret passage! He's throwing it out there.

Is there... Tell Monk that there's a secret passage.

[Speaker 1]
Honestly, what do you think would happen if he signs the book?

[Speaker 8]
Ooh!

[Speaker 1]
Oh, actually, we should just hide him behind it. That was a stupid idea. We should just hide him behind it.

[Speaker 3]
Also, protect him with my life.

[Speaker 1]
Before we go into bed tonight.

[Speaker 3]
Wait. Who's saying that? What?

[Speaker 1]
That's, uh, Christopher Penias.

[Speaker 3]
You don't have school tomorrow. Wait, no. You have one class tomorrow.

[Speaker 8]
Lab. What?

[Speaker 3]
We should... We should have him sign the book. Is Monk having him sign the book?

[Speaker 8]
I got confused.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. That was a joke. Alright, sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Anything else for Monk? Um, however much his turn gets him, down the stairs, down a floor, that's what Monk's doing. He's going to try to hide this guy.

[Speaker 1]
out of the tower. Everybody put yourselves inside of the... Everybody put yourselves inside the tower.

Everybody's outside for some reason.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody, you have ten seconds before I start moving people.

[Speaker 3]
Monk can go...

[Speaker 1]
I have a straight line that I can breath weapon.

[Speaker 3]
Monk can go sixty feet. So he's going sixty feet down the stairs. Oh, why can't I move?

Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 4]
It's lagging. I can't move my cocktail. Oh, wait, I did.

[Speaker 5]
I like how you just walk into the dynamite pile as if you're not...

[Speaker 4]
I'm downstairs.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but everybody's getting arranged inside this, so I can... I was going to get... I was going to get two guys anyway.

[Speaker 7]
We're going to reload.

[Speaker 1]
The game was paused, so don't reload. What are you doing?

[Speaker 3]
Paris, you and I are fine. We are not on the same floor as the other people. He can't see us.

Hopefully.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, so he's going to... fly on over... Now my game is lagging.

No, he couldn't. He's falling down, remember? Oh, no, that's correct.

So he falls down sixty feet, and then... What's up? Yes.

He falls down sixty feet, and then walks over until it reaches the ground or the spell ends. Does the spell actually... I don't...

Does the spell actually end when he reaches the ground, technically? Or... It's flying speed, if any, is reduced to zero feet for the spell's duration.

Spell's duration. One minute concentration. One minute.

Yeah, okay. That's right, so he will have to walk over. And then, I guess, he's going to have to dash up to the...

Let's see here. He's going to dash up to the third floor. Fuck!

That would be the end of his turn.

[Speaker 5]
He's coming.

[Speaker 1]
Her wizard's not going? Her wizard is going. Don't worry about it.

It's just what the thing did automatically here. So, there it is. Alright, Roman, you can go ahead and take your turn.

How are you going to get there?

[Speaker 6]
Do I currently see the dragon?

[Speaker 1]
You're on the fourth, right? Third. Since when are you on the third floor?

Didn't I mention that? Anyway... But no, seriously, did you just change that?

[Speaker 6]
No, I was already on the third floor, right? I thought... Now you're on the fifth floor, then.

Alright. Looks like I should probably start rushing up, then.

[Speaker 1]
Third floor is, as mentioned earlier, it's a bunch of different rooms. They're kind of separated. There's like a sauna.

There's a few bedrooms available. Like a master bedroom.

[Speaker 6]
But yeah, like I said, I'm just going to start rushing up, and... The sound of me dashing will probably attract attention. How far do you think I would make?

Fourth floor? Fifth floor?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, when you say rushing up, what do you... You mean upstairs? Yes.

Okay, if you want to do just movement, you'll get up to the next floor. If you want to dash, you'll go up to the fifth floor. Dash, so fifth floor.

Okay. End of turn.

[Speaker 2]
Cool, cool, cool, cool. That'll bring us to Randall. Okay.

So this pile of ion spikes, we're now just saying this is the tower?

[Speaker 1]
The circle is the tower. It's just a for vague positioning here.

[Speaker 2]
Vague positioning, got it. No, the dragon's still on the fourth floor, got it. Can I be...

Yeah, I guess I'll just do some movement. For where the door entrance is, can I just be kind of like behind that, so that way when the dragon comes through, I'll be behind the dragon? If you know what I mean.

I don't know what you mean. When the dragon goes through to the fifth floor, I'll be at the side of the door.

[Speaker 8]
You're on the fifth floor.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so I'm going to skip turns, and... Edmund.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I'm going to move outside of the dynamite blast radius. That's a smart choice. You said dragon's on the third floor?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
What about Perf? What floor is the wizard on?

[Speaker 1]
The last time you saw them, they were on the fourth floor.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Well, I'm going to... Can I ready my action to throw an alchemist's fire at the dynamite pile for when the dragon shows, but only if all my teammates are outside of the blast radius?

[Speaker 8]
Sure.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, that's what I'll do. That's what I'll ready my action to do.

[Speaker 1]
Aeris, what have you got?

[Speaker 4]
Alright. I will go back up. Cast...

You know what? No, I'm not going to cast anything. I'm just going to shoot.

I'm going to peek up. I'm going to peek up the stairs and shoot this guy. The dragon.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I like poking your head out the window and shooting.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, like a... one of those cop movies.

[Speaker 8]
I got you. I got you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, shit. Slash roll. 1d20.

13 plus 5? Yeah. 13 plus 5.

[Speaker 1]
So, 18. Can't just be plus 5. You have a proficiency bonus of plus...

3. Then you have your... And then your charisma is a plus 5.

And then the weapon itself is a plus 3.

[Speaker 4]
Right, proficiency bonus. I completely forgot about that. Right.

[Speaker 1]
You got to enter that weapon there. And how it does it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I definitely will. I don't want to fuck it up, though.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I got you. Don't be afraid to try it out first. But yeah, alright, so that will end.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, cool. 13 damage.

[Speaker 1]
We are off to a good start.

[Speaker 4]
And then I'll fly back down.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, that's 3d10 plus 3. So that's 16 damage. Plus your charisma modifier.

That's 21 damage. That brings us to Monk.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well he doesn't know the dragon is on the third floor yet. So he's going... He's still going.

He's going down the stairs. So he's going to be at the third floor now. Right?

[Speaker 8]
Mhm.

[Speaker 3]
I think he'll... Can he see the dragon from the stairs?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, from this side... He can certainly see...

[Speaker 3]
Or at least, can he tell the dragon's there?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think it's reasonable to tell the... Telling the dragon is there, that's totally fine. Because it's huge.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, he's probably going to be like... And keep going down the stairs.

[Speaker 4]
Keep dragging the wizard?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Which is the only reason he's still going. Because he's got...

He's got to get this guy somewhere safe.

[Speaker 1]
There's sort of pity at this point. It volunteers to take the wizard. And move with him.

He's like, boss, you gotta kill this thing. You gotta kill this thing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, alright, cool. Okay, so... I don't want you to die either, but don't...

Forget that I said that. Uh... Oh, no, okay.

Oh, I can't process that right now. Um... Gonna go to the dragon.

And... Can he go to the dragon? Or is that where his turn ends?

[Speaker 1]
No, he could go attack the dragon. You haven't used your action yet.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. Okay. I'm gonna...

Get on my health as well. Guess I'll do that.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to move my adjacent here.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're shooting it. Never mind.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I mean, I pictured... I didn't know how far my movement was. Don't worry about movement for...

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
This is just... Okay. Is it a 21 hit?

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know why it's still targeting the quagga. Oh, I actually don't know why it's doing that. I probably still had it targeted.

I targeted the dragon now.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Let's see if I break their damage right now.

[Speaker 3]
And I guess... If I sub my action... I'm going to shoot them once more.

Oh, I told you it doesn't hit, does it?

[Speaker 1]
That one does miss.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Do I have my bonus action?

[Speaker 1]
48 plus 40. Oh, I do. Now I remember.

That's why I had to steal this one. Now I totally remember it.

[Speaker 3]
But Santa brought it back.

[Speaker 1]
And now it's just not applying damage. Okay, so... Sorry, what else were you doing on your turn?

[Speaker 3]
I still have my bonus action, right? I mean, this is my full turn. Okay, I guess I'll...

Move, and then I'm going to hit it with my staff.

[Speaker 4]
Oops, I immediately... I'm trying to fix it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, 15 doesn't hit, does it? 15, unfortunately, no. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my, I don't think I have disengaging. So... Here I is.

That's my turn. This'll be fun. It's still just not loading for me.

So I'm going to... Let's try it again. My favorite part...

Opening a browser is where it just kind of refuses to do... Okay, cool. We're switching now.

Back to Firefox. Don't take ages for me now. Let's just do it.

Okay, we're good to go.

[Speaker 4]
I'm back.

[Speaker 7]
Things are looking up. He's going to... Right-click.

There we go. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
So he's going to stick his head up the fifth floor here.

[Speaker 7]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
Uh, did you read my out-of-character chat thing?

[Speaker 1]
What? Please have... Shoot if I see the dragon within 60-foot range.

Yeah, sure, you can shoot him.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Because I didn't take an action this turn, so... Because I said ready to action.

[Speaker 1]
That's totally fine. And did I diminish his hit points twice? I did.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... I believe... Yeah, it's a ready to action.

[Speaker 1]
You have, like, ten seconds to shoot him.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I know. Go to roles. Attack.

Attack twice. God! Okay, neither of those do damage.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. He's going to creep around the side here. Okay, I need Randall and Rowan to go ahead and make me some saving throws.

Wait, what? What do you mean, wait, what? Wasn't this, like, vague positioning?

[Speaker 6]
Like, wasn't I, like, just now entering the fifth floor?

[Speaker 1]
No, just now entering the fifth floor? No, but you're on the fifth floor, and it's, like, 125 feet long. So if he wants to connect two people, that's not going to be a problem.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, absorb elements time.

[Speaker 1]
Probably a good idea. Alright, that is... Randall, do you have anything to diminish lightning damage?

Or damage at all?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is... 75 damage.

[Speaker 2]
Is everybody level 8, or am I the only one level 8?

[Speaker 4]
Charis is level 8, somehow. I think I missed some... some XP along the way.

[Speaker 1]
You have definitely not been applying XP to your character sheet. Or if you have, you've only been doing it to your token.

[Speaker 4]
I am at, currently, 23,000. I feel like you should be past level 8.

[Speaker 3]
You use her all the time. 23,000? Wait, so 20...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that can't be...

[Speaker 1]
It was, like, 23,000 last time I looked at it. And on top of that, it's, like, 36,000 minimum for... Yeah, that should be higher.

[Speaker 3]
You gotta go through the Discord and collect the XP and put it in your character sheet.

[Speaker 4]
But then I don't know what I have and what I haven't, but I'm pretty sure each time I do.

[Speaker 1]
There's just no way for it to be 23,000 without something being fucked. So I assume probably D&D Beyond messed up a bit.

[Speaker 4]
Does that mean I can get a free level up?

[Speaker 1]
Go find that XP. May have been the case. Alright, and the last thing that this dragon starts doing is...

The breath does not dissipate. I'm going to mark him as concentrating on his breath weapon. And that is his turn.

I'm going to run up to the 4th floor here. Which I'm not familiar with, it's just a giant open field here.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I have a funny feeling. I need to roll that con save, though. Yep, the dragon now has his flying speed back.

[Speaker 7]
That will be okay, I think it'll be okay without it.

[Speaker 1]
You know what, I just had no reason to update the obvious here, let's just keep everything simple. Keep everything nice and simple. Alright, so I need Taris and Monk to make me...

Stereo saving throws.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Is this against the blast?

[Speaker 1]
It is, and it is. If you succeed... Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Obvious wizard enemy turns out to be enemy. Fuck.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Succeeds.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, Monk does not succeed.

[Speaker 3]
Hang on, I have... I'm looking for it. No!

[Speaker 1]
At last. You will take damage from this.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hang on. I have evasion.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you'll take half damage. You're still taking damage.

[Speaker 3]
If I take half damage, I take no damage. Am I taking half damage?

[Speaker 1]
No, you're taking half damage, because you would take full damage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, damn it! Okay. So, 34...

Oh, how's Taris doing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, 34 damage to Taris, and then 17 fire damage to Monk. And now we come to Rowan.

[Speaker 8]
Ow.

[Speaker 6]
And then I'm gonna... Move right here. Um...

[Speaker 4]
Move my page.

[Speaker 1]
What do you got, Rowan?

[Speaker 6]
Just a nut and whiskers gun. Need a wisdom save.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, cool. And you use... What did you use earlier?

Did you... Remind me, it's been a while. What does Absorb Elements do?

[Speaker 6]
It provides resistance to the triggering damage. Oh, good, good, good.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, applies. I... I'm very sorry.

I also have Absorb Elements. Can I... Is it too late for me, because I'm, like, very slow-minded?

[Speaker 1]
No, that's fine. It's just... Wait a second.

So, Rowan, you have... You have 75 hit points to begin with. You took full damage, and resistance would halve the damage.

You should have... Did you... Wait, did you have temporary hit points?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, because, remember from the thing way earlier, as Survivalist?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's what occurred. I was like, wait a minute. This is what...

Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna do a wisdom saving throw, plus, um... But not four, I need four.

There it goes. Alright. I will Legendary Resist that.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, so just three damage. All using a full Legendary Resistance.

[Speaker 5]
I wanted to Rowan. Damage.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, and it's your turn.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it takes half as much damage, yeah, so three, apply, and...

[Speaker 2]
Alright, and who is after Rowan? Uh, I think me.

[Speaker 8]
Yes, it is you.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just gonna give myself 37 more hit points because of Absorber Elements.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, but what are you doing... That was like, a turn ago.

[Speaker 2]
What are you doing with your turn right now? Yes. Okay, uh...

I'm 30 feet away, I'm just gonna use it. Targeted, yes, shrapnel charge. Usability, yes.

Can I? No, I can't. Okay, cast Spell Heal, then...

God, that sucked. Okay. Does it still take half damage, or is it just...

[Speaker 1]
No, it's making a con save or something else. What are you doing?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, got it. Make an attack... Do I even make an attack with this?

[Speaker 6]
I mean, presumably, if that's like...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it does still save, it just takes the damage. Because it's so consumable.

[Speaker 1]
It's within 10 feet, so...

[Speaker 2]
And then as a bonus... Actually, no, it's a free object interaction. Since I used that, I'm going to doff on my shield again.

Object interaction, doff shield. Then bonus action, since I did make an attack, I'll mark it as my favorite foe.

[Speaker 1]
Downing and doffing a shield is an action. I thought... I thought...

Weapons, object interaction, downing and doffing a shield is an action.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, got it. And I... Wait, an action?

Not a bonus?

[Speaker 6]
Bonus action would be if you had the Thief subclass of Rogue.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so can I doff a weapon? I guess it doesn't matter. But yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Edmund, your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Can I still mark it as my favorite foe? No, that's a bonus. Yes, if you still have your bonus action, I think.

Mark it as favorite foe.

[Speaker 1]
And then, Riz, if you are speaking, I can't hear you, that's fine.

[Speaker 5]
I'm using Fire Giant's might. Can... 22?

Does that hit? No, I get advantage because I'm raging. Because it's an athletics roll.

Alright. Time for damage.

[Speaker 1]
So are you ending your turn inside... If you're ending your turn inside the Lightning Bolt, you're going to take damage.

[Speaker 2]
I know, I said in OOC. 37. Yeah, you can always move during your turn.

I didn't know if the Lightning was also holding me in place or something like that. No, I gotcha. Alright, so 37 damage?

[Speaker 5]
Yes. 2d6 bludgeoning, 22 bludgeoning, 1d6 force. And 2 bludgeoning.

Question, would you allow me to make my second attack with Fire Giant's might since it doesn't specify once per turn?

[Speaker 1]
No, you do twice for long rest. You may invoke one of the following effects. So, you could...

You could expend your second use, assuming that you haven't...

[Speaker 5]
Yes, that's the plan.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Speaker 8]
Fire damage.

[Speaker 5]
21 hits, maybe?

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. And for this attack in particular, I'm going to use Fire Strike. To add an additional d10.

Of fire damage. That damage seems to be right. 46 damage.

Oh, man.

[Speaker 1]
Good rolls.

[Speaker 5]
The Wisdom Saving Throw, you can't ignore that, by the way.

[Speaker 1]
What's the Wisdom Saving Throw for?

[Speaker 5]
It would be for Cloud Strike, but I'm using Fire Strike because that's the one I selected. I don't know why it has this whole line of text.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I thought you said you can't ignore that.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Look at me. Well, it's about time I start using these.

We're going to use a Legendary Action to...

[Speaker 5]
You miss me, beast?

[Speaker 4]
Hit you with a tail. Rude.

[Speaker 5]
Crits.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, even...

[Speaker 1]
Was it a crit? Ooh, oh. My apologies.

Much better.

[Speaker 5]
Reaction, Stones, Endurance.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
So I have that, and then roll the d12. Add my con. Okay.

I take zero damage.

[Speaker 1]
That's fucking awesome. Alright, we come now to Karis.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm going to pray to all the gods that are out there. And I'm going to curse their wisdom.

[Speaker 8]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
Which one?

[Speaker 4]
The dragon.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, go ahead and pick that.

[Speaker 4]
I tried. Let me try that again. It is...

[Speaker 3]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[Speaker 1]
Is it popping off on anybody else's screen? Because it's not doing it on mine.

[Speaker 4]
Not on mine. Maybe I should reload again. I'll reload, but I am doing that.

Man. And that is... It's a necromancy thing, so I can't use my gun.

[Speaker 1]
Let's have Mega Wisdom. I should just have Mega Wisdom save right now. Go on.

Mega Wisdom save. Got a 16.

[Speaker 3]
Um, oh. I can spend a ki point if you fail. Oh, never mind.

It's the dragon.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not scared. It would be 16 if you were level 8, but as we discussed, you're actually level 9. So it would fail.

[Speaker 4]
Did that... Did it pop up that time?

[Speaker 1]
No, I just had to make a roll.

[Speaker 4]
What the hell?

[Speaker 1]
Is it on private rolls?

[Speaker 4]
No, it's not even rolling for some reason.

[Speaker 1]
That's weird.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that is weird.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so I'm going to have it do...

[Speaker 4]
Can you go through my... Can you try to through mine?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, I'll give it a shot here. Cast spell. And it also just didn't work.

[Speaker 8]
Huh. What's she trying to do?

[Speaker 1]
She's trying to cast Bestow Curse, but it's just not going to the chat.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, there it is. Why does it let me? Nice.

I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Weird. I had no idea, but that worked out nicely. It didn't let me do it, which is hilarious.

Anyway, so it fails.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome. Okay. I did that so that I could cast other things on it, so that other people can cast some things on it.

[Speaker 1]
So yeah. Curse. Alright, anything with a bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to hide behind cover. What floor is he on?

[Speaker 1]
So he's huge, so you can see him through a bunch of different floors, but his head is currently poking through floor 5.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll go down to floor 4. Well, yeah, I'll go back down to floor 4. And I will be right back.

But yeah, that's my go. Oh, actually, hold on. Before we do anything, I want to Bardic Inspiration Monk.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
While you're doing that, I'm going to do something hilarious and Tail Attack.

[Speaker 4]
Rude.

[Speaker 8]
How rude?

[Speaker 1]
I can maintain concentration on one or more effects. Well, a Tail Attack is not really a concentration effect to my knowledge. Oh, here we go.

[Speaker 6]
Could be like something kind of messy in there.

[Speaker 1]
Which one are you not hitting?

[Speaker 7]
Me? No, it's...

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, 29 hits. 15 halved.

[Speaker 8]
And now it's time to monk.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'll use my last.

[Speaker 1]
Just Misses.

[Speaker 3]
Just Misses? What is the Bardic... Is the Bardic Inspiration before or after?

Um, it's a... You could spend it on this. Cool.

Is it a d4?

[Speaker 1]
No, I think it's like a d10, but it doesn't matter. You literally just missed it, so...

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
That charge gap. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, mate.

[Speaker 1]
I can... Cool. I miss anything?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, bloody. Your Bardic Inspiration is awesome. Um...

[Speaker 5]
Damn, I nuked it.

[Speaker 3]
And then, I guess... For my second attack, I will try to hit it with my Water Sphere.

[Speaker 4]
Did we short rest earlier?

[Speaker 3]
No, we just healed because we didn't want to take the time.

[Speaker 4]
I think it worked out in our favor.

[Speaker 6]
And then we didn't long rest when we had the chance. No, all those beds were mimics. You weren't able to take the chance.

So, we were just going to be betrayed. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
We have one more Bardic Inspiration left. Alright. Um...

Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, and then for my bonus action, I will do Flurry of Blows. I'm just assuming if I get over 20, I get a hit.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that'd be...

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Okay. I don't know why he got moved.

He had to be.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to use his last legendary action.

[Speaker 3]
The round.

[Speaker 5]
Is he coming right back at Edmund?

[Speaker 3]
Of course.

[Speaker 5]
Lovely. Hits. You hit like a fucking ant.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, did I make me a deck save? Because he's going to change, and then the tortle can make me a deck save as well.

[Speaker 3]
That's not the ending of that insult I thought you were going to say. I make a deck save.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, okay, okay. I can see this advantage. Even then, roll a 9.

Alright.

[Speaker 2]
I think...

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, nice. If I want to use it again later.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
71.

[Speaker 2]
Do I... Can I do Absorb Elements again?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, you don't have to ask for permission.

[Speaker 2]
You have the spell slots.

[Speaker 1]
You have the reaction, and the spell slots are good to go. Okay. And it looks like you need it.

[Speaker 2]
Why half damage? Okay, I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. We're going to come to the top of it with Perv Wizard.

[Speaker 5]
I think the wizard's pervy.

[Speaker 1]
You think? I gotta get this fucking monk out of here.

[Speaker 3]
What? No, no, no, it's fine, no, it's fine. No, no.

[Speaker 1]
Why should I use Silvery Barbs? Oh, I'm a fucking idiot. It's okay.

We can recover from this. We're in a cast.

[Speaker 5]
Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
Cast us at third level. On.

[Speaker 7]
On Monk and Karis.

[Speaker 1]
I need both of you to make me some Intelligence Saving Throws. A what? Intelligence Saving Throws.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you bastard.

[Speaker 3]
Hang on, I mean... I think I might be able to use a ki point if we fail.

[Speaker 4]
Praying to all the gods that will listen. This poor fairy. The gods hate me, damn.

They don't think I'm trustworthy. I lost.

[Speaker 3]
They are not listening. I'll spend a ki point, you can reroll that. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
That's why I wanted to reroll for the camper earlier. I'm going to fail it again, but I thank you for this opportunity.

[Speaker 1]
And Monk, keep in mind, you also have to roll.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I know, I just wanted to...

[Speaker 3]
Otherwise I was going to get confused.

[Speaker 1]
You wanted to give space to her.

[Speaker 3]
I wanted to make sure she was taken care of.

[Speaker 1]
Your condolences.

[Speaker 3]
Is an 18 good?

[Speaker 1]
It's a good roll, definitely. You did take 6 damage, that's dog shit.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
On your next turn, you'll get to choose between a move, an action, or a bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
We can only do one?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 3]
I already know my action. Also, since I hit that guy with my staff, he can't regain hit points until my next turn.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, which is pretty great.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Rowan.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah?

[Speaker 5]
You think it'd be possible to get the wizard in the pile?

[Speaker 4]
You do it!

[Speaker 5]
You do it and they're fucked.

[Speaker 4]
What level is the wizard on? 5.

[Speaker 5]
You're counting on your own.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I have lair actions. I should use this. Wait, no, no, no.

I shouldn't use this. It'd be really funny if I had thorn whip, but I unfortunately don't. No, I should do this instead.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, there's gotta be some you can do.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Okay, Evan, go ahead and make me a DC 15 next to every second throw.

[Speaker 5]
I can see it.

[Speaker 1]
Still. Fails. You are...

From Restraint.

[Speaker 5]
I'll apply half.

[Speaker 1]
And he's going to do a legendary action for a one attack. Is that wise, Rowan? No.

You fear the dragon, that's just you. Alright, go ahead and make me a Dex save with... Well, it would be advantage, but...

Normal? Yes, it is normal. Fool, fucking makes it.

Yeah, which means he'll avoid the damage entirely. Oh, he's just going to fly further out. I'll make you Concentrating Breath weapon with him.

It's like back here. Go further out.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so yeah. I won't be able to actually do anything with that dynamite because I'm restrained.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, now we come to Rowan.

[Speaker 6]
Well, looks like this plan's fucked.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, you can still get him inside the pile.

[Speaker 6]
This is true.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we'll just grapple him, take one for the team.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no. I'm going to do a very simple thing. I need that dragon to make a Wisdom save.

With disadvantage, since that was the one that was given disadvantage for Bestow Curse, right? Indeed it was.

[Speaker 1]
I made it disadvantage. Oh, well this is going to suck.

[Speaker 8]
I'll be out of here.

[Speaker 6]
Now, this may be a terrible idea, but as this happens, my guy, Rowan, is going to taunt the dragon and say it's a bitch for running.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we didn't know if it was running. It could have just been regrouping to Breath of the Wild. I know!

But we needed to come back. But I don't know, what do we have to lose?

[Speaker 6]
We needed to come back for that dynamite pile to actually be useful.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So, taunting. Naturally, my character is going to move out of this dynamite pile.

[Speaker 1]
Reasonable. Alright, Randall, this is the last round I can do for now, by the way.

[Speaker 2]
I can, like, resolve some of the rest of these rolls. Okay, yeah. The constitution was for favorite foe thing.

I'm going to obviously move out of the deadly weapon thing.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, you know...

[Speaker 7]
Shove the wizard in there.

[Speaker 3]
Shove the wizard in there. Oh yeah, I can do... The wizard's a bitch, it's a wizard.

Blow him up.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I actually can do that, actually.

[Speaker 3]
Do it.

[Speaker 2]
Action. Action, put on shield. So that way, move here.

Yeah, I think I can do this. Shove action with shield into the dynamite.

[Speaker 1]
Shield bash requires that you make an attack during your turn.

[Speaker 6]
You could, however, just make a shove as part of the special attack, because...

[Speaker 2]
You're saying just, like, attack, but don't do a weapon?

[Speaker 1]
That is something you can do. I'm shocked. Well, no, the attack action is still an action.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but instead of damage, I do a shove.

[Speaker 1]
Right, but that requires an action. Yeah, I'm not going to put off shield. You're not going to put your shield on.

Okay, yeah, no, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Uh...

[Speaker 1]
Contested athletics?

[Speaker 2]
Been a while. Uh, do I just make, is it an unarmed strike?

[Speaker 5]
No, you make an athletics, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And the target is going to do acrobatics to get away from this one.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, athletics versus acrobatics.

[Speaker 1]
You have to beat him up.

[Speaker 2]
Yes!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and re-roll that with...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, silvery barbs type crap.

[Speaker 1]
I'm deciding if I want chronal shift or silvery barbs.

[Speaker 5]
If you succeed this, by the way, we get a significant advantage in this fight.

[Speaker 1]
I'll do a little silvery barbs as a treat. Yeah, go ahead and re-roll.

[Speaker 2]
Yes!

[Speaker 6]
So, because it would have to be the lower value, it's still 15.

[Speaker 5]
In that fucking pile. Alright, Monk, you're going to have to do the honors.

[Speaker 3]
Monk? He's a floor below, you're going to have to call for me.

[Speaker 5]
I'm restrained. Sarah's probably good, though.

[Speaker 6]
And, uh, here's the thing. Because it's a special melee attack, you can't, you still have one of your extra attack. Chariz can't do anything.

[Speaker 5]
Making my strength check, I'm now no longer restrained.

[Speaker 3]
There you go.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Even if I'm prone, I can still chuck it. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to throw it at the dynamite pile.

And ignite the motherfucker. So this...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, what are you...

[Speaker 5]
Light him up!

[Speaker 1]
Hey, what are you talking about?

[Speaker 5]
Using your action. Yes, I thought someone said I could use my... No, I was referring to the shove thing.

Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Because that's a special melee attack, and thus counts for extra attack.

[Speaker 5]
Never mind. So I at least use my action to unrestrain myself.

[Speaker 1]
You stand up. I assume.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Uh, what could I do here? I shot Deseris to ignite it with whatever she has.

[Speaker 4]
I literally can't. Fuck! I have a...

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I get... My turn kind of just got... Didn't you say I had an extra attack?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you have an extra attack. But if you want to use it, you gotta... Jump on it.

[Speaker 2]
Jump.

[Speaker 3]
Do it now. Do it now. Yeah, of course.

[Speaker 1]
Do it now or forever hold your peace. And then decide what you're doing with your bonus action and movement. Uh, but quietly.

While Randall does this.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm just going to... I could always correct. Uh, 22, that...

That battle hitter with a sword.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, you're not shooting the dynamite? Oh.

[Speaker 3]
You're shooting the dynamite. Uh... I...

[Speaker 5]
I'm... The...

[Speaker 2]
Please say you're shooting the dynamite. Mine is a pneumatic pistol, which means it uses gas. It wouldn't...

It wouldn't catch anything on fire.

[Speaker 1]
It shoots a rod, but if you just hit something with steel, like it needs to spark.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, if it would walk, then I would have shot the dynamite pile.

[Speaker 1]
Was there something else you could have done?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, not really. Anything with a bonus action?

[Speaker 8]
Okay, James.

[Speaker 5]
Would you allow me to hold out my alchemist flask with my bonus action for Cerys to receive as her bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
I only have one action. We can only do one thing. Yeah, I can only do one thing on my next turn.

[Speaker 1]
You can pull something out of your curse pack. You just can't use your melee weapon while you're doing it.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I use my movement to go slow down.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I pull out the alchemist flask. Cerys? I'm right by you.

It's easy to take it from my hand. Just chuck it. That's my turn.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I chuck it.

[Speaker 5]
At the dynamite pile. Let's go.

[Speaker 4]
At the dynamite pile, I chuck it. This is if this gets me killed, because I was going to drink a potion. If this gets me killed, you're going to bring me back.

[Speaker 5]
6d6 times 4.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, so what do I... How do I roll to throw it?

[Speaker 1]
No, wait a second. You guys aren't shooting the, um... Well, no, you would be able to shoot the...

You would be able to shoot the wizard by going down the floor, but the wizard is... ...on the fourth floor. What?

What do you mean, what? The wizard's on the fourth floor?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, the wizard went down to the fourth floor.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then I'm drinking my potion.

[Speaker 1]
No, really, they were on the third floor, and then they went one up.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Linda would still be able to fire by going downwards.

[Speaker 4]
Drinking my potion, you guys can kiss my ass. No, do it. Drink your potion.

I get 70.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, this is so frustrating.

[Speaker 4]
It's better than nothing. Alright, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then we come to the monk.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Oh, dragon went away? Fuck.

Okay, I guess I'm gonna go to wherever the stupid wizard is. Go up the stairs and get to them.

[Speaker 1]
You know, the wizard, you're on the same floor as the wizard right now.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well then I'm gonna walk over to the wizard and punch its face.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, fuck the wizard.

[Speaker 3]
I know. Oh, I can only do one thing, huh?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you gotta choose an action, a bonus action, or...

[Speaker 3]
Okay, then I'm not gonna move. I've got blow darts.

[Speaker 1]
I thought you were gonna use a gift.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna... I have no more stuff on my shotgun, so I'm just gonna blow dart them if it lets me. Lagging.

[Speaker 4]
I should have cursed his intelligence, dammit.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hey, it worked. Yeah, it worked? You can see it?

Yeah. Oh, okay, it was... Oh, it lagged so bad.

Everything caught up now. Okay. And I'm just gonna...

Do it twice.

[Speaker 1]
What's your martial arts style now?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. I have to look.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you get two attacks. Oh, that's a damage roll.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, I... I doubt it's really changed. I'm only level nine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, man. You're not looking so good.

[Speaker 3]
Good. Do I have to roll to break out of whatever I'm stuck in? No, I think it just ends.

[Speaker 7]
Paris, move!

[Speaker 3]
You can't move. I'm gonna kill you on my next turn, whenever that is. If I have to wait a week...

It's gonna happen.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to take his action.

[Speaker 3]
Martial diet is 1d6.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the first thing he's gonna do is he's going to just turn.

[Speaker 7]
Out of spite.

[Speaker 1]
Also, it's a lot of damage, and it feels so good.

[Speaker 6]
Does that also hit the wizard? No, they're on the fourth floor. What, it hit the wizard?

So, it just hit me and Edmund.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, the turtle is also on the... Fourth floor. All right, Edmund.

[Speaker 5]
Dex time.

[Speaker 1]
Dex save.

[Speaker 5]
19. I pass.

[Speaker 6]
My specialty. Like, I can't even pass this. That's the thing.

It's DC 19. I have a negative 2.

[Speaker 5]
Half as much.

[Speaker 1]
All right, there goes my last.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Instead of base weight, it's 80, 40, 40.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I take 26 points of damage. Stones endurance. Reaction?

[Speaker 4]
What level is that on? It's not us. We're good.

We're good? I'm good? Yeah, we're good.

You're good. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Plus 5.

[Speaker 3]
We have the belly and the tail.

[Speaker 5]
I take, I think, 13 points of damage.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. We're good.

[Speaker 5]
I'm still kicking, boys.

[Speaker 1]
All right, then. He is going to use his action to dash. And he's open to run away.

And get ready to fight another day.

[Speaker 5]
This motherfucker.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to move 160 feet out.

[Speaker 4]
He really is a bitch.

[Speaker 1]
Is he forever cursed?

[Speaker 4]
He is a bitch. Is he able to get rid of my curse? He will forever have to live with the fact that I was right.

[Speaker 5]
He will forever have to live with the fact he couldn't even kill a fucking human.

[Speaker 3]
Do we get the sense he's running far, far away?

[Speaker 2]
He's trying to.

[Speaker 3]
Like, away from the area so we don't have to worry about him? No, no, he's still going to be in the area.

[Speaker 1]
Son of a bitch. He's the tower. I still have more spells left for him.

[Speaker 4]
Is it going to fucking move? Is it going to disappear again? No, because the wizard is still alive.

Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the wizard that owns the tower is still alive.

[Speaker 7]
But more importantly, this wizard is also still alive. So, how would you guys...

[Speaker 1]
I don't know, I think you guys could probably take the purple. I feel like if you guys focus on the wizard, you'll be able to...

[Speaker 4]
I want to curse his intelligence. And I'm going to do it by just making him think he's stupid.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, if you make him stupid, then he's stupid enough for me to have him as a pet.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, ethical cadre of slavery!

[Speaker 2]
Alright! I think we'll call it here. He's a pawvault, okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's literally in his name.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's just his name? Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, are we entering out of the turn order? Yeah, we're ending here.

[Speaker 1]
Basically what's going to happen is you guys are going to face dragon ambushes throughout the next few days. And you're going to have to maintain control over the wizard.

[Speaker 2]
Is he actually a pawvault? Can I kill him?

[Speaker 5]
You can not just kill him.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know why, but I just feel like it's such a unique way for me to be introduced.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what the expectation here is, but... I don't know either!

[Speaker 7]
You know how people have a pet who's a pawvault?

[Speaker 1]
I still got two left, so I'm just going to Legendary Resist.

[Speaker 7]
Can we just let him float far, far, far below until he was able to... No, he just... He lasts for a minute, right?

Yeah. Which gives us a little bit of time.

[Speaker 1]
He doesn't have time, it's just during the next week he's going to attempt ambushes on the party.

[Speaker 7]
Makes sense. I'm going to create a threat here for the dragon hunt. Remember, you guys...

So what I'm going to do is... Nobody take a long rest. We're using the slow natural healing variant.

You guys are going to need to heal slowly. Well, I do have Order of Vitality.

[Speaker 6]
I have two spell slots left. Which is good! Yeah, so I could just heal the majority of the damage back up.

[Speaker 1]
Well, not just. You can heal the exact portions and determine who that's going to. And exactly how many spell slots are being taken.

Hun, recall that you're not restoring all of your spell slots in a given night. That is true. And then, there's the when the dragon comes back.

Yeah, but as a druid... Yes.

[Speaker 6]
And as a druid, because the spell slot, while traveling on a long rest, they work a bit differently. They get better.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they get higher than most people get.

[Speaker 6]
They get their level in total spell slot level. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
So you're at nine? Yeah. I see you get like three threes.

You get three, a two, and four ones.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, which would allow me to effectively mean that we would not have to use as much of our hit dice as we would otherwise have to. Oh, ever track it? Exactly.

[Speaker 7]
Mhm. Alright. I see more tags.

We should probably just go ahead and start divvying up the healing rune.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just do a little bit at a time.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, let's start with Edmund. Alright. Does this count as a short rest?

Yeah, you guys can short rest before your long rest and stuff like that. Basically, I wonder if it could be... You'll give me a day by day for everything that you do here, and because the dragon is going to be out there.

Alright, Edmund, did you get the d16?

[Speaker 8]
Yep.

[Speaker 7]
Alright. I said record everything that you do, and here we go. Blue dragon to white rook.

[Speaker 3]
With the zealot's recompense, do the charges come back every day?

[Speaker 7]
Do what charges come back every day?

[Speaker 3]
The zealot's recompense. I only get three charges.

[Speaker 7]
That comes back every day.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Fly. Fly. Fly.

Fly. That was a pretty good session. Definitely ran a little bit long.

[Speaker 1]
There's always that two hour block that's supposed to be just talking, but it was funny.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, do you want me to top you off or just move on to series?

[Speaker 7]
Top me off. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Perfect. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'll get your character up next.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I don't know. Maybe you're healing them because they're more powerful or something?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's a good thing to have someone there to, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay. No, I didn't know if you just completely forgot about it. Spellcasters aren't going to have many spell slots left after this to begin with.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm just getting, you know, our biggest, you know, more powerful people up to that point.

[Speaker 1]
If and when they get ambushed during the night, then their option is going to be...

[Speaker 6]
Slim. Which is where the zombies come in.

[Speaker 2]
Whenever I sleep, by the way, I'm in my shell, which gives me a DC of, not DC, AC of plus four. That's handy. Yeah, unless if they use a spell, then it's not really annoying.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's for a breath weapon. That's the important part.

[Speaker 2]
Can I do my short rest hit dice? You sure can.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Last time we did short was a natural healing, slow natural healing. And the last time I did it as a player, our standard operating procedure was to do a short rest before the long rest.

Because the long rest is when we got our hit points back. No, when we got our hit points back. The long rest was when we got our hit dice back.

So if we got attacked during the night and we had spent the dice with the short rest before we went to sleep, then we would have some extra hit points to prepare for that fight.

[Speaker 2]
Am I allowed to roll as many as I want? Because some people have house rule that you can only roll one for every hour you sleep. Or like rest.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, I got to go to bed. But like I said, just record what you spent.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 6]
So, do I use up my only 5th level spell slot?

[Speaker 4]
If I short rest, I can just use my hit dice. Okay, I'll probably just do the same, save my 5th level spell slot. Is it slow healing?

I don't understand it too much.

[Speaker 7]
I think you can do the...

[Speaker 8]
Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
I was thinking, if we're doing a short rest, that's where you use your hit dice so you can heal up. But it's just going to take time now for you to get your hit dice back. Because he said you recover one die, so I'm guessing one die each long rest will get it back.

[Speaker 7]
If you're in town, then you would get half of your hit dice back.

[Speaker 3]
So, you use your hit dice in the short rest.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I'll just use my hit dice now.

[Speaker 3]
And you stress Monk out.

[Speaker 6]
I have less use of it than our marshals.

[Speaker 3]
Too spishy for him to handle.

[Speaker 6]
I'll just save my 5th level spell slot as a break glass in case of emergency. Just deploy Cloud Kill to perform more crimes if something tries ambushing us.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to shoot my gun really quick just to make sure that it works. Not actually in game, this is just me testing to make sure that I didn't fuck it.

[Speaker 7]
It's so hard to find that.

[Speaker 2]
Did you guys kill Parv?

[Speaker 3]
In the group chat that was just added, I said, Monk is tying them up until we figure out what we're going to do.

[Speaker 7]
I could have tossed another Fireball out, which would have been funny, but I have no practical point to extending at this point. The dragon fled, so it's fitting. I'm just going to surrender.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, given that, I am very tempted to, if we do decide to kill him, just use Fungal Infestation, make him undead, and therefore not resurrectable.

[Speaker 5]
Why?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's just because I, myself, like stretching the limits of what something can do. Can I seriously try to, like, if you bash him on the head hard enough, can't I just Animal Tame him?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know why you keep going back to that.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know why!

[Speaker 6]
The ethical quadris of slavery.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, humans are animals.

[Speaker 6]
Which is funny, considering, because of Rakdos Cultus, I actually do have nominate version.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to remove you from my bag limit and start hunting in the wild.

[Speaker 4]
The most dangerous game. That's fun.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm not going to do that.

[Speaker 5]
I tanked a lot today.

[Speaker 3]
You did.

[Speaker 5]
And I had, like, 33 hit points at the end of boot.

[Speaker 3]
You did really good. I love barbarians because, like, how little damage they take.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, and you just got back up to full without having, like, I think you at most used, like, one hit dice or something?

[Speaker 5]
No, I used zero hit dice. All I was using was my herbalist dice. I'm trying to recover those.

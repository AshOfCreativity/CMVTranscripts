[James]
All right, um, testing one two three.

[Speaker 6]
We can hear you. Hello.

[James]
Hey, all right, it seems everything is working as intended. What was the first of July? It was a Tuesday.

You got this.

[Heart]
How was your fourth of July?

[James]
Uh, very sleepy. See, what I did was I set an alarm that would actually be much earlier and offer me even more time to get my prep ready. In fact, so, so early enough that if I wanted to, I could probably sneak at least one half hour nap in there, which I did.

But I in fact, sent two half hour naps in there because I overslept the second alarm, which is usually not what happens. And that's why oversleeping the second alarm, I woke up at, uh, 3 55 my time and got a very quick shower. So I would not be hideously late as I was last time.

I was nearly the appropriately late.

[Landie]
It's okay. I can delay us by playing the piano for an hour.

[James]
Yes. We have to do one to one time. One to one scale.

One to one tempo. Nice. I deleted everything here.

Before you guys go in, dwarves are going to inform you that the giant snake has taken residence in the very top floor. So when you guys enter, there's two rooms going down either side. And then there is a, there are two directly in front of you.

There are two staircases, one of which goes up sort of half a level. The other one sort of goes down half a level. The one that goes up half a level is you are informed is currently occupied by the giant Anaconda thing.

Why is it clicking?

[Heart]
Exciting news.

[James]
So that's what's going on there. Then we're going to add people. Anyone who wants to jump in.

Also, go ahead and drop yourselves down towards the bottom of the non-padded area, which I know you can't see yet. But if you look for the cone template, you'll see a spot where you can drop yourselves within the padded area. Thus employed a performance window.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, where are we supposed to be dropping ourselves?

[James]
There's only one space within the entirety of this board. It has some kind of template. Okay, discoloration.

Differently colored area from the rest of the entirety of the board.

[Speaker 4]
And to be fair, my foundry was zoomed in on the absolute wrong spot. I would zoom out. I couldn't even see it at first.

You have to remember I'm playing on mobile.

[Heart]
That's fair. Ah, yes. How is the mode bone?

[Speaker 4]
I've already found a problem. I can't put my token on the board. We encountered this last time, didn't we?

No, because I didn't get to use it last time. Although maybe somebody else did.

[James]
That's 100% false. You absolutely used your Necromancer character to do whatever it was. Did I do that on the dragon?

[Speaker 4]
No.

[James]
Dragonborn? Is it Dragonborn?

[Speaker 4]
I don't have a Dragonborn Necromancer.

[James]
I have a Tengu Cleric.

[Speaker 4]
Like, I have a Korm Kleric, but I played that on PC. This is my first time using the mobile thing. But because the computer lab is closed today because of 4th of July.

In order to see the character list, it covers the entire screen, so I don't have room to drag and drop it onto a board.

[James]
So what's the character then that you- it's clear you need me to drop a character for you. What is the character's name?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sorry. I was planning on doing Klee. Klee, however you want to say it.

I haven't even figured out how to pronounce it myself yet. The bird.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you kindly.

[James]
There we go. Everybody's on the board at this point.

[Heart]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 6]
It was delayed.

[James]
It was very delayed. Yeah, I don't think anybody else is joining at this point, so if you guys would like to- What's up?

[Landie]
I've already got a second character on the sheet.

[Heart]
I like how you just- I mean- You just toss them in the moment you hear, eh, no one else is coming, sick.

[Landie]
What does Maia do? She fills the exact same niche as Sierra, so we're still screwed as body composition.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I've got a level 1 investigator I can bring.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, hello bird.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, is it too late?

[Heart]
No, you're good.

[James]
Not too late at all. I was wondering where you were.

[Speaker 5]
I had an alarm for 6.50. My alarm off. And then I put my head back down to bed and I fell back asleep.

[James]
You should mention that. What an idiot. Nobody would ever do that.

That's not how things are described in the book.

[Landie]
I was actually nearly late because of the same reason.

[James]
It's all for you. So what I'm thinking of doing is I might run, like, I might run Friday sessions, I might run at a time that's good for, like, Euros, and probably mostly just Euros. Some Americans will get in there because they don't have jobs or whatever.

Like, earlier in the day, but then me doing sessions Saturday night for Australian time.

[Speaker 6]
So that would be like- What would that be?

[Landie]
So at night, it'd be, if you like, your morning?

[James]
It'd be my morning, and I think it'd be- So Saturday- Yeah, my Friday morning, you guys are going to sleep very shortly after that. But my Saturday- My Saturday night after work is basically when you start all your sessions for your Saturday. Well, no, I'll post the times in as well, so it's not- Yeah, I'm blank and hard, man.

No, we all just woke up.

[Landie]
Now, you said we could bring a second character before Ver was here, and I'm not letting you take that back because I need XP on both my Goobers.

[James]
Where is he?

[Speaker 6]
He's back.

[James]
Hey!

[Landie]
Um, Ver, I think I fucked up. When you said in session times that you could play on today and then next week, did you mean next week, or did you mean the upcoming week? This week.

Oh, my bad. I should have made a session. That one's on me.

[Heart]
As long as we don't get into scenarios like last time. All should be well. I also bought a Resonating Fork.

[Speaker 4]
It depends on you whether you roll that.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we need to not roll five critical failures in a row. Is it 30?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[James]
Ver's going to bring someone. Okay, cool.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, what level have we got?

[James]
Everyone but me is level one. And what I mentioned to the other folks earlier is that the easy place that people always go to to farm, like, uh, paltry amounts of gold and nothing ever good, is currently occupied by a very large snake.

[Heart]
Are we gonna get to that snake? No, we can't. We cannot.

That is a level eight snake. We will be eaten and die. It will be very embarrassing for all of us.

So we're going down. Um, but basically, everyone but me is level one, and I'm level three. So not too big of a gap.

Hmm?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's just like last time.

[Heart]
Just like last time. Yes.

[Speaker 4]
But with better rolls this time, hopefully.

[Speaker 6]
Let me just knock one good roll, Vic. Ah, Lover.

[Landie]
Okay, I have learned how to play a Swashbuckler. We're getting it.

[Speaker 4]
Hell yeah. The answer is pancakes.

[James]
As it has ever been.

[Speaker 6]
That was for the Kyle. Here we go.

[James]
Go ahead and, uh, potential barrains. These jerks. You may proceed and then immediately roll initiative.

You may place yourselves up to 10 feet within the door. Or not, sorry, not 10 feet. Uh, up to whatever your movement speed is inside.

You may move up to your movement speed.

[Landie]
Like, one turn or one action. The AOA is where we're dropping our tokens.

[Speaker 5]
No, one action.

[Landie]
Uh, I'd rather not open the door. My ass.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, session over.

[Landie]
Someone else would please go in front of me. I would very prefer it.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I can do it. I've got, I'm pretty sure I've got, like, the best armor out of all the level ones, at least.

[Speaker 6]
Don't worry, I can give you a hand. Thank you so much, dude.

[Landie]
Very kind of you, fellow. Do we have to be inside the veranda?

[Heart]
Yes, that is where the dungeon is.

[James]
Off we go. Oops, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
My apologies.

[Heart]
Oh, there's a creature. Hello.

[Speaker 6]
I guess I'll go this far up.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, ah, creatures.

[Landie]
Hello. Mrs. President, get down. Maybe E-common should come back to the door.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, all right.

[Speaker 4]
It's so funny being the only one here without a circular token. I've just got a rectangle.

[Landie]
Well, you know what they say, be there or be square.

[Heart]
How cool. And we roll initiative now, right?

[Speaker 4]
He did say roll initiative, yes.

[Heart]
Yeah.

[Landie]
We should just not do that and make James mad, and then have him instantly kill one of our characters.

[Heart]
I'm good, thank you.

[Speaker 4]
That was a horrible initiative roll.

[Heart]
It's fine. Hey, if luck provides, maybe you'd be able to level up this session. I don't know how close you are, but...

[Speaker 4]
Uh, that previous session was my first ever with this character. So, uh, not very.

[Heart]
How much XP do you have?

[Speaker 4]
260.

[Heart]
Okey-dokey, so probably a couple more. Unless we're very lucky and you get to get double.

[Landie]
Or we have a fight that gives us like a thousand and Nilly kills us and... ...uh, makes the one he plays rage quit. What you're saying is we go fight the snake.

[Heart]
Don't fight the snake. None of us can handle the snake. We will die.

It will be sad.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, everyone's level three, right?

[Heart]
No.

[Speaker 4]
There's one level three. Everyone else is level one.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Well, I'm level seven. Ben's level four.

[Heart]
Yeah, so you're the highest leveled person right now, yes.

[James]
Very good. Oh, extreme. Bradley's gonna move over.

[Speaker 6]
Can you delete Ver? What do you want me to delete?

[Speaker 5]
Can you delete Ver? I thought everyone was level three. So it's like, oh, everyone's level four.

[Heart]
Please bring Ver. I can't be the only level three... ...uh, higher than level one character. It's fine. You can bring Ver.

[James]
You guys are going down to deeper levels. Like, no, we couldn't possibly go down to deeper levels with better loot from...

[Speaker 5]
Fine. You're good. Leave me a little lower than Leon.

[James]
The objective is not just to take as long as possible.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Right.

[James]
How can it be so silly? I know I forgot this. I forgot this, but this is not papered in.

[Speaker 4]
You know, I just realized we have... Our formation is all the level ones protecting the actually high level people.

[Heart]
Good luck. Well, they are trying to assassinate me, so... We'll...

We'll be fine. Probably. I have my...

[Speaker 5]
I have a hand out there.

[Heart]
You do.

[James]
You guys burst in the door, getting ready for... ...whatever adventure may come. And the adventure comes a little faster than everybody was expecting.

The automatic... Or, sorry, the haunted piano in the corner begins playing a little tune. And we begin with one of the brownies.

Ooh! Do I have a hit? Four damage.

Do a little multi-attack.

[Landie]
Versus... Motherfucker.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh!

[James]
And... Wait, no, no. Not of the encounter.

Of the turn.

[Landie]
Instant XP.

[James]
Wait...

[Speaker 5]
What exactly is a brownie?

[Heart]
It's like a... ...spirit fey creature.

[James]
Yeah, so there are two... ...really common wild fey across the main. Mm.

The boggarts are basically more plant-like. And the brownies are a little bit more animal-like. But they're both, you know, short, stout.

They wear masks instead of faces, but they can't move from them. And the difference of the brownie is that this floating mask that makes up its head... ...is covered in, like, animal fur. Rather than, uh, kind of smoothed-out ivory. You know, river-smoothed ivory. And it has a little bit of an easier time emoting and actually speaking.

Yeah, cool. You get, they're wielding short swords. This one is also wielding a baffling glove.

Against Maia.

[Speaker 4]
No, no! And so it begins.

[Landie]
I'm gonna use a hero point on that one. That's really bad. I need success.

I am off guard against the next strike. Um, I can just drag that on. I've got that covered, thank you.

[James]
No, I got rid of the confusion. Unfortunately, that's the end of his turn.

[Landie]
It only has two actions?

[James]
No, you use one action to move.

[Landie]
Ah, so if I use one action...

[James]
Even if it's a two-action thing, you can do baffling glove. So if he moved over, he wouldn't get a chance to attack you. Bringing us to Sierra.

[Landie]
Um, am I able to step through this diagonal? Do I have to move through his square because of the wall next to me?

[James]
I think you have to move through his square because of the wall.

[Landie]
Okay, I'll do a tumble through. Uh, if I just target him with an acrobatics, I think it just queries it. Well, that sucks.

I'm gonna punch him in the face. And by punch him, I mean claw him. Miss.

We love to see it. Uh, I have an action I might as well try again. Minus one.

That's okay. That is the end of Sierra's turn. Which begins.

[James]
I've heard the hand is medium now. I don't remember that. Who did you grab you?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it is a horrifying creature, it's larger than me.

[Landie]
How long was I off guard for? Let me read that again. Uh, off guard against the next melee strike the brownie makes against it before the end of its turn.

Easy.

[James]
Yeah, so he's not going to be... My basic action macros. I don't know why they spontaneously disappeared.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was just looking at that. I'm like, oh, I was trying to do a recall roll. It's like, where is my...

[Landie]
Oh, you might have to add it again. People had been making duplicates of it, so I deleted them all.

[Speaker 6]
My bad.

[James]
Target... Okay, would you like to grab? Or uh, grab Sierra first before...

[Landie]
Oh, I'm not getting prone. Maybe Maya is cool in this campaign. Maybe it's Sierra that's not cool.

[James]
No, I'm prone, but I'm still gonna try to attack you. I'd miss.

[Landie]
Real as fuck, bro. He just goes in to grab her and Maya sweeps out his legs and he's on the ground.

[Heart]
Oh, it's my turn.

[James]
Bringing us to Kamon.

[Heart]
Woohoo, we're going to cast this thing. So that everyone gets a handy, handy, handy thing. And then, fingering composition.

Hope it works. Creature sample. Huzzah.

And then we shall attack the creature. Is this also a brownie or is it a separate? That's a chicken.

You've seen them before. Of course. We're going to see if they're weak alongside.

Like, brownies probably would be. Ahaha.

[James]
That does hit.

[Heart]
Full damage. They are.

[James]
That's two damage.

[Heart]
Splendid, that is my turn.

[James]
Bringing us to another chicken. We don't like the size, shape, or really anything else about this hand here. Oh, that's rough.

And a bitch turn. Bringing us to bear and it.

[Speaker 5]
Yay. I'd like to do a recall knowledge to determine any weaknesses.

[James]
Which will do. Target somebody and then press that sweet macro.

[Speaker 6]
Nope.

[James]
Nope, that's not how that works.

[Speaker 5]
So you have to target somebody and then. I'm targeting, I'm targeting that one. Use the basic action macro.

[Landie]
You gotta use the basic action macro.

[Speaker 5]
It's basic. I don't believe you.

[James]
It is frustrating that the one inside your character sheet does not also. Work that exact same way. Pretty sure.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, that is wrong character.

[James]
Oh, okay. Good point.

[Speaker 5]
There you go. Much better.

[James]
You're unable to glean any specific weaknesses. That you are aware that cold iron does more damage to them. From the cold iron that just slammed into him.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so it's time to attack.

[James]
Jesus. Oh, he's so dead.

[Speaker 5]
And then it's going to do a secondary attack. Yes. So he goes for the eyes.

Perfect. And. Then I guess my last action, I'll do a strike.

Missing. And that is my turn. And I go, yeah!

And I try to hit it with my animal stick.

[James]
The near death one is very, very nimble at this moment. Maya!

[Landie]
Maya is going to demoralize the brownie next to Sierra.

[James]
I didn't roll a d100. Yeah, no, that was me.

[Landie]
Um, I failed. I still get panache. Maya is going to stride.

Here. And then she's going to toss a dagger at the guy that's prone still. I didn't have my weapons drawn, never mind.

Am I allowed to have my weapons drawn, kind GM?

[James]
No, you have one weapon drawn, how about that?

[Landie]
Excellent, thank you. Um, I'm going to toss it.

[James]
Hey!

[Landie]
Ah, I didn't have finisher selected. Um, if I click that. Beautiful.

[James]
That kills him. Yeah, super dead.

[Landie]
I'm going to use little, um, red crosses, uh, orange crosses to mark where my daggers are.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Landie]
I need to pick them up after the combat. Ah, that is my turn, I think, here.

[James]
All right. Another chicken.

[Landie]
Uh, and when she demoralized this brownie, she told it to kill itself. She is a braggart swashbuckler. She specializes in demoralize.

[James]
Um, I'm just going to go for seven. I'm going to go for some quick wax first.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[Landie]
Ugh. Holy shit, Maya is cool. It's true.

[James]
It is true. Maya's not going to be waking up in handcuffs the entire game. He'd loot it.

Interesting. I see we've made a flat check and are also likely muted. What are you trying to do?

Hit someone.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, not muted, just not speaking. Not muted, just not speaking. Trying to figure out navigating this mobile thing.

[James]
What would you like to do? No, you do need to answer that.

[Speaker 4]
I would like to attack the brownie.

[James]
Okay. Are you able to open up your character sheet?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[James]
Hey, do you want me to click the damage button for you so you don't have to go? I don't know if the mobile is like blowing it up across the chat window.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, because I accidentally rotated it. Now I don't know what the chat window went.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, 14.

[James]
Very good hit. Then for your second and third actions, the brownie is currently looking injured.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, I've just completely lost my character sheet now. Because the stupid foundry rotated itself. It's not giving me the option to rotate back.

Wait, there we go, got it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
That looks weird. Nothing will be opened by the character sheet.

[James]
So what would you like to do next? You gotta keep this moving, you've had a very long time to think about this.

[Speaker 4]
Who do you want to kill? I'm just gonna attack two more times because I don't really have anything else to do. Alrighty.

I want to cast this one.

[James]
Critical miss on the second attack. Regular miss on the third attack. Alright then.

Brownie, you're up. Brownie's pissed off and at half health. We'll begin.

Time to grab my... I mean, he's not terribly impressive at this.

[Landie]
She is so cool.

[James]
Should I done trip instead? Ugh, no.

[Landie]
With that check, they fall prone either way.

[James]
Oh, shit. Yeah, do you want to grab them? Do you want to grab them and make them walk?

[Landie]
They go prone.

[James]
They go prone, alright. Well, I'm going to... You know, let's see how this first attack turns out.

Before I make any commitments... Oh, man. I guess I can't get the benefit of...

Yeah, I guess I'm not flanking you.

[Landie]
Yeah, because they're tiny.

[James]
I don't think the chink in is... Oh my god, the chink in is tiny. No, I thought he was small.

That sucks for him.

[Landie]
Everybody playing tiny creatures gets punished.

[James]
And there's so many of them. Nice.

[Landie]
Mrs. President, get down. One damage.

[James]
A mere one damage. Dang.

[Heart]
All this for a drop of blood?

[Speaker 4]
I was waiting for someone to say it. Having a rough time. Sierra.

[Landie]
Um, I'm gonna try again and hit this guy that's on the ground here. Beautiful. Holy shit, she hit.

[Speaker 6]
Woohoo!

[Landie]
Um, so I cannot sneak attack all your strength with this yet, so it's just 2d6. But it should have cold iron as a trait. Um, does it take extra damage when you apply the damage?

I just need to check it. Nice. Um, I could roll a 20, sure.

I did not roll a 20.

[Speaker 6]
I have to roll a 20.

[Landie]
Now it's my turn.

[James]
Come on!

[Heart]
Come on! Well, we're going to attack this creature. Huzzah!

Roll damage. Is it still living?

[James]
Surprisingly, yes.

[Heart]
That's unfortunate. Well, I'm going to try shooting the near-death one then. Oh, I hit it!

That is a surprise. No, he's dead. Joy.

All right, that's my turn. I'm so glad I have a bow on me. This is great.

[Speaker 6]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to run up and attack this guy. Oh, another crit! And he runs up and goes for the eyes, just moves his hand, just like fingers up to it, and just pokes it in the face and crushes it.

Oh, that's awesome. Um, is there anything else left?

[James]
Uh, there... Yeah, yeah, there's a brownie right next to Cammon, who's still alive.

[Speaker 5]
And then I look at this one.

[James]
He's been laughing increasingly loud ever since this all started.

[Speaker 5]
And let's see... You said they look phaged, not, um... Undead, right?

[James]
Very much phag.

[Speaker 5]
I recommend poison it. As I yell to it and put my hand next to its face, it goes... I, like, blow into it.

Can I please have a save?

[James]
Oh, I have a save.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[James]
Should she do? Have her switch to life.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so...

[James]
Remember, when you click roll damage, it actually prompts me to, uh, roll the save against whatever you have targeted, even if it's multiple crit.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. All right, so it says you take half initial damage and no pieces in damage, so you take two damage. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Maya!

[Landie]
Maya's gonna shout at this Jynx... Sorry, the brownie, to kill itself.

[James]
That's a hate crime.

[Speaker 4]
Good.

[Landie]
She's a hateful person.

[Speaker 4]
She's a hateful per... No! How can it be a hate crime if they love doing it?

[Landie]
Uh, she'll draw a dagger as her second action and toss it as a third. Um, it probably has, like, plus one to AC from cover from people being between them. Sorry?

[James]
That was just amusing. Maybe you stole your beer.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Oh.

[James]
Hey, that's most of his hit points.

[Heart]
Hey!

[James]
That frightened just barely gave you that critical hit.

[Landie]
I like using actions when I can.

[James]
Imagine. Very good. So the brownies fade from existence, however, they leave in their place At this point, the Charlie Brown music is going to stop playing on the piano.

Is that nearly as funny as I thought it would be? So I will be... There are plenty of other piano songs.

[Landie]
Beautiful. How much XP do we get? I need it.

[James]
That's right, let me...

[Landie]
Isn't it so nice just having the game calculate XP?

[James]
That is pretty, pretty chill, if I do say so myself.

[Heart]
Hooray. So the brownies fade away and what do they leave behind? Oh!

[Speaker 6]
Oh!

[Speaker 4]
I'm four. Okay. It's a level four, a level three, and a bunch of level ones.

[James]
So you pick a four and a three and a what?

[Heart]
A potion. All right. I'll go looking for stuff at my level.

[Speaker 5]
Invisibility potion!

[Speaker 4]
Really good choice. There's one of the other level ones, maybe one of the potion of healing. Since I can't use that because damn beer.

[Speaker 5]
There is a damn beer version of an unholy potion. It is not, it is not a level one though.

[Speaker 4]
No. Could I have? I don't think it was.

I've got a question.

[Heart]
How rare slash uncommon is this potion allowed to be?

[Speaker 4]
I don't know, it is level one. What's a potion? Wait, oh, it's not a potion, it's an oil.

[Heart]
Nevermind. Oh, that's what that was. What's a potion?

Oh, I was going to say, could I get to Draft of Stellar Radiance? But that's rare, so I don't know if I'm allowed to ask for that.

[James]
Stellar Radiance. No, I don't think so. I think you're gonna have to run.

[Heart]
Okay, I'll probably get something like... Could I get Convenant Tea? Yeah, it is.

Get what tea? Could I get, uh, Covenant Tea? Tricky Tea, if you will, but Covenant Tea.

I'm presuming. Sure. Huzzah.

Thank you very much.

[Landie]
Sorry, was there, um, was there three potions or one potion per player?

[James]
There were three potions total. You pick something of up to your level, but, um, Ver was not, that was me saying Ver cannot pick three potions. Ver cannot pick three potions.

[Heart]
Ballad.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, does someone want an invisibility potion, or do they want an improved healing potion?

[James]
If I was playing, I would totally say invisibility potion. And this is the tutorial dungeon, so I am allowed to comment in that fashion.

[Speaker 4]
But I had invisibility potion. I guess just take the invisibility potion, but I don't know what the other people want to be. I mean, I seem to be our frontline, so I don't know how invisibility would work with me, because I need to be able to be seen, to be targeted.

[Speaker 5]
Invisibility is like, if it's a wipe, you're like, yep, I'm out of here, drink a potion, flee.

[Heart]
Does this invisibility potion wear off if you attack, or is it the type where you can attack and still be invisible?

[Speaker 5]
If the target is a hostile action, the spell ends, maybe after that hostile action is completed.

[Heart]
Oh dear. Okay. Then yes, it's the...

Well, James recommended invisibility, so...

[Speaker 4]
Then I'll take invisibility, sure. Just to move things along.

[James]
Well, it's the invisibility potion's level four. Potion. Yeah, it's...

If you would like to pick a potion, there are level one potions and stuff like that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, yep, never mind. So I'll take the invisibility potion.

[Speaker 4]
I wasn't sure who you were talking to with the invisibility potion, uh...

[Landie]
For the third potion, can we have a gecko potion, please? I'll let you climb.

[Speaker 6]
Hell yeah.

[James]
Oh god. Now, are you guys able to add that into your inventory yourself, or do you want me to add that?

[Heart]
Oh, I managed.

[Landie]
If you're happy to let me have the gecko potion, I can add it in.

[James]
Yeah, yeah, no, it's... Same for a Paris invisibility potion? Yep.

[Speaker 6]
No, that's not what I want.

[Heart]
All right. You all good to start marching?

[Landie]
Do we have any way of healing, like, small amounts of health for free?

[Heart]
Uh, no.

[Landie]
Medicine!

[Speaker 4]
Let's say if we want to do our one treat wounds for the day already. What? Isn't it only once per day, treat wounds?

No.

[Speaker 5]
Once an hour. Battle medicine is once a day.

[Speaker 4]
Uh.

[Heart]
Oh, fine. So just don't get injured anytime soon. I'm fine.

I can do- use a band-aid and I'll be good.

[James]
Now a table of teas.

[Landie]
We don't have a way to heal, and I think we should just keep moving.

[Heart]
That's what I'm saying.

[Speaker 5]
If you need a bit of healing, we can do treat wounds. Otherwise, yeah.

[Landie]
I'm not missing that much. I think- I don't think kicking open the door, spending 10 minutes healing is the way to go.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that would not go well for us.

[Speaker 4]
Where do you guys intend to go next?

[Heart]
Uh, downstairs.

[Speaker 5]
Up to the piano.

[Landie]
I'm gonna destroy the piano, James.

[Heart]
Oh, it's a good piano. No, it makes such lovely music. It does nothing.

It's chill.

[Landie]
That wastes our time every session.

[James]
No, no, very fair. Very quickly, if you would like to make a check or something on the piano, you may do so.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Recall knowledge! Um, yeah, I'm pretty sure that went up there.

[James]
Cultism, uh, you may have the aid of an ancestral spirit in your next flight.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, can I steal that piano? When we leave?

[James]
That's a question for me. And, uh, all the fun consequences therein.

[Speaker 6]
Whee!

[Speaker 4]
You brought all the dead bodies with us! That surface was not mine.

[Heart]
Where? Hmm. I think you moved me through a wall, because I can't see anyone else.

[James]
I think you moved me through a wall, actually.

[Heart]
Okay. I blame you.

[Landie]
Victim blaming, love it.

[Heart]
Okay. Yes, my apologies.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, so left or right?

[Speaker 5]
Look at my stumpy left hand. Am I gonna say we go right?

[Heart]
Then right, then. Yep, we pop.

[Speaker 4]
Guess I will be the one to open the door. Are we doing exploration activities?

[Speaker 6]
Ah, yes.

[Speaker 4]
That is a great question. I mean, obviously, yes. It's just do I have it toggled on my screen?

Uh. Is anybody else gonna be scouting?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Landie]
Common already is.

[Speaker 4]
Then I will be doing the tech magic.

[Speaker 6]
Because you never know when it's gonna help.

[James]
There is, in this room, an elevator. That goes, that some of you may recall, goes down to the third floor.

[Heart]
Oh, fun. Who wants a trip to the lower floors?

[James]
To the domain of the Nixies.

[Heart]
We are not going to the lower floors. I forgot that was what was on it.

[Speaker 4]
Immediately changed his mind.

[Heart]
That's fun. Want to explore the rest of this room first? Would you guys like to explore the Nixie lair?

[Landie]
You can explore up here if you'd like.

[Heart]
I would very much like that, dear Maia. I would very much like that, Maia. Right.

[Speaker 5]
Does anyone know what a Nixie is? It's a fairy.

[Heart]
Oh, it's a water fairy. They tend to be quite temperamental. But I am attempting to help one with her rise to nobility to get some sort of deal.

So far, though, these ones have tried to assassinate me. More than once. It's alright.

[Speaker 6]
So, hopefully- They can try to assassinate you?

[Heart]
Such is the way of being handsome. Such is life. What, is there anything in this room?

[James]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, fun.

[James]
I will invite everybody to add themselves to initiative.

[Heart]
Sighs heavily. Yay!

[Speaker 4]
Yay!

[Heart]
Yes, on one hand, yippee, on the other hand, ow, ow, ow.

[Speaker 5]
This is how we die.

[Heart]
Yippee!

[Speaker 4]
Hey, I got a better initial roll this time.

[Speaker 6]
And...

[James]
Oh, neat, there's a hazard to this one.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[James]
Time is a flat circle.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, oops.

[James]
I jumped into this one.

[Heart]
Ah. Oh, the giant frogs are back. That's delightful.

[James]
Here they are. It means, really, what I need to do- One of these guys needs to roll a d100. Percentile dice, it did say.

Okay, so the spear frogs are in a moment of panic and not happy and currently bracing themselves against the door. However, they are not attempting to attack you.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's nice.

[James]
They're bracing themselves against the door and currently dealing with triggers.

[Heart]
Ah, these are... Okay. Right.

So, I shall... We can try to disable them, since they're not trying to attack us, per se. That's good.

The hazards are the shriekers, right?

[James]
That's correct.

[Heart]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
There's the shrieker right next to caiman.

[James]
Yes. And so there is. My, uh...

[Speaker 6]
Excellent move.

[James]
Oh, why are you muted?

[Landie]
Whoops, my bad. I am muted. She's going to stride back into this room.

Do I trigger a trap stepping into the elevator room, or is it good?

[James]
No, it's good.

[Landie]
Um... Well, the frog's hostile. They sort of just seem confused.

[James]
No, they're not hostile. They are...

[Landie]
So they're just blocking...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[James]
Yeah, they have like little spear frogs on top of them. They're riding them around.

[Landie]
Maya's so confused. I think she just will end her turn seeing this. I don't know if I should attack or not, and I can't delay now, because I moved, so...

[Speaker 6]
You can disable the shriekers.

[James]
The spear frog is not like a... It's not like a grung, or like a frog person. They are riding them around like horses, but it's just a smaller frog.

[Landie]
I'll do a recall knowledge actually on the shriekers to identify them. Um...

[James]
Two demoralized actions from Nova, thank you.

[Landie]
My bad. The hotbar does not work well for me. Um...

I think I did that correctly.

[Speaker 6]
Hey!

[James]
So you know that they have immunities to critical hits and like precision damage?

[Landie]
Uh... Maya would like to learn, sorry, what check to disable them.

[James]
To disable them, you can make a DC 18 survival check to carefully approach and cut the mushroom's air sac without triggering it.

[Landie]
She's going to use her last action to tell that to the party. And we'll end her turn. Um...

She does not have survival train though, so she's not trying to do that.

[Heart]
I- I'm right here by the shrieker, so... Yes, I kind of have to. I'll try my hand at it.

If we fail, we fail. One survival. Oh my god, let's go.

[James]
Pretty good. However, I do need you to make this first.

[Heart]
That's fine.

[James]
Pretty good. And also this. Hey!

Very good. All right, so you only take like half damage on the first one.

[Heart]
Oh, cool.

[James]
There you go.

[Heart]
You want to know something very funny? No, I- that's what I did. I take no damage.

I bought a resonating bow for this session.

[James]
Oh, shit. What is that? Resistance?

That's pretty cool.

[Heart]
All right, so I disabled the one next to me.

[James]
Flaming Star Hunter's Bow. That thing looks like... That looks fucking sick, actually.

[Heart]
I didn't buy the hunter's bow. That was treasure.

[James]
I can't remember the last time I've seen it. It's fucking- it's really cool though. All right, so this one is successfully disabled.

So I'm going to mark it as defeated.

[Heart]
Okie dokie. Would I be able to go and disable this one as well? You do still have an action.

Sweet, I will do that. I forget. Let me just move out from under that.

[James]
I said there's a track.

[Landie]
Do the frogs get hurt by the Shriekers?

[James]
They do. Oh, why did I do that?

[Heart]
I did fail that survival check.

[Landie]
They can't detonate again, so...

[Heart]
Oh, thank goodness. Okay. I thought they just could keep doing it.

[Landie]
Ah, the bottom frog would not be in range of the top two Shriekers. Invisible frogs, huh? Those bastards.

[Speaker 5]
He's making the overflow picture real. There's this whole stack of them.

[James]
I rolled a natural one. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no. Oh yeah.

[James]
Wait, nope. Undo that. He just took normal damage.

Spear frog. Takes double. Okay, they're still alive.

Neat. This giant frog is being commanded by this other giant frog. By this other...

By the spear frog. Uh, Ki, you're gonna be up in a moment here.

[Speaker 4]
All righty. Oh, they're immune to crits!

[James]
No! Second Shrieker up top is dead. That's gonna be their turn.

Now the frog here is going to delay until after... Until after Ki, feeling nervous as it is.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[James]
He's gonna delay until like the end of it. End of the round. Where's the Ki?

[Speaker 4]
So we are disabling some mushroom crap thing, huh? That is correct. Oh, if I could be allowed to move my finger, that'd be great.

Soundray, why are you being like this? Let me target my token, please. Come on.

Target my f***ing token. Oh, there. It's not caught.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's so... God, this is a pain in the ass.

[James]
Let me know what you're trying to do here.

[Speaker 4]
I want to try and move into the room.

[James]
Which room?

[Speaker 4]
With all the mushroom creatures. Well, with all the Shriekers in it.

[James]
Hey, all right. I'm gonna move you to the threshold of the door so you don't immediately proc it. You do have another five feet of movement, meaning that you could walk in and get within ten feet of the Shrieker.

[Speaker 4]
So this bottom one hasn't been activated yet at all? That's correct. Okay.

Is there something I can roll to not trigger it when I walk up, or...? Yeah, you can make a survival check to disable... Uh-huh, that's fine. I think you need to trigger it.

Why would I want to trigger it? I don't have any sonic damage. But it hits the froggies.

[James]
Yeah, I want it to hit the froggies.

[Heart]
Are you...? The frogs are nice. The frogs are nice. I mean, it's up to you.

[Speaker 4]
I would rather not antagonize the frogs for no reason, and survival is my divine skill anyway, so I'm, like, decently good at it. So, uh, yeah, I will roll survival to try and disarm it. Here we go.

Uh, I would like to use a hero point to re-roll that. I don't know how to... I don't know how to do that on this, so...

If I can...

[James]
Uh... I got you.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, I do not have the option to do that on mobile. There we go!

[James]
Hey, that's much better. You do successfully disable it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, and, uh, that... So that takes two actions to disable it?

[James]
Yep, they are gone now. But you guys can decide to attack the frogs instead. I mean, if they're not attacked...

[Speaker 4]
Jumping, but...

[James]
It's up to you guys.

[Heart]
They're chill. As long as they don't, um, I guess, stab us in the back, so to speak. I think that it's all right.

We can have frog buddies.

[James]
I agree. Remove them as participants, because we're throwing off the XP.

[Landie]
We should get XP for dealing with them anyway.

[James]
I'm going to give you a little bit of bonus XP, because you protected them.

[Landie]
Circumventing a fight gives full XP, typically.

[James]
Yeah. Well, this isn't circumventing a fight.

[Landie]
Yeah, no, I get that.

[James]
I'm going to walk through the city and not kill anybody.

[Landie]
Give me XP!

[Heart]
Thousands and thousands of spared.

[Landie]
No, I completely get what you're meaning, Lou.

[Speaker 5]
We start a fight with them, and then we let them live.

[James]
Yeah, no, I am going to give you extra XP for stock.

[Landie]
Yeah, I'd give like 20 or 30 XP for that.

[James]
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

[Landie]
Which honestly is pretty high for bonus XP for not really doing anything, but otherwise it just takes forever to level up.

[James]
I've gotten them killed, or gotten these new allies killed. I'm like happy to reward it. More broadly though, there's treasure that they're guarding.

You know, the Shriekers were guarding, which it's now my turn to appear. Whatever was banging on the door has at the top of stock.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Landie]
Can anyone speak to frogs? Yes.

[Heart]
Alas, I cannot.

[James]
Speaking of which, one of the frogs coughs up a fungus.

[Heart]
Oh boy.

[James]
Several little fungus motes that smell quite nice.

[Speaker 5]
Do they look sick?

[Heart]
Oh, I'm going to just take a healthy step away from the coughing frog.

[James]
You rolled with it, V2. Sorry. You rolled with it, V2.

Hey! No, these are... Sorry, these are communion spores.

[Heart]
Oh!

[James]
You can eat them to gain a little bit of telepathic understanding of with other creatures nearby who've eaten them, which is why these frogs are currently working together.

[Speaker 4]
I assume that coughing it up means that the frogs want to speak to us? Or is it just giving us the mushrooms?

[Heart]
I imagine they would like to speak to us. She winces slightly at the fact she's going to have to eat frog mushroom and takes one.

[Speaker 4]
I guess he will eat one as well.

[Landie]
Maya's going to commune with the frogs and eat a spore as well.

[James]
You get a sensation or a feeling of thank you for the food.

[Heart]
You're welcome.

[James]
We like the hard... We like the soft shell around the shiny bits.

[Heart]
I see. Well... What was...

Do you know what the banging was from upstairs? I'm glad you can enjoy the food here. Oh.

Well, I'm glad we could help you, you know. What was... Yes, what was the banging?

[James]
How the fuck do I get rid of this? Not far. It's like, wait, oh my...

Hey! I can slide it around.

[Speaker 6]
No!

[James]
Bastard. Giant centipedes.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[James]
And giant swarms of normal-sized centipedes.

[Heart]
Ah, I see. That is dreadfully unpleasant. Well, I'm fairly well equipped to deal with those.

[Speaker 4]
Send a key in and let them cast a three-action harm. Problem solved. Although the banging stopped, so maybe they're gone.

[Heart]
Perhaps. Would you like to go check them out?

[Speaker 6]
Sure.

[James]
Everybody may add... Yeah. Everybody may add another cure point.

In fact, everybody may add a cure point for talking with the... Saving the frogs and then speaking with them.

[Speaker 6]
Hooray!

[Speaker 4]
I shall... Anyway, I shall walk up to the upper door and...

[James]
Oh, we're not jumping.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. But I didn't say I opened it yet. I just...

I was walking up to it. I was gonna wait for the rest of the party to come over before I opened it.

[Speaker 5]
That's what they all say.

[James]
Wait, uh, take a... 10-minute break, so... Because I'm probably gonna need to run to the restroom in a moment.

Okie dokie. I am gonna have to run to the restroom in a moment. Ah, yes.

My favorite.

[Speaker 6]
Let's see...

[James]
Landy, do you know if there's a way to find, like, individual runes on the compendium browser?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, for which ones? Like, items? Any...

Runes. Like, uh... No, like a striking rune.

Like, magical, like, yeah. Uh, in... Just the link there.

So there's different kinds. So you have the fundamental runes.

[James]
And then you have the... I'll figure it out. I'm trying to figure out whether I can find them...

Whether I can have, like, a thing of them on Foundry. It seems like I cannot. But that feels weird.

[Heart]
Sorry, what are you looking for, exactly?

[James]
Uh, property runes. Like, strike... Strike fundamental runes.

Striking, potency, stuff like that.

[Heart]
Oh, if you go into... Uh, the compendium browser, in equipment, and you type in rune, it should pop up.

[James]
So it's in equipment. Should have a filter front.

[Heart]
Let me screenshot what I mean.

[James]
So you see, like, reinforcing rune. Uh, stuff like that. But that doesn't have...

[Speaker 6]
Ah, I see.

[James]
Reinforcing rune is good. I see rune stone.

[Heart]
Oh, I see what you mean.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. If you know the names of the runes, shut up.

[James]
Landy, if I wanted to make a table of, like, existing runes, are there any... Is there any way to find the fucking runes in...

[Landie]
Well, no. Um, you would have to search them by name. Uh, I don't think they have the subcategory of runes in the foundry.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, why did I do that?

[James]
Oh, well, certainly not as items. Not as abilities, either.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like, uh, before we start, to... Can I take a minute to swap out my companions?

[James]
Uh, it doesn't look like it's getting fixed anytime soon. Oh, well. I'm gonna have to manually copy this over.

Just gonna take the ages. Oh, yes, everything has been added. Everything has been added to the loot.

Amazing chest. So I'm gonna drop the amazing chest on top of you.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Landie]
Instantly crushed by the damage of it making you character.

[James]
There's a six-pointed star.

[Heart]
Oh, fun.

[Speaker 6]
That is a lot of copper.

[Landie]
I'm pretty sure the potty stash should be empty, so I'm gonna remove all the gold from it, at least.

[Heart]
Oh, right, Ver. There is a cheese elixir for you in the party. Saved it.

[Speaker 5]
That's racist. I love it.

[Heart]
But you take it anyway.

[James]
We got you a free Escalade. That's very racist, but thank you.

[Landie]
Incredibly funny response to that. I love it.

[Heart]
Okay, we can put the rest of the things in the stash. Oh, did someone take the arrows?

[Landie]
Whoops, I might have deleted them. My bad. I think it was 80 arrows.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wow, that is a lot of copper. You know what I was talking about, man? The copper, I was like, how much is it?

2,000. Wait, that's a lot of what? There's five here.

Copper. No, I said the copper.

[Landie]
James's plan is to give us so much copper we can't leave the dungeon.

[Heart]
Anyway, I'll move this stuff to the party chest, and then we can divide it from there.

[Landie]
Is there anyone that can cast Shock and Grasp?

[Speaker 4]
Nope.

[Landie]
The only thing that I'm interested in is the Oil of Skating, but I assume everybody is.

[Heart]
No, I'm good.

[Speaker 5]
I'll take the Aeon Stone so I can enchant it later on.

[Heart]
You're taking which one?

[Speaker 5]
I'll take the Aeon Stone so I can enchant it.

[Heart]
Okie dokie.

[Landie]
Um, I'll just keep Tabs of... I'm gonna give the Skating potion to Maya, and I'll deduct five gold or whatever from my cut of any money that we get at the end.

[Heart]
Does anyone use arrows?

[Landie]
Ciara does, but she's in a punching mood today, so... Well, ideally she doesn't. When she reaches level two, she won't, so...

[Heart]
Won't use arrows?

[Landie]
No. She will be punching and kicking.

[Heart]
We can just keep it there for now. Does anyone want the Warblood Mutagen?

[Landie]
It's a... I think it'd be good on the Cleric, honestly.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Heart]
Alright, please feel free to take the Warblood Mutagen from the party sheet.

[Speaker 4]
I would if I knew how to do that on the mobile thing.

[Heart]
Alright, I can give it to you. Give me a sec. Thank you, I appreciate it.

You are most welcome. First I have to put it in my inventory, then I can put it in your inventory. Give me a good second.

Here we go. Here you go.

[Speaker 5]
How long does it take to invest? That went to Jacob.

[Heart]
I gave it to the wrong person. I gave it to the wrong person. Ignore me.

Please can you give it to...

[Landie]
It'd be easiest for James to do it at this point. James, can you please open...

[Heart]
I accidentally gave it to the wrong person.

[Landie]
I need you to open Jacob, the new companion that Ver has dragged out their sheet, and take the Mutagen that Heart has just given them and give that to Key the Get.

[Heart]
Ah, there we go.

[Speaker 4]
That's the wrong person.

[Heart]
Motherfucker!

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so it's not just me.

[James]
The entire game was based on words, by the way.

[Speaker 6]
I have done it now.

[Landie]
Sorry, James.

[Heart]
Alright, so they're arrows, Thunderbird Tuft and the Antler Arrow. And, well, 2000 copper pieces.

[Landie]
My vote for the Antler Arrows is to sell them, because I like money.

[Heart]
Yes, same. Alright, fair enough.

[Speaker 4]
I am very close to getting my Rune of Striking, so I would quite like money.

[Heart]
Nice. Well, we can sell that for arrows. I know a character that can use Shocking Grasp, so I could just take that for them.

Is that alright?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, we haven't claimed anything yet. Okay.

[Landie]
If you claim the taffs, then we're all pretty even for loot still. So we can just divide up money as normal.

[Heart]
Nice. Alright, on we go, then. Do we want to fight the Centipedes or explore other parts of the dungeon?

Thank you for the amazing chest, James.

[Landie]
Oh, fuck. Sierra's here. Um, hang on.

How many of the arrows does she get to take to even up loot? One. Perfect.

Best. I have one Antler Arrow. Yes, let's go.

[Heart]
Uh, let me do my- There are Centipedes past here, so would you guys like to get ready before we fight Centipedes?

[Landie]
That sounds good to me.

[Heart]
Splendid.

[Speaker 4]
If you don't mind doing a little bit of tactics, you could- we could just send Key in there to do a three-action harm and have someone close the door behind him so no one else gets hit.

[Landie]
And then everyone- Oh, I can get hit by that.

[Heart]
Oh, that's so funny. Alright. Oh, let's go Void Killing, buddy.

[Landie]
I'm like, yes, I- I'm not affected by negative magic that heals me. Well, some harm at least. You could probably kill me with Powerled Kill.

[Heart]
Are you also a Dampier?

[Landie]
Yes, I am.

[Heart]
Oh. You should talk to Klomp. Alright.

So, do you want- we- we can just launch you and cast harm, close the door behind you, but we don't know how powerful all of these Centipedes are, so that might not be wise.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, they said there was a large- a couple of large ones and small ones. How big may they be?

[Landie]
If you follow in soon after, I'm sure it will be fine.

[Heart]
Alright, well, let's get ready then. If I released, please bring out any weapons you want, and I will just- There you go.

[Landie]
Can we enter initiative now?

[Speaker 6]
Sure.

[Landie]
Or like, as the door gets opened, maybe?

[James]
We could totally choose to enter initiative now. Sure.

[Landie]
Because we can organize our actions so that we- I said yes!

[James]
Do it! Jesus!

[Speaker 6]
Fine!

[James]
No, I'm kidding, I'm messing with you. You're fine. You're fine.

[Landie]
Someone outside the room will have to shut the door once we're in with like a reaction or something would be the best way.

[Speaker 6]
Um.

[Landie]
Can we move the frogs and the trap tokens out of the way?

[James]
No, they don't want to be- They don't want to be in here.

[Landie]
Okay, Sierra can open the door with her first action. She can then use two actions to use her reaction to shut the door once Maya and Ki are in. Um.

I think Ki should go second and move in, and Maya third, and then what would Carmen and Ver like to do while the harm goes off? I have AoE.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, so.

[Heart]
I have- We have area of effect or long distance stuff, so we don't have to be inside.

[Landie]
So after Ki casts harm, do you want to go in then? I guess Ki could just step around the corner and we don't shut the door. Let's do that, let's do that.

Um.

[Speaker 5]
I'll cover that swarm with my own swarm!

[Speaker 4]
I'm also realizing, I've really learned a flaw on this planet, that it's going to take two rounds to do this, but I have to move into the room first and then do the three action harm.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We open the door and then we shove him in.

[Speaker 4]
That's why I say, yeah, I mean I could choose to fail the athletics check to be shoved.

[Landie]
I like that. Let's shove you- We'll have Maya shove you twice. Are we allowed to start combat?

[James]
Yes. Oh, I didn't roll the dice.

[Landie]
Are we allowed to delay after enemies we can't see?

[James]
Yeah, that's totally fine.

[Landie]
I would like to go after the enemies, if that makes sense, because we're aware of their presence. Um. Do you want us all to delay our turns, or do you just want to drag their initiatives to above ours?

[James]
Well, they're just going to delay until after you then.

[Heart]
Yeah, that makes sense.

[Speaker 6]
Just perpetually delay.

[Speaker 4]
If we delay long enough, maybe we'll- Who's going to open the door?

[Landie]
Sierra is going to open the door. She is going first, out of us.

[James]
Okay. So they are going to delay.

[Landie]
Okay.

[James]
Until after Sierra.

[Landie]
Dorephans, you might be getting hit.

[James]
It's fine, I thought- Damn it. Oh my god, how hard is it to understand that I won? So if I drag it below you- No, it doesn't register as dragging it below you.

It's like, oh no, it's actually below. Did you drag it above him, I think, and then I put it below? We are- Well, here's the- But it's not registering.

We are deporting Atropos to, uh- I have no idea. He's probably just a regular American citizen, but we're sending him to Antarctica at this point.

[Speaker 6]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 5]
Sierra. If I- If I give my minion- An item, can he throw it?

[Speaker 4]
There is a fee for that, for it to be able to do that. You have to have that on the thing.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know if that's for companions.

[Speaker 5]
Dorephanelia is a companion.

[Landie]
I don't know if he has manual- Like, I don't know if- I genuinely don't know the answer to that, sorry.

[James]
I am interested in finding out.

[Landie]
I assume he can throw it. Um, I don't see why he couldn't.

[James]
Can we do a quick Google search and see if anything comes up immediately?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, wow, those are some giant-ass pizza.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, yes. In Pathfinder, a companion with arms can throw a potion, but only if they have the ability to do so. If they have the ability to do so.

If they have the ability to do so. Oh, hell yeah. Quickly.

If the companion has the ability to do so.

[James]
You are breaking up. You're robotting.

[Speaker 4]
Robotting. Yeah. I cannot understand a word you are saying.

[Landie]
For Sierra's last two actions, I'm gonna use the ready action, which lets me set a trigger for a one-action manipulate. I'm going to shut the door when Key is ready to cast harm.

[James]
Yeah, that was reasonable.

[Landie]
Now we have, like, four centipedes turns, and they all walk up and kill him before he gets to it.

[Speaker 6]
It's so funny. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, given the way this room is laid out, I don't think we were ever going to be able to walk into this room with all these centipedes.

[Landie]
I still think it's worth hitting us all with harm, honestly.

[Speaker 5]
No, move out of the way, and I'll go there.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, yeah, I can't, I mean, now the plan can be that I just delay until y'all are all out of the room. Y'all can just walk out into the previous room, and then I cast harm. Everyone except for the other person with void healing, anyway.

[James]
What's your movement, buddy?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, emeron, then. I forgot, they're swarms, they can just do that, can't they?

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Landie]
It's a strange situation to have, like, a standoff both sides of the door, because they're both ready for...

[Speaker 6]
The creature eyes.

[James]
I'm making some saving throws. Jacob. Jacob!

[Speaker 5]
Uh, Jacob, Jacob, it's me.

[James]
He's, he's succeeded. Well, you re-rolled it using a hero point, but he already succeeded.

[Speaker 5]
No, no, Jacob and Ver are two different people.

[Speaker 6]
What?

[James]
I said, Jacob already succeeded, I don't, and then I saw the hero point symbol pop up for it.

[Speaker 5]
I did a hero point for Ver. Okay.

[Landie]
Hand us our damage.

[James]
So, everybody except for Carmen takes... Then you also need to make saves, versus the centipede swarm banner. How's the blood?

Skeleton is probably fine. I hope.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's going to work. I believe.

[James]
I'm doing it again. Of course.

[Speaker 6]
For real.

[Speaker 5]
Enjoy.

[Landie]
Uh, no, I might have already used a hero point.

[Speaker 5]
But we got one, just, we had a second one not later.

[Landie]
Oh, did we?

[James]
We probably should have too.

[Landie]
Um, it was like, not much damage. Yeah, I might be taking double of two.

[Speaker 5]
So if I crit success...

[Landie]
You take no damage.

[James]
So do I go to like, stage two?

[Landie]
Um, so a second exposure to the poison will um, put us to stage two on a fail. Uh, Ver, on a uh, success will not take any damage and will be cured. I'm gonna use my hero point on the poison.

Um, sad. So now everyone that's failed twice will go to stage two. And uh, we'll roll out checks for stage three, um, at the start of its turn.

[James]
Yes, it is the end of its turn. My, my, my.

[Heart]
There are so many bugs.

[Landie]
Palm's gonna obliterate these guys.

[Speaker 4]
It's gonna be rough.

[Landie]
We just have to get there.

[Speaker 4]
Unfortunately my initiative rolls have been terrible, even though I'm a wisdom class and should have good initiative.

[Heart]
We'll just have to move out of the way so that harm doesn't hit us too.

[James]
Basic damage. Then we do it again.

[Speaker 4]
I am going to die before I get the chance to take my turn. Oh, nevermind, I can roll, but I'll save.

[Landie]
You don't even need to roll the fort save.

[Speaker 6]
So it's just the...

[Landie]
Because you don't take damage, yeah. Um, so I'll take my two, but I succeeded on the fort so I don't need to do the poison. Our frontline doing a little better than the backline.

Can I even shut the door while a swarm of centipedes is in it?

[Speaker 4]
No, because it's not a... We don't need to close the door anymore because they're not even in there.

[Landie]
Is he crawling around on the walls? It's freaky.

[Speaker 4]
We just need the non-void-killing people to vacate the room, and then I'm going to cast the harm.

[Speaker 5]
Because at least it'll heal me. If I miss, does it still do the splash damage?

[Landie]
To it.

[Speaker 5]
But nothing?

[Landie]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'm going to try it.

[Landie]
It's under the splash trait.

[Speaker 5]
Reroll using hair plate.

[James]
Yeah! What the, what's going on there?

[Speaker 6]
Oh. It's not your turn yet.

[James]
Disconnect and reconnect.

[Speaker 6]
Ah. All right.

[James]
Try talking, because now you're talking.

[Speaker 5]
All right, I'm gonna throw an alchemist fire at the big one, and then it's gonna splash everyone besides me and... Kayman.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have good reflex saves, why would you do this to me?

[Speaker 5]
That's not a reflex save. You just take two damage.

[Speaker 6]
Two fire damage.

[Speaker 5]
But then so does, like, everyone else.

[Speaker 4]
Including the minion. Oh, I'm on two HP now. Wait, have I been damaged yet, or did you just kill me?

[Landie]
I think he's just killed you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, did you not already take the damage? Uh, unless you, if you haven't applied it yet, I have not.

[Heart]
Uh, it had applied to you.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, great, then I'm on two health. So, uh, I kind of have to cast harm now, or else I die. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
And then I'm gonna move over here. I kind of want to move where this giant frog is, but...

[Heart]
You can move after the... Yeah.

[James]
Giant frog is, uh, I'll be fine. Moist.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so it's still alive? Okay, all right, then I move down here. And then I'm gonna target that one.

Surprisingly, yes. I don't think it shouldn't be. Critically missing.

[James]
That splash damage beat the fuck out of the other sword, too.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. And that is my turn.

[Landie]
Maya's just gonna delay it off to Ki.

[Heart]
Uh, shouldn't you be... Wait, sorry, is it Maya that's the damper?

[Landie]
Yeah, Maya's undead. She's fine.

[Heart]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, sorry everyone else who's in this room with me, I am... I'm casting a 3-actor sword.

[Heart]
Could you theoretically delay your turn after me so I don't, um, get continent? All right, fair enough.

[Speaker 4]
Are you after me? If you're immediately after me, I get you. Okay, then I will delay until after you.

[Heart]
Cool, thanks.

[Speaker 4]
It's just the other person who's at the top of initiative, I can't delay until after, because if I do...

[Landie]
That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
No, I'd be immediately after, so I can delay after that character. I forgot how delay works.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, James, could you move me up there? Because I was, yeah... By the stick.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Can you move me up there? Sorry. I will...

Okay, so yeah, I'm delaying until right before the center phases, but is what I should be saying here.

[James]
Do you delay until the top of the initiative?

[Speaker 4]
No. Oh, Felga, never mind. Well, you just delay until you're the last person.

Yeah.

[James]
Yeah, you just delay... All right, so comment first. Okay.

[Heart]
I'm going to heal you slightly, lest you perish.

[Speaker 6]
You can take soothe.

[Heart]
You can take soothe, yes?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, soothe is not vitality. It is like one of the only... You soothed yourself instead of me.

[Heart]
Oh my god. Ignore that. Here we go.

I'm targeting you now, so it should... Please heal yourself.

[Speaker 4]
Yay! That's like my entire health bar back. God bless.

[Heart]
You are most welcome. And then with my last action, I'm going to move you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, that's right. Oh yeah, it does help if I hit the button, doesn't it? If it'll let me...

There we go.

[Heart]
Cool. Let me leave, please.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, get out. Who closed it? Who closed the door?

[Heart]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Now the door needs to be closed. Yeah, you need to be around the corner. Sure, why not?

[Heart]
I shut it behind me.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't want you to be... Unless you want to get hit with the emanation, that door needs to be closed. Hurry, action, harm.

Let's go. Cool.

[James]
Actually, if you just cast a spell, I can drop the targets. Place 30 foot emanation. Easy.

[Speaker 6]
What the fuck? No!

[Speaker 4]
What? Wait, what? What?

Is there a frog that isn't going to hit? What?

[James]
No, there's not a frog.

[Speaker 4]
I thought the door was closed.

[Landie]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know why it's saying it will hit it when the door is closed. The emanation shouldn't go through a closed door. It's not.

[Landie]
No one closed the door.

[Speaker 4]
Somebody did close the door.

[James]
Hold on. The door is very clearly closed.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so I don't get why the emanation is saying it'll go through the door.

[Landie]
No one's got the action to close it. Someone keeps clicking the door, leave it open.

[Speaker 5]
Not me. My mouse is over here.

[James]
Wait, why are we opening the door? I don't understand.

[Landie]
Nobody shut the door.

[James]
Cameron shut the door.

[Landie]
She spent her actions casting a spell and then moving. She did not shut the door.

[James]
Good point. Good point. Unfortunate, Mr. Frog.

[Speaker 4]
Well, potentially it was Savage Frog.

[James]
Why am I offline?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right, because I got nothing in my space.

[James]
Hold on. Do the fucking... Click the damage button.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I didn't know you were waiting for me to do that. I don't even have a damage button available. Oh, wait, there it is.

[Landie]
It was hiding from me.

[Speaker 4]
All right, nobody else...

[James]
Don't click any saves.

[Landie]
It's just you guys that have to save.

[Speaker 4]
All right, sweet.

[Landie]
Yeah, I... If they all crit succeed, I'm going to cry.

[Speaker 5]
Does it give me the option to heal?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, and of course, you get crit success.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, the frog! I said no, the frog crit succeeded. Yay, let's go, frog!

Yay, congrats, frog. I mean, at least one thing crit failed. That's something.

[Landie]
This... The swarm failed, so it'll take weakness damage too.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Landie]
Sorry, the swarm succeeded, so it will take weakness damage.

[James]
It did still take its, um... It did still take its weakness damage, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
That was not nearly as effective as I was hoping it would be. I mean, I guess that's what I get for being a battle priest instead of a...

[James]
Priest didn't kill everything instantly. It's a creature three, but... Just took them both down to...

[Landie]
Very bad.

[Speaker 5]
Um, do we get a heal from that if we have void healing?

[Landie]
Yes, if you're in Jacob, well, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, um, where do I roll for the healing?

[James]
No, just right-click it. You were not in, um... You hit from it.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, oh, Jacob!

[Speaker 6]
Yeah!

[Landie]
You just, um, press the plus near the damage fall, and then there's an option to heal when you've got Jacob selected. Yep, sweet.

[James]
Um... Did the same thing for Maia? I already...

[Landie]
Yeah, I did that. Okay, now it's Maia's turn. She's gonna attack the swarm, uh, that's under Sierra and, uh, Iki.

That's a terrible idea. I have nothing better to do, though. I will...

I'll demoralize the swarm. Haha.

[Heart]
You have too many legs. Shame. Shame.

It worked!

[Landie]
Um, I'll do my... finish our guess and leave the room. Miss, that's fine.

She's getting out of here with her last action. Uh, which then takes us to Sierra's turn. It does.

It is very hurt. She will. Um, you don't have to tumble through a swarm, you can just leave.

She'll attack at the swarm underneath her and then probably leave as well. Terrible. Hit!

Slashing, very effective against a swarm, I'm sure.

[James]
I mean, it's pretty close to death.

[Landie]
No, there's no way I hit it twice. Uh, last action stride. Is that too far?

Hang on. Nah, we're good.

[Speaker 5]
I feel bad that Jacob's... I mean, not Jacob, but uh... I think Q is left out there all by himself.

Jacob's fine.

[Landie]
He's just fine. He's good.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, so long as I don't die, I get to drop another three-action armor, which surely this time will work. Surely. With my, like, DC 15 save, because I only got plus two wins.

[Heart]
Hey, listen, you did get healed up to full, you'll be a-okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, definitely. Except the fact that these things do reflex saves instead of AC, which I'm terribly bad at.

[Landie]
The swarms don't want to target each other.

[Heart]
I will say, you are outside my sight right now, so I cannot help you.

[James]
The swarms don't want to target each other, but it's, um, I can do three actions now, swarming, but...

[Landie]
Nah, Q's got this. Um, this was the swarm that bit Maya, so she would have... Is it?

No. We'll need to do our poison checks, um, soon. Just a reminder.

[James]
I think it's Kamen.

[Landie]
Sierra's fine. I think it's Maya and Kamen that are still poisoned. That'll be after this giant centipede goes, though.

Sorry. Nice.

[James]
Look, you're a damage buff.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, there's half my HP immediately. Well, I rolled all one and twos for everybody else, and for me it always rolled eight sixes and eights for damage.

[Speaker 6]
It's like, alright.

[Landie]
Let's go.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I actually am pleased. And then there's the part where I die. Yep, it's another fail.

And wants to do another eight damage. Nope, it's... It just does not roll low for me, does it?

[Speaker 6]
Let's go.

[James]
Another reflex!

[Speaker 6]
Hey!

[James]
Let's go. We take half. This is what that means.

[Speaker 4]
Let's go. I'm still alive and there's still three more centipedes left to go.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, bad luck.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, come on! And I'm pretty sure I'm down from that.

[Landie]
Good effort, though.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, that was exactly... That was exactly 16 damage. I'm down.

You are? Yep, that was exactly my entire health bar. I have 16 HP.

I am number one. No other targets available. Yeah.

[James]
Yeah, at the start of this one, we need Kaman. And whoever else is poison.

[Landie]
There's Maia. If you can just ping the save again. Oh, you're gonna target us.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. And also, don't forget to give me the diamond.

[Landie]
So Kaman goes down two stages. Maia goes up one stage. So I think stage one is still damage, right?

[James]
So everyone still has damage, yeah. Oh, Kaman, don't click that.

[Heart]
Oh, don't?

[James]
Don't. It's my bad. It's only for Maia.

Also, off guard for one round. Are you?

[Landie]
Am I clumsy still?

[James]
There's this.

[Heart]
Oh. Ow.

[Landie]
Sorry, am I clumsy still?

[James]
Uh, only for one round. You shouldn't still be proctecting.

[Landie]
Just off guard, thanks. All right, Jacob will solo. I have faith.

All of those minions are all crazy, honestly.

[James]
All right. I can't look in. I'm gonna have to go against Jacob.

But the other one is going to. All right. So while I attack Jacob.

[Speaker 5]
It's all good to me.

[James]
Hey, who is fucking talking right now at this moment? Stop doing that.

[Speaker 5]
I'm saying, can you kick me, please?

[James]
What?

[Speaker 4]
Can you kick me? Can I?

[Landie]
Oh, Ver can't see the game.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[James]
Just a sec.

[Speaker 5]
I'm hearing all this Jacob stuff and I disconnected. I'm like, no.

[James]
Okay. I'm gonna attack Jacob. In the meantime, I need a brief.

Refresher on the dying moves. Because we're about to use them.

[Landie]
So when you become dying, your initiative changes to before the creature that put you down. On your turn, you're all dying.

[Speaker 6]
So I have checked.

[James]
And for taking damage.

[Landie]
Uh, I believe if you take damage from a, um, a non-critical source, it is one level of dying. And if you crit fail or you're critically hit, I believe it's two.

[James]
And then when do you actually die?

[Landie]
Uh, I believe at dying four. Or there are feats that give you more dying. Yes, it is dying four.

Sorry.

[James]
Oh, whoops. That was supposed to be... And Jacob.

Hold on, don't quit that. Fixed. There we go.

All right. This one you may make your reflex saves, gentlemen.

[Landie]
That's huge. I believe being unconscious gives you an advantage.

[Speaker 4]
I auto-fail. I'm unconscious. You can't exactly dodge while I'm unconscious.

[Speaker 6]
Can you please?

[Speaker 4]
Pressing the button does an auto-fail.

[Speaker 6]
Unconscious gives you...

[Speaker 4]
It doesn't say auto-fail. You still roll?

[Speaker 6]
Okay, that is weird.

[Speaker 4]
Like, am I rolling around in my sleep to dodge things?

[Speaker 6]
How does that work?

[James]
Verheer, are you back inside the game?

[Speaker 4]
He is not.

[Speaker 5]
No, that's what I was saying. I can't join.

[James]
Yeah, no, I did do the kick thing. I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
That's my option as my login is carried out.

[Landie]
Jacob the goat.

[James]
I don't think anybody has any reactions here. All right, so you do take damage from the thing, so...

[Speaker 4]
That's dying too.

[James]
All right, so you're at one?

[Landie]
So now after the reflex save, Ki is dying too. And then after the forward save, he is still dying too. Great.

[James]
Oh, because he doesn't take damage for...

[Landie]
And Jacob doesn't need to worry about poison.

[James]
Jacob! Jacob, our boy! Now another reflex save.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I think so.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it could have gone fail, I'm dead.

[Heart]
So we have to save him from being eaten. No, I'm already dead.

[Landie]
You don't have any hero points?

[James]
Oh, I don't have any hero points left?

[Speaker 4]
Nope. Nope. You already used them.

[Heart]
All? Both of them?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. We've only got... we've only had two so far, and I'm pretty sure...

Three. But also, yeah. That's the case.

Love how I'm always saying, Oh, I should save my hero points in case I need it. The one time I don't, I end up dying.

[Heart]
You should... you might have had three in total since we got two bonus.

[Speaker 4]
We had three in total, but I don't know... Oh, if we had three in total, then I do still have one.

[Heart]
So you still have one left?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, but honestly, hero points... Is hero points the same if you don't want to do anything? Because I have them, but...

[Landie]
Yes, but let's do anything. No, you spend the hero point, you don't... you stop dying, you don't get wounded.

So that means you can take another four levels of dying before you die.

[James]
Well, the use here is, can you use that on... When can you do that for your hero points?

[Landie]
You can do it when you gain a dying level. So when Ki crit failed and gained two, you instead would not be dying if you spent your hero point.

[Speaker 4]
Interesting. Yeah, if I do that, then... Do you shoot me that?

I don't know how to do that, but...

[James]
I still don't think that there's a third... Or that you haven't used the hero points. I'm pretty sure that you've used the hero points.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know, I thought we'd only gotten two so far, and I'm pretty sure I've used two, but...

[James]
We started with one.

[Speaker 6]
We've gotten three.

[James]
And then I sent you... I manually sent everybody's to two.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Speaker 5]
You didn't voice out the fly as well, too.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, thank you!

[James]
The problem is not having a hero point. Unfortunately, Kiluget is dead, and I suppose we begin haunting this place.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, technically as a cleric of the psychopomp of heroic deaths, does this count? Like, I mean, I think fighting a lot is a valiant final stand, which is... So, I guess he'd be pretty okay with his death.

[James]
Yeah, no, that fucking rocks.

[Landie]
I think it gets more heroic than this.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, it doesn't get more heroic. I mean, dying solo to a swarm of giant centipedes is not particularly glorious, but I mean, doing it for the sake of the rest of his party, I think that counts.

[James]
Yeah, I think saving the rest of his party definitely counts here.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[James]
That's rough. Very good.

[Speaker 4]
So, I mean, hey, his soul gets collected by his god then, let's go.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so Jacob is dead dead?

[Landie]
Jacob's fine.

[Speaker 5]
Jacob's chilling.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, sorry, um... He is dead dead, yes. Yes, dead dead, but he needs to be revived dead.

[Heart]
Oh, I thought you used the hero point. Sorry, my thing cut me for a second.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, the discussion was we had two hero points, not three, and I already used both.

[James]
You have had three hero points across the course of the session, even if one of those was used in one of the previous fights. Everybody was updated to two at the conclusion of the previous fight, but both of those have been used during this one.

[Speaker 5]
How do I rotate my icon? Oops. Oh, for this one, doesn't even have to be...

Yeah. Nah. Straight up, so it hits everyone but Jacob.

[James]
Oh, so it hits... so it hits everybody but Jacob. Uh, yeah.

Yep. Let me just do it like that.

[Speaker 5]
And then I'll get a DC 20 reflex save, please.

[James]
Oh, it doesn't... you didn't target everybody. Give me a sec.

[Speaker 5]
Everything's so jumbled, I can't tell what's targeted and what's not.

[James]
No worries, just drag it over and then redo everybody but Jacob.

[Speaker 5]
There we go. How do I do that?

[James]
I already did. You hold Shift-T, then...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, he keeps trying to get me to select the giant centipede.

[Speaker 6]
What is alive in there still?

[James]
So if one spot is, like, covering, then you do it. When did that... when did that swarm die?

[Landie]
Uh, persistent... did the persistent damage kill it?

[James]
I think it did.

[Landie]
Four damage, persistent.

[James]
Yeah. Is that at the end of its turn or the beginning of its turn?

[Landie]
Yes, the end of its turn. Ah.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty. So I think that's everything left alive?

[James]
Nope, there is still a centipede swarm there.

[Speaker 5]
It's got the two centipede swarms or is there three centipede swarms?

[James]
Sorry, say again?

[Speaker 5]
Is there three centipede swarms or only two centipede swarms?

[James]
There is a living centipede swarm. The one right in front of you.

[Speaker 5]
Good. I've got it selected from what I can tell. I can't select anything else.

Everything else has been covered by other tokens. I don't know how to select it.

[James]
I think you are clicking everything else. So just press T on anything else. Okay, now move over to a section where this thing...

Actually, let me just bring you to the front. That'll make it easier to target. Anything else you would like to do on your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, no, that's my three actions, so... Catman! Did they die from the damage?

No, it's alive!

[Speaker 6]
Hello!

[Landie]
Because they were all weak against it, aren't they? Against area damage, yeah.

[Heart]
Yeah. All right, I'm moving in because I cannot see the...

[Landie]
Can you move Jacob up there? Sorry.

[Heart]
So it's just this big guy that's still in the way. All right.

[James]
Give me a second. So maybe it didn't register as area damage.

[Speaker 6]
Area damage is a finicky one in Foundry.

[James]
Okay, so it has resistances and also has weaknesses. All right, so it is as it should be.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Heart]
So, currently, giant centipedes in the way. We're going to do a casting of Biting Guards. Just to damage it.

Woof. That's a shame. We're re-rolling that.

Perfect.

[Speaker 6]
Sick.

[Landie]
Thank god the centipedes understand your languages.

[Heart]
Oh, technically I'm yelling at it. It's Sonic, not mental. Who are the level ones?

[Landie]
It's linguistic, though.

[Heart]
He and Sierra?

[Speaker 6]
True.

[Landie]
Yes. Level up. Level up.

Give 800 XP. Sorry, 853 XP.

[James]
Oh, nope, sorry.

[Landie]
Oh, pretty close. I'll take that. Um, Maya likes keys, so she's not going to let anyone loot his corpse.

And I think she's just going to take him back to Brunlock and try and find someone to resurrect him. His body's still intact. Shouldn't be too expensive for a level one resurrect if there is someone in Brunlock that can do it.

[James]
There is. Also common, this is... Let's see here.

Behind the centipedes, there is no treasure in that room. But you would recall from the previous campaign, there is a secret door there.

[Heart]
Uh, all right. I'll walk. I'll cautiously walk in the room.

I imagine Key is being picked up.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Heart]
Most unfortunate.

[Landie]
I'm grabbing him.

[Heart]
All right.

[Landie]
Come on, buddy. We're getting out of here.

[Heart]
Just give him a little pat as Maya picks him up.

[Landie]
Uh, she's not strong enough to do that, so she's gently dragging him by his shoulders.

[Speaker 6]
His legs are moving on the ground.

[Heart]
I'll help you in a bit. What would I roll to re-find the secret door?

[James]
Probably a seek check. Just, um, I would say roll with advantage.

[Landie]
Fortune effect, hell yeah. Makes sense.

[Heart]
Seek, seek.

[James]
Give me a second. Clumsy from you to make it, uh, less likely to fail.

[Landie]
Oh, we have to resolve our poisons. Maya still has a check to make and, uh, Common's at like stage three or four.

[Heart]
Uh, I'm pretty sure centipede poison only goes up to two.

[James]
It goes up to four? It goes up for six. Well, no, it, here's the thing.

So it goes for a max of, um, six rounds. So there are no additional effects for going up to four. However!

[Landie]
So you really want to keep failing till it ends so you don't take any more damage.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Heart]
So, uh, do I just keep rolling before I start searching? Wait, what? Wait, hold on.

[Landie]
You only take the effects of the stage when you move to it. So if you stay at stage, the highest stage, you don't take any more damage. The problem with that is that the highest stage of some conditions is death.

So, okay. So, uh, really it's worse going between one and two constantly if there's only two stages, um, in combat. But obviously dying is really bad.

[Heart]
Oh, would you look at that, I failed again.

[Landie]
So now Maya's fine, um, and Common's still at the worst stage.

[Heart]
All right, so, ah, okay.

[Landie]
So you can shoot with, I don't know, with drugs you can choose to make it worse.

[James]
Well, here's the thing with, uh, success. I mean, that's, it's only stage one and two that have effects.

[Landie]
Ah, so what's that put Common to then? Stage three?

[James]
Uh, stage four. No, because Common was stage four, and then went to five, and then just went back to four.

[Landie]
Does it have five stages?

[James]
No.

[Landie]
Oh, can you ping the poison, please?

[James]
Yeah, yeah, no, I, I think I'm 100% getting something wrong here.

[Landie]
Oh, so you can't go beyond its maximum stage. So Common is perpetually at stage two, regardless of how many times she has failed. Um, uh, there's no penalty for, I believe.

[James]
Okay, so Common...

[Landie]
It lasts for, I need to check that.

[James]
Maybe Common's gonna have... So she's back down to stage one.

[Speaker 6]
Ow.

[Landie]
I might be wrong. She might be taking stage two every time she fails, because it only lasts for one round.

[Heart]
All right, well, and again. Well, after this it's the last time, so that would have been six rounds.

[Landie]
At the end of a stage's interval you must attempt a new saving throw. Uh, okay. If a failure or a critical failure would increase the stage beyond the highest listed stage, the affliction instead repeats the effect of the highest stage.

So I was wrong. Being at stage two constantly is bad. But Common would have had time to cast healing magic in this point if she is looking rough.

[Heart]
I have been constantly poisoned. Yes, I'm casting healing magic on myself.

[Landie]
How many checks is that? You'd nearly be at six.

[Heart]
Yeah, no, that's... I am at six, that was it. Well, I had to catch up on the damage.

That's the problem. Okay, so I'm taking all the...

[Speaker 4]
Someone has medicine, they can treat poison.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah.

[Landie]
Um, so you've got like four rounds left of this poison?

[Heart]
No, we're done with poison. That's fixed.

[Landie]
Okay, okay, we're done with poison, great.

[Heart]
No, no more poisoning me. Now I can go seek without, um... All right, perception, blind, GM roll.

The corner, you've lost damage. Tell me if I need to re-roll it. Wait, re-roll, keep the high result.

[James]
You're fine, you get exactly 100.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, nice.

[Heart]
So secret door time.

[James]
Anytime y'all can take like a 10 minute break, go over your plans for attempting resurrection.

[Speaker 6]
Sourcing rules for resurrection.

[Speaker 5]
I'll look that up soon. Resurrection is a ritual. Resurrection is a ritual.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. And it costs...

[Heart]
For um... For a key, it would only cost 75 gold, because he's a level one, since it's 75 times the target's level.

[Speaker 4]
That is uh, more gold than he currently has. Um... He's a wuss.

[Speaker 6]
My ass wins.

[Speaker 4]
So if y'all maybe want to chip in, since he did die, to help y'all at all.

[Speaker 5]
Does that 2,000 cope recover?

[James]
Oh, that would be... Now you have 2,000 gold and a dead body to pull out. That's the trick.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Heart]
2,000 cover is 20 gold.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think anyone's a 5th level caster. Do we have a 5th level caster?

[Speaker 4]
That's like a...

[Landie]
You don't need to be a caster to do a ritual.

[Speaker 4]
You do need to actually know the ritual, though.

[Landie]
But someone in town knows the ritual, so they're probably going to be the primary caster anyway.

[Heart]
Yeah, so we just have to be someone in Bronloch.

[James]
We're not discussing whether a party member knows Resurrect or something like that. They're discussing whether... Like, uh...

Where to look for somebody to have this cast.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you do have to be a caster to do rituals. Do you?

[Heart]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
And the secondary casters also need to do checks.

[Heart]
Not all rituals. Some of them.

[Landie]
No, you don't. That's not what that means.

[Heart]
Post the rules. What's going on here? Anyway.

[Landie]
A ritual is an esoteric and complex spell that anyone can cast. It takes much longer to cast a ritual than a normal spell, but rituals can have more powerful effects.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, there we go.

[Heart]
So, the secret door has been found?

[James]
It has. I'm at... That's...

We're taking a brief break while I add stuff to the secret door.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but... So you must know that the ritual rate cannot be no higher. The ritual rate cannot be no higher than half your level rounded up.

So it's a fifth level spell, so it would need to be a level 10.

[Landie]
Again, rituals do not require spell slots.

[Speaker 6]
We can also just find someone in town.

[James]
You are finding... There is nobody in... You are only finding somebody in town.

It's a completely meaningless discussion.

[Heart]
Yeah, because no player is high enough to cast it anyway. We're finding someone in town to do it.

[Speaker 4]
And they probably have their own secondary caster, so... Exactly. It's just a matter of paying for it and actually finding the person to cast.

[Heart]
Yes. And again, because you're level one, it's actually quite cheap for you.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, if y'all are willing to spare 75 gold out of the loot from this to pay for the resurrection, I suppose.

[Landie]
And one of my other characters patron is James. I have a very rich penguin.

[Heart]
Would your rich penguin help someone revive like that? If so, sure.

[Landie]
He absolutely would. He would expect that you help him out in the future, but he is one to pity on a tortured soul like himself.

[Speaker 6]
Does that say so long as he doesn't ask...

[Speaker 4]
So long as he's not asked to do anything anathema. Although, ironically, if your character is a tortured soul, it would actually be within my edicts to help them.

[Speaker 6]
So it works out.

[Landie]
Like, worst case scenario is he's just gonna ask you to pay him back at some point. Like, he's not stressed about it. He's just a chill penguin.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I mean, it's not like he exactly is in a position to accept or decline here, because he's dead. Just up to the rest of the party to decide to ask the penguin for help.

[Heart]
If your penguin would help in this scenario, then yes, you can do the whole trade thing. It's the same with giving items to other characters, like how we saved the cheese elixir for Ver, because the characters there know Ver.

[Landie]
All right, I'm gonna deduct 75 gold from CC's sheet, and you just need to... I'm not from CC's.

[James]
But it is... All right, I will mark this as a... Yeah, I don't know what mark it is.

[Speaker 5]
But the chest is there.

[Heart]
The folding boat! Oh, I missed you so much.

[James]
What do you mean you missed the folding boat? Nobody used the fucking folding boat. I missed it.

[Speaker 6]
It was delight.

[Heart]
I loved having it in my inventory. It was delightful.

[Landie]
I love having something that weighs like 20 bulk in my inventory.

[Heart]
Exactly.

[Speaker 4]
That seems a bit inconvenient for, like, anybody.

[Landie]
I don't know how much it actually weighs.

[James]
It's one bulk. That's the point of the folding boat?

[Heart]
Yes. I actually did use the folding boat when trying to de-vampirize someone. Oh, I see.

So we did use it. It was a great item, and I love it so much. Woohoo!

[Landie]
It doesn't even weigh that much in 5e.

[Heart]
Yes, this was in 5e.

[James]
Yeah, but did you give it to, um... What was it? That, the lieutenant, the girl at the end of...

I can't remember her name right now. I do have her name.

[Heart]
No, Kamon... Yes, no, Kamon wasn't the one on that space mission. So she didn't.

But I think she'd be happy to see that it's still where it was last time in the chest. Oh, the fucking Nosferatu from that one game.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Heart]
Yes, yeah. When de-vampirizing him in order to not kill the guy, the boat was actually useful in that aspect. That didn't turn out well.

[James]
Yeah. You guys did get him back.

[Heart]
But during that mission... Yes. In that mission specifically, it went well.

Anywho.

[Speaker 5]
We should have a campaign stash that we can put cool community items in there.

[Heart]
There is enough gold in here to revive Xanath, so we can just remove that from the loot. I will... You know what, let me put it in the party sheet so the rest of you can see this.

Thank you once again for the amazing chest. It was an accident! I am strictly taking the whole thing with me, sorry.

Let me move all this stuff to the party sheet.

[Landie]
All right, so... Do we just want to split the rest of the money four ways after... Oh hang on, how many characters do we have?

Yeah, four ways after deducting the money to revive Ki.

[Heart]
Sure.

[Speaker 5]
Can we get a consent that we can use the fallen boat if we're going on a world-based campaign?

[Heart]
Sure, you can borrow the boat from her if you're sailing, you just have to bring it back in one piece. You'll be quite upset otherwise.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I mean, I'm not, just because I'll be dead, so I mean...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, true, true.

[Heart]
All right. Okey-doke. Um, so let me do the splitting of the gold after subtracting 75.

So 45 left.

[Landie]
Can we put the gold back in, the money back in a chest and then just divide it?

[Heart]
Well, I've subtracted 75 for his revival, so yeah, I can just put it back in the chest.

[Landie]
James, we require your duty.

[Heart]
No, no, no, I can, I can move them all in first. Hold on. Okay, all the gold, silver, and copper have been moved into.

[Landie]
I love the divide money feature.

[Heart]
I know, it's awesome.

[Landie]
The boat's worth 500 gold.

[Heart]
Hey.

[James]
Sierra, Bear, Maya, Hammond.

[Landie]
Yeah, I guess you need a folding boat if you're a councillor. Makes sense.

[Heart]
Oh, and now we don't have to pay for the ship over.

[James]
Right, which I'll be deleting the remainder of the gold I've been charging you guys at. Hey!

[Landie]
Does anyone have, like, the checks to pilot a boat?

[Heart]
I have one character who has sailing lore, and currently they're still level one, so probably.

[Landie]
Sailing lore, that's perfect, yeah, great.

[Heart]
You know Levent? That's his.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[James]
What I should do, I should, um, I should put shopkeep, like, uh, tokens up in, like, the hidden blob and, um.

[Landie]
Yeah, maybe we should make, like, a hub, um, a hub page that has, like, a box with, like, hidden bluff and the merchants in that box, or something, and then, like.

[James]
That's basically where hidden bluff docks is, is, um, because I think anybody.

[Landie]
That way, um.

[James]
Click that.

[Landie]
Yeah.

[James]
Commissions.

[Landie]
Yeah, no, you're right, I can just travel to it and drag a token, and we have, um, oh no, the seller has gone. Have you? Yeah, that's cool, I like that.

[James]
Yeah, so I could do that, um. Nessie has her personal, her personal dude, Ilia, I guess, at, uh, her hollow.

[Landie]
He was the one with the flamethrower, wasn't he?

[James]
He was the one with the flamethrower. Yes, he was.

[Landie]
I need to pick a skill feed for Sierra. Hmm.

[James]
I need to automate. What do rogues get at level two? Out of the, uh, out of the kingdom stuff.

[Landie]
Also, I am still dead certain anyone can cast a ritual, if you know it. It's just learning, it's the pain.

[Heart]
Oh, um, Xanath, for next, next time, since we have technically paid the gold, I imagine we found a guy to revive you, so you can fix yourself, and like.

[James]
No, no, we gotta go back to Bronloch, so, what's, I don't know how resurrection works.

[Landie]
So there are spells that do it. The lowest, uh, the easiest access would be the ritual, if someone in Bronloch knows it, which we've established they do. Uh, to cast the ritual, um, oh, we need to reincarnate.

How, how much do you love being a bat?

[Heart]
There's regular resurrect, we don't have to reincarnate in that.

[Speaker 4]
I was gonna say, if I have, if we do reincarnate, I have to go find a different character art. You know how hard it is to find a good art, where, a character with like a scythe that isn't edgy? Okay, this is edgy, but still, you know what I mean?

It's gotta have the right vibes. But it's so much cheaper.

[Landie]
Reincarnate only needs rare herbs, it's way cheaper.

[Heart]
We subtracted the gold already, we might as well.

[Landie]
Yeah, we might as well. Resurrect is a fifth level ritual, I'll post it to the chat. I'll tell the overflow, that would be, um, I'm not going to post it to the foundry, because I can't do that without adding it to my sheet, and I don't know it.

You call forth the soul. So the primary caster is the person we're commissioning. They would do the, um, the religion check.

And if we're paying them, I would assume they're going to pass, but it'd be pretty funny if they failed.

[James]
Yeah, they could still totally fail.

[Landie]
Um, okay, so I wonder if there's, like, an NPC for this. Maybe, like, a cleric NPC that would work?

[James]
You guys did make friends. It was common, I would say, made pretty good friends with the, um... So I don't think that the guy from the White Point Temple would be able to do this, even though he owes you a favor.

But the Seeker's Temple itself owes you guys a favor for recovering some, one, recovering some of the ruins, two, so that they could, like, ward themselves off from the demons, and, uh, two, to rescue one of the members of the High Priest of the Seeker's Temple.

[Landie]
Great, there's a High Priest stat block. So, um, this is just for a Cleric of Phrasma, but I assume they would have a pretty similar bonus to religion. They have a plus 26 to their check.

The DC of a fifth level ritual would be... Um, now I need to look at the table.

[Speaker 4]
It'd be an expert level check, or is it expert prerequisite?

[Speaker 5]
The primary check usually has a very high DC for a level, that's twice a ritual's spell rank.

[James]
This is very likely to...

[Speaker 5]
So it's, um, spell rank's 5, so it'd be DC for a level 10.

[James]
Where's 41 on that?

[Speaker 4]
I got a 41.

[Speaker 6]
Um, let me look.

[Landie]
I'm pretty sure that's a crit success. I don't see a wild where it's not. Um, ah, no, very hard.

Hang on.

[Speaker 5]
I think it's only a normal.

[Speaker 4]
A normal what?

[Landie]
A normal success. Um, that doesn't... That doesn't include the bonuses from the secondary casters, which it needs.

So a ritual has a primary caster, and Resurrect has two secondary.

[Heart]
Oh, sure.

[Speaker 5]
Who are we getting to do the, um, the secondary checks?

[Landie]
Do they have some priest sitting about?

[Speaker 4]
So presumably they're able to provide their own secondary casters?

[Speaker 6]
Do they charge extra for the secondary and the primary?

[Heart]
The check is simple enough that we could act as secondary.

[Speaker 5]
No. The check is like, uh, 29.

[Heart]
Oh my god, never mind.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah, the fifth level ritual.

[Heart]
It's... is this not a moderate? What the fuck is moderate?

What the fuck are you guys talking about? Oh my god, sorry. Here, let me get it for you.

[Speaker 5]
So it's in the...

[Heart]
Actually, it's there. VoiceOverFlow.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's in Foundry and VoiceOverFlow.

[James]
Let's see, that's... guys, this is for, like, building monsters. Um, so the first link...

What's 26 to the roll?

[Landie]
The first link I have sent is the difficulty class, so you use that to do, um... Oh, it has all of it. It has DC by level as well.

So a very hard ritual is plus five to the DC, and a ritual, uh, check is a very hard DC for a level that's twice the ritual's rank. So if we look at the same... on that same with the difficulty classes just above, it's level-based DC.

A DC for a 10th rank's, uh, a 10th level is 27, so it is a DC of 32.

[James]
Okay, and then...

[Landie]
And so we still, um, for the ritual we still need the two secondary casters, which can... they can use medicine or society. I don't know...

[James]
And what are they going to do when they do that?

[Landie]
If they succeed on their secondary checks, they give a plus one bonus to the primary check, and if they crit succeed, they give plus two each. And if they crit fail, they give minus one each as they're actively interfering.

[Heart]
But either way, wouldn't the 41 succeed?

[Landie]
We could get a crit out of this though, which is good.

[Heart]
You get a crit, I get to meet my god.

[Landie]
Um, how long's the last four?

[Heart]
You can sleep after that. It's a birthday.

[Landie]
For one week, that would be like an accession.

[James]
It is, it is worth examining at the very least.

[Landie]
I'll have a look for any stat blocks that could work well, because I assume the secondary casters aren't as strong as the high priest.

[Speaker 4]
That is correct.

[Landie]
Do you have a idea of level for them?

[Speaker 4]
You can't get three high priests to help at once?

[Landie]
Um, there are just, there's a regular priest stat block. They are a level six creature. They have a plus 14 to medicine if you would like to use that.

Um, if you would like them to be lower level, we can do the math.

[James]
You said a, there's a regular priest stat block.

[Landie]
So the default priest is, um, the priest of phrasma. They are level six.

[James]
That's the high priest.

[Landie]
The high priest was level nine, I believe.

[James]
High priest of phrasma. I'm looking at NPC core. I see priest of Sarenrae, um, creature six.

[Landie]
I'm just looking at the, uh, devotee creature family. So that has the list of all the priests. Great.

Excellent.

[James]
Which means I should, wrong lock. Just wondering who's there to control.

[Landie]
We're actually getting a bunch of blasphemers to do this ritual.

[James]
So I'll put the high priest, yeah, in there and then the priestess of Sarenrae.

[Landie]
Yep, so that's the level six priest.

[James]
I'll make that the lady that you guys rescued.

[Landie]
I love NPC core, great book. I'm so glad I hit level two. They can both be medicine, I think, if they don't have society.

[James]
One of them does have society. I'm going to have the higher one be, I said, I think a 23, which is a failure, but not a critical failure.

[Landie]
Oh no, they must attempt the society. They can't both do medicine, sorry.

[James]
Let's go ahead and send actual natural 20 to get, no, right, so he failed.

[Landie]
Okay, it's just success.

[James]
Yeah, so it's just, that's still good though. So you just have, uh.

[Landie]
Uh, you return to life with one hit point, no spells prepared or points in any pools. You're still affected by any long-term debilitations of the old body. Uh, I don't think you had any.

Not that we, oh, I guess you're damn purism. Instead of inspired, you're a clumsy one, drained one, and enfeebled one for one week. So don't play with this character next Saturday.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, next Saturday would be over a week. I'd be fine by next Saturday.

[Landie]
Oh, well, it's my Saturday. Sorry, your next Friday.

[Heart]
I'm a stranger. Congratulations.

[James]
You have one hit point. Uh, I did apply the XP.

[Speaker 4]
I'm actually almost level two now. Hooray.

[Speaker 6]
Awesome. No, you're not.

[Speaker 4]
Last I looked, I was like 600. I consider 600 close. It's like over.

Somebody said, I'm like, I'm level two now.

[James]
I was like...

[Speaker 4]
No, I said almost. Or close, I said close to, not almost even.

[James]
Yeah, that's true. You are closer to level two than you are to level zero. This is true.

Exactly.

[Landie]
This is more of like a setting question, but was it hard for the priest to do this? Like, they just made some serious money doing this for us. I guess not everyone can pay to do it is the limiting factor.

[James]
Yeah, there's also the time factor. So she has to spend, not only does she have to spend a day out, but not Lady Jessica, she has a different name, had to spend a full day. And then there was an adage.

And the Seeker's Temple itself has been getting assaulted by people from the Fiend Cult. So they're like... It's not about like...

In a white room, it was moderately... No, for a level one character in a white room, it was not difficult to bring them back. Imbran...

[Landie]
If they need help with anything specific, Maia's happy to be enlisted into level one adventures for them. For them helping us.

[James]
They kind of consider this as like paying back a favor to Camon is why they're accepting it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Cool.

[Landie]
Well, great job, everyone. We came out of it not too bad.

[Speaker 4]
Only one person died. That's not too terrible. Yeah, no, I'm very happy.

I got another kill.

[James]
And it was in a relatively level-appropriate encounter.

[Landie]
No, that was really good. Thank you for dying for us.

[James]
Yeah, thank you for dying with Grace, specifically.

[Speaker 4]
I'm guessing you had to pitch Fiends when their characters died?

[Landie]
There was a guy in the first Westmarch, he built his character entirely around having a really high AC. And then he... Mack told me about this, James, when he was playing.

I think he got hit by a save or something, and everyone left him to die in a train. He then went on a tirade about how he was going to be a pillar of the server and make a character that was like...

[Speaker 4]
That sounds hilarious. So basically the exact same thing happened to him, that basically happened to me, because I also just died to a bunch of saves, because I have god-awful dexterity. Dude, that was like eight years ago.

[Speaker 6]
Holy shit.

[Landie]
He bragged about how great his character was like so many times in chat, and it was so funny. He was like multiclassed in like Bladesinger and stuff to get like a really high AC. Like it was one of those like...

Yeah, it was a Lightroom build.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see, I know exactly what that build is. You go monk with Bladesinger, so you get like... So you get dex, int, and wiz to your AC without using armor, and you also have shield spell available.

Yeah. In theory, if you get to super high levels, monk gets proficiency in all saves, so you could be good at saves too, and in the pain of the DM, and then in practice, it's just like good luck making it there, because that's like level 17 for the monk or whatever. Yeah, you're not making it there.

With a goddamn wizard monk.

[Landie]
Watching that dude spiral was like one of... That was so funny. It was like...

It was incredible hearing the play by play.

[James]
He was yelling at me for not having a lore book for the campaign.

[Landie]
That was that guy too? Holy shit.

[James]
Yes, while I was literally in the process of writing a lore book for the cosmology. There's not as many things relevant to it in this campaign, except for the stuff about the Fae. Obviously, those are like Loctite, and planar travel, which I should probably...

I think there is a link to it, actually. Let me look if there's a link to Astral Tides. It was very funny because I was like, well, you haven't given me all the info about your campaign.

I'm like, first of all, fuck you, idiot. Rolling dice. But second of all, I'm actually literally in the middle of like writing that thing.

Oh, here we go. Yes. It's in this one, if you would like some light reading.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Unknown. Oh, the Astral Tides.

[James]
There it is. That was a good read. I think Perihih and Zenith have not encountered this before.

[Speaker 4]
I have definitely not. I'll have to give that a read at some point.

[James]
The sections on the Fae are like the, I would say, the particularly relevant. ones. Because the one about Braccus and the world is Braccus.

But the history primarily covers like the other side of the planet.

[Speaker 5]
The other main continents. A lot of pages.

[Landie]
Oh, yeah. So my next character for Samid is a guy who's really into like small conflicts on the other side of the planet exclusively. He knows what's happening in Braccus, doesn't know what's going on in the valley at all.

[James]
I love it. He's just here for.

[Speaker 6]
I need to be.

[James]
The third post-war. Like you guys got like. Terrors.

Some guns, right? You're like. We got a lot of fairies.

Does that count?

[Landie]
That was like an ash hit from the Fae wilds going around for a bit.

[James]
Yeah, the dream.

[Landie]
Gayest ship in the realm. I love it.

[James]
Ooh, do we get webcasters? Do you like your ship for a name? Fairy gay.

[Landie]
I assume there is something similar. You can get. Yeah, I love that pirate.

Maya was deeply offended at first, but realized he's actually based. She should have known that because he's a pirate. All pirates are based.

Like it's. It's so obvious. Unless they're Niyogi vampire pirates or whatever the fuck it was.

[James]
Fuck the vampires. Anybody who doesn't speak with a pirate accent. A pirate that doesn't speak with a pirate accent can't be trusted.

That's what that was the issue with the vampires is they were speaking with a Native American accent. But using the lingo of pirates.

[Landie]
All right, Sierra's.

[James]
Stealth.

[Landie]
Surely life won't go terribly for her now.

[Heart]
Yes. I've got to ask you something because I can't see it during level up. This is completely off topic now.

Um, can you guys when for archetype feats, I can't see the venture gossip one. I think I might just be blind, but.

[Landie]
It might be a source problem because of the origin of it.

[Heart]
I see. It is in Foolish Housekeeping. That does make sense.

Is that a. Oh, sorry. Sorry, what did you say?

Go ahead.

[James]
No, no, I'm thinking to myself.

[Landie]
The name of it's Foolish Housekeeping, sorry.

[Heart]
Oh, that's the source. It's from the Foolish Housekeeping and other articles sourcebook.

[Landie]
Um, let me find someone might have made a module for it. We might need to add that to the game. It doesn't look like it's in.

[Speaker 4]
Right, if we're just leveling up characters. Am I uh, let's go ahead and skedaddle.

[James]
Oh, yeah, no, no, you're good. You're good. Thank you so much for playing.

[Landie]
Thanks for playing. Thanks for saving my life.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, oh, yeah, thanks. Thanks for hosting. Thanks for sacrificing pretty much all of our rewards just to revive me.

Other than a folding boat. Nah, it's all good. We didn't get a boat, did we?

No good.

[James]
So they got they got like 100 gold to begin with and then also like uh, 25 in silver and then like another 20 in copper. And then there's a bunch of valuable shit for uh, the items that you guys got. Those bombs.

I gotta start adding bombs to the uh, the things. I thought was okay. Was that was that an okay solution for at least the Fae for like, all right, I'm not familiar with all the fucking potions as much.

I'm not gonna encounter as many. I need people to show me all the cool potions because I'm still working my way through.

[Landie]
Oh, yeah, there's so many potions. Yeah, I think that's a really good solution. The potions, yeah.

Until you get players that are like picking the same ones every time, like no, pick something else. They're not all, they don't all have invisibility potions.

[Speaker 5]
All the enemies have a chance to use them.

[Landie]
We're just fighting invisible pixies.

[Heart]
God, that's gonna be terrifying.

[James]
Okay, I'm gonna try to do down the brown lock so I can open its kingdom sheet. Wait, can I do a kingdom sheet with, do you have to be in there? Or can I just foss a person into the leadership positions?

I can't.

[Heart]
Hey, do I have something?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'll see y'all whenever I end up in a session.

[Heart]
See you. Oh, I guess I then will just add a note somewhere to add foolish housekeeping if there's a module for it. Let me, you know what, let me check myself.

There we go.

[James]
Because I can't have an actor in multiple parties at once, but it's okay because I can put, the actor doesn't have to be in a party for me to set the kingdom. Or for me to add them to a kingdom as a, as a like, counselor pet deal.

[Landie]
I was really surprised when Zenith became less whiny off to dying. I was like genuinely impressed by them with how they took that.

[James]
That was great. I'm gonna send him compliments. Because that was, that was awesome.

[Heart]
Where do you find modules?

[Landie]
Um, I'm looking into it. Sorry.

[Speaker 6]
It's fine.

[Heart]
You should sell your mom.

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 5]
I think we all heard that at a certain time saying you should sell your mom.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
What? At the same time? Murder is, I mean slavery is worse than murder.

[James]
You agree. You agree that slavery is worse than murder.

[Speaker 6]
Who?

[James]
What brought this on?

[Heart]
What brought this on? Genuinely. What's happening?

They always send me fucking...

[James]
I always get Bo Burnham memes from, uh, from Texas Town Boy. It's always a remix of when she says like, you should kill your mama.

[Heart]
I see. Okay.

[James]
You kind of kind of mix in with like a Shane Gillis joke, I think. I'm not sure what this is. Sometimes they just say things, actually.

They don't need to be justified at all.

[Speaker 5]
Sometimes they should be justified. Sometimes that makes it worse. Like we got into this nice, we got into this nice mansion.

We made it by brownies. It's like, is James really a racist?

[Landie]
I might ask the, um, pf2e foundry, reddit, not reddit, discord about, um, venture gossip because it doesn't look too tricky because a lot of the feats in it already exist in the game. It's just the dedication that, oh, there's a couple. There's, there's a couple that come from it, but uh, someone probably has a, I'll look into that for you.

[Heart]
Thank you, much appreciated.

[Landie]
Because the foolish housekeeping and other articles isn't a book source. So I don't know if it's in the, it's a blog post, which is why it, um, that's my guess as to why we can't find it in the compendium, but we might've just missed it. I'm not sure.

[Speaker 6]
Is it?

[James]
It's like official content. It's like a panel, right?

[Heart]
Um, semi-official.

[Landie]
Technically it's official. I think it's official. I don't know.

[Heart]
It is official. It counts.

[Landie]
It is official. Yeah. It's not even banned or anything.

Yeah. It's just legal content.

[James]
This is a product page. Uh, fucking, it's on the, it's on the Pyso store.

[Landie]
Uh, that links to the community blog though. Oh. Um, because it's all free, I suppose.

You don't need to pay. Um, I was going to say something, but I've forgotten what it was.

[Heart]
I still find the speedrunning feats very funny.

[Speaker 5]
Um, someone had the earn income macro in the game. I just tried one then, but I only had it for one day.

[Heart]
Just multiply it.

[Landie]
Um, it doesn't give you the option to set a day?

[Speaker 5]
Well, that's what someone had one before and I had it for five days and I had like the total income for the five days. I was like, oh, that's cool.

[Landie]
When I click the macro, I get an option to change the skill, the level and the days. You don't get those three options.

[Heart]
Okay, it looks grayed out. You can still click it. Like that little box.

It looks grayed out. You can still click it. That's probably it.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, okay. Yeah, there we go.

[Speaker 4]
Perfect.

[Heart]
Very welcome.

[James]
I could use this to keep track of the other council members.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
And then.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, with the skeleton cave now being cleared, has the skeleton cave been cleared now?

[Landie]
No, there is something very bad in the skeleton cave.

[James]
I need to roll my dice.

[Heart]
Oh, yes. There's the evil, evil thing.

[Landie]
Uh, should I switch it? Um, over the week, um, there was a volunteer who, uh, agreed to move into the aura of the creature and they were pretty much instantly killed.

[Speaker 6]
Oh my god.

[Heart]
Okay, that's good to know.

[Landie]
But the skeleton did animate eventually. So that's a good sign if you're into that.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, that is a very good sign. Crafty.

[Heart]
So did you say they were vaporized or just murdered? They just died?

[Landie]
Um, you saw, like, uh, his soul get torn from his body, essentially. The creature, like, um, moved as it did that. But, uh, it didn't- it has not broken its chains like it did in the dream Makanon had.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Landie]
Makanon, you're still, like, getting the frightened three condition whenever you're around that creature. It's awful.

[Heart]
Oh, that actually reminds me of something. Uh, here. It's in voice.

Oop, that's campaign chat. Not voiceover. Give me a second.

Here we go.

[James]
That's very good.

[Landie]
That's so good. I have remembered what I wanted to talk about. It was about earn income.

Um, I- I don't know what a good penalty for crit failing earn income is. Um, like, obviously it varies from income to income. Like, uh, like crit failing, um, like Underworld lore.

If you're, like, I don't know, breaking into people's houses and stuff. Like, that's probably going to get you, like, arrested or something, realistically.

[James]
Well, the fun thing is, uh, unrest and stuff like that. So, for Chillness Valley, I had a secret system behind the- beyond the curtain of conflict, which could erupt into some of the other, like, non-combat modes. You know how I had, like, like, uh, kidnapping, heists, and stuff like that?

Um.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[James]
There are things like riots and whatnot. There was a secret system that was basically made to, like, tie those two together. So, if you guys are going throughout the city, eventually the city's going to kind of, like, boil over into conflict.

Uh, because that's- that's just what needs to happen in a game. So, but in Pathfinder 2nd Edition, I get to use- I get to use, uh, unrest instead. And, like, kingdom events.

[Speaker 5]
So, how many, uh, how many days of adventure did this take, sorry?

[James]
I would say overnight. Oh, and then there was, uh, okay, so you guys began on Friday. Saturday, ritual's happening.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think I'd take part in the ritual. Be a bit of my anathema.

[Heart]
Your anathema is not to bring people to life?

[Speaker 5]
Hold on. To real life, not un-life.

[Speaker 6]
Bro, you're going to get killed by someone. That's so- wait, hold on.

[Heart]
Can we see it? Have you made it be able to be visible? I want- I want to check out your sheet.

No, I can't see it. Ah, alas. Okay.

That is so funny.

[James]
Remember, if you're playing, like, Necromancer, do- like, at some point, somebody's going to be like, uh, fuck this guy.

[Landie]
Like, I don't think Rana can play with you. A character without trying to kill you, so... What kind of characters are available in situations like that?

[Heart]
I find it very funny because you're the exact opposite of my other- of my Necromancer.

[Landie]
I think Rana would try and kill Dr. Basha as well, honestly.

[Heart]
Really?

[Landie]
Oh my god, the plasma! Well, creating undead's, like, an evil act. Like, it's evil and it's mean.

[Heart]
True, fair. But it's less- it's more on the study of being able to get people to proper life, but also fair enough. So, probably just dodge Rana for now.

[James]
No, no, guys, don't do it for good reasons. I don't understand.

[Heart]
That's literally it.

[Landie]
I'm selling meth to these kids to- to help them in school. These kids need the meth.

[James]
I'm collecting taxes for good reasons, like Rose.

[Speaker 5]
Ha ha ha, well, we're gonna kill you.

[Speaker 6]
And also, fuck your race. You do need them for- you do need them for roads. You very much- Thanks a lot for making my roads.

[Heart]
You very much need them for roads. I can't- I can't- No, you do not.

[James]
Roads have existed for a very long time before taxes. You could- you could just do things. You could just walk outside and fill a pothole and it's fine.

It takes you 20 minutes and, like, 100 bucks tops, depending on how much stuff you need.

[Heart]
Okay, but, like, wait- I'm- I'm totally gonna be like- People don't do that. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
They do do it. They do do it, because the- You see, the problem is people don't do it.

[James]
Also don't actually fix the roads.

[Heart]
Yes, that's- So lots of people have to do that. Yeah, that is the problem. Yes, that is the problem.

If they did, if- if- listen, if taxes actually worked the way they were supposed to, then it would be a good road initiative thing.

[Landie]
What if we- No, I love giving billionaires tax breaks.

[Heart]
Yeah, that sucks.

[James]
What if- what if the only one's paying taxes, um, except for- which is the extra annoying thing, because I still have to pay taxes, but it's, like, this really paltry amount that only fucks me over, but doesn't help anybody else.

[Landie]
Exactly.

[James]
So what we should do is we should take the people- we should take the IRS, which just added, like, 80,000 people, I think, in 24- If all of them were slaves and we made them build the roads, it would be a lot more effective and a lot faster.

[Heart]
And less expensive. Admittedly, your tax system is very...

[James]
The secret is that all of them are- We gotta kill a lot of people. We gotta kill a lot of people. That's- that's all I'm saying, is...

I'm not being unreasonable. I just said make them all slaves and put them on the roads.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Landie]
We don't even have to put- Maybe we do need people raising undead to make roads.

[James]
We don't have to worry about workers' comp. We don't have to worry about, like, workplace safety. We don't even have to put the cones up.

We don't have to spend any money on the cones. Just if they get hit, that's... Who cares?

Good lord. They deserve it. Spit on them.

[Landie]
What if they damaged the cars of the people, like, driving, though? Would that not incentivize people to get tax- to get, like, insurance fraud by running over slaves?

[James]
I encourage you to watch my wonderful debate with Destiny on the subject of Luigi Manchego. Why- why we thought it was a good idea to bring in- Well, I guess it is a little bit of, like, rules- I deal with a lot of rules lawyers, and I guess that's kind of, like, the entire US insurance system. So it- I have driven you to this.

I did good in that debate. I did good. My debate partners were struggling.

Spit on them. Oh, man. I hope you all have a wonderful evening.

I love playing with you guys so much.

[Landie]
I still do have things I need to talk about and come with you about, but my brain's pretty fried.

[James]
Uh, Tosin, Tosin, chat briefly, because I- I think I have a pretty good list of consequences now that we're doing a real game.

[Landie]
The consequence- uh, the consequences I'm happy with, um, it sounds like you've got something cooking there. The other thing was just the, um...

[James]
People using, like, skills, right?

[Landie]
Yeah, like, it- it does make sense that people use some skills for it. Like, I think Carmen using diplomacy as a council member makes perfect sense, because that's, like, her job.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Landie]
Like, talking to people. Um, but- For anything else, I think it should be like- Like, I- I saw, um, I think, uh, um, Key used athletics last week, which I don't like, because, um...

[Speaker 5]
Well, this isn't a downtime. It needs to be, like, a relevant skill, Ben.

[Landie]
Well, the three traditional skills are crafting, um, any law, and... But I even wouldn't justify some laws being used, for example. Um, and performance.

And the stipulant on performance is that you can't earn, like, ridiculous amounts of money doing it, unless you're going to, like, specific places to perform. So, like, I don't know, maybe there would be, like, a prerequisite of doing, like, a day's worth of, like, gather information to find somewhere suitable to perform.

[James]
Is doing the- Um, or- What I- what I can do is, there's normally a process for, like, generating these jobs. To- Now, my- my assumption by default is just, like, all right, if you have- so that I don't have to do all of that manually, is if you have a skill that's approved for, uh, earn a income, and you're- and you're in a settlement that's not of, like, lower level, then you get- you can do- there is work for you up to your level, or the settlement's level, whichever one is lower. But for the other skills, I think what I'll do is just generate them, or have somebody look for them- have somebody else generate them by looking for them, which is, like, the normal process.

Somebody has to go looking for the jobs, the jobs are- And I can say from there, okay, well, there is one for athletics, or there is one for this thing, which is- is fun, because that also lets me change the levels around. So I could say, yeah, there is an athletics one, but it's only level one. There's also a level seven one, and it's for, like, a specific lore.

So if somebody wants to go for that thing that's higher level, then- then go for it.

[Speaker 6]
I like that.

[Landie]
That could be a good use of the threads, where you have, like, a thread for each city, and, like, their current job levels and stuff, and, like, um- The threads are very annoying.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was gonna add for a can of, like, rumors and- and stuff, so we can put down just random stuff.

[Landie]
I like that.

[Speaker 5]
Like, one dimensioning now, and then as well as potential quests. Like, when we have a few different selections of quests we can choose from, you can be like, oh yeah, this is the quest board. If you guys want to pick a quest, you know, we can do that quest for that session, and then just have, like, random rumors or just random RP stuff, and different events in the town.

So just say, like, oh yeah, someone's, um- A spellcaster has cursed someone to turn into a goose, you know, seeking a reward to, you know, can a spell. Yeah, you could do a downtime action to say, like, DC 20, um, arcane check. Um, when you earn so much income, you, um, negate the spell, free the person, and you're getting the reward, and you can even have competitions about who does it the best.

So, you know, the first person that does it, you know, they'll get the pot and, like, increased income. Those who fail or don't get it, miss out.

[Landie]
What? But who's turning all of these people into geese?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it could be story reason. This is an example as well.

[James]
I'm gonna move Samae Boogaloo back up to- and I will probably re-archive the Samae chat. Uh, character creation, I think I'm gonna keep that as a- I like it, yep. That seems like the only good use for, like, the other stuff.

And then I think I had- pretty sure I have a referee chat. I do have, like, an actual normal referee chat, actually.

[Speaker 5]
Hold on. Yeah, but there's, like, 40-something people in there.

[Landie]
Yeah, that's- all of the people that were playing in the, um, what is it, the Bronstein or whatever, all the faction-based stuff from last time are in that because their role has the referee permissions. But I guess, like, they don't play.

[James]
Yeah, no, they're not- you don't have to worry about them, uh, looking at shit. I mean, even if they- a lot of times they get- they get exposed to information. One, they're not doing it right now.

That will be in, uh, September. At the turn of the season.

[Heart]
Sick, we have to start worrying about the Winter Fairy. No!

[James]
That's enough time for you guys to patch back up to level, uh, 15 or whatever, isn't it? You guys are gonna be fine. Is it?

[Landie]
Oh, Nervin's five.

[Heart]
Ah, yeah, get 10 levels in two months.

[Landie]
She got- she would be higher if she could play more, but the only other level five is Para, so. Um, but I've also wanted to level my other goobers up. Let's see.

[James]
Doing higher level- start running higher level things like cannon fodder- high level cannon fodder.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I was- I was just on holidays for two weeks, and I was gonna think about running something this week, but I've got a cold. Aww. And I'm like, I wasn't even sure I was gonna play today.

Yeah, well, I'm on. I got the strongest medicines I could get. I had some other meds from overseas in Asia, where, you know, you don't require a prescription and just- Holy shit, they're strong.

[Landie]
Have you ever been to the Philippines?

[Speaker 5]
I was in Manila, yeah, in the Philippines.

[Landie]
Oh, yeah. Some good stuff.

[Speaker 5]
I was trying to convince my girlfriend, um, they have one there, so, in like, one of the poorer sections, they ravage the bins of, like, their McDonald's equivalent, which is like a Jollibee, and they do like spaghetti and pasta, I think, and they'll steal the leftover chicken from the bin, they'll wash it down, and cook it up again in some other weird mix, and then they sell it. I'm like, yeah, we should get some of that. And she's like, no.

I'm like, come on, just to try, and she's like, you'll die.

[Speaker 6]
That's what Vi was doing for earn income, with these other fucking Jollibee.

[Heart]
Jollibee actually has pretty good food, not going to lie.

[Landie]
There are Jollibee adjacent places in Sydney, and I like going there.

[Heart]
I went there once, it was pretty decent.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, she's got like a, she's got like a whole bunch of her family over here, and she was here for a student visa, that's when I met her, but her student visa ran out, because she's finished her course, so I was like, oh, okay.

[Heart]
Uh, alas.

[Landie]
My fiance is Filipino-Australian, so yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so like her brother's got a permanent residence over here. She's got like two uncles and three aunts, that also have permanent residency.

[Speaker 6]
Neat.

[Speaker 5]
So I'm like, I came too early.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, wow.

[Landie]
Um, so what skills are fine? Like, I think Nova doing warfare lore for her stuff with Mimosa makes sense.

[James]
I think lore has to be open for people to make money without annoying you too much.

[Landie]
Well, what about, so Cece is trained in awakened animal lore.

[James]
That's one hundred- What do you think? There is one hundred percent like an awakened animal training.

[Landie]
Okay, okay. Wait, um, okay, well, I guess if you can justify that lore, I think any lore is free game.

[Speaker 5]
Not if you're like a circus animal, you know, doing cool tricks and stuff.

[Landie]
That's what I'm saying. Giving lectures about awakened penguins.

[James]
I think all the lores are, uh, just have to be open, you know?

[Landie]
Okay, well, that makes it way easier then.

[James]
Um, I mean, that- I don't know. That is rules as written for the, um, for an income, right?

[Landie]
Yes. Uh, yes. The level of the job is up to the GM, of course, but I think limiting the level of that to the city is perfectly fine.

[James]
Yeah, well, player level or city or settlement level, level one is lower specifically.

[Landie]
Yes, I agree with that. Although making people roll level seven and incomes at level one would be very funny.

[James]
That's where the- Do you want to just curse everyone?

[Speaker 5]
But the thing is, though, if you do like a 23, like roll 23, and it's like the amount of payoff you'd get for it compared to, you know, if you just roll a 15 or something, it's kind of crazy.

[Heart]
Yes, but the thing is, it also makes bad consequences worse, because if you're level one trying to roll at level seven, you will get crit failures more often.

[Speaker 6]
Which- These idiots can't do any job.

[James]
That's what the other jobs are going to be available for, is like, all right, if you want to give it a shot, go ahead.

[Landie]
I like that, because I think that was how it was when the demons first arrived in Bronloch. Never tried a level five check to earn income and failed. When she was like level two or three.

That was cool. Would fail again.

[Heart]
Ten out of ten.

[Landie]
Um, so what are the others? It's crafting. I think crafting is always fine as well, because people are always buying magic items and shit, you know?

[Speaker 5]
Well, even crafting, because crafting is the amount that you craft, not necessarily the items you craft. So when you earn income, it's basically level dependent, because you can make just a whole bunch of low level stuff that's relevant.

[Landie]
Right, yeah. Um, like, I think crafting should always be a valid option for earning income, same as lore, at the city or player level. The only one of the three I'm iffy on is performance.

I don't know how to dictate how much they're earning for that, because I can't really see someone earning, like, seventh level income from performance. That's a lot of money people are giving out. Of course, there are exceptions, like, um, like a festival or something.

[James]
Yeah, or a holiday. One-to-one holidays. Christmas is gonna be a great opportunity, but don't fuck that up.

[Heart]
I did- I remember the Christmas special, um, session, that was fun. You did a good job.

[Landie]
We didn't kill Santa, we got a bunch of stuff from Santa's bag, didn't we?

[Heart]
Yes, yes, and we also dropped those evil, evil spiders. We did get very nice things, yes, but also evil, evil spiders.

[Landie]
And then he dumped a bunch of loot that hadn't been claimed as well, I think.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Landie]
Um, well, I need to do some earn incomes.

[Heart]
Enjoy, I'm going to try to go to bed early- well, earlier today, since we had an earlier session. Thank you so much.

[Landie]
Thanks for playing hard.

[Heart]
Thank you! Oh yeah, that's what I'm thinking of doing.

[James]
Earlier sessions, I was telling them this earlier, doing earlier sessions on Fridays, I think for you it's like now Saturday in the a.m., but if I do early, early sessions on Fridays, then I can sleep. Landy can do, for him, Saturday morning, like basically take over the time slot that I've been doing, that I've normally been doing. But at a time where like he gets to wake up at like a decent hour.

[Landie]
So that would be like, um, like 24 hours from now, roughly, or a bit later even? Is that the time slot you're talking about? No, no, the time slot- 24 hours from now is when I would- Yeah, so at what point would you- would it be ideal that I run then?

Because it's already Saturday here, I'm just getting confused, sorry.

[James]
You might want to hammer time this conversation. Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna do that, but for you, basically running it this time right now.

[Landie]
Yes, yep. Okay, I understand.

[James]
Or for anyone, that means I get a chance to sleep and wake up and stuff like that, but I'm still running stuff, and that means I can bring in more like-nearer people.

[Speaker 6]
Um.

[James]
If I get a bonus to my revival check- you did- okay, you know what? Yeah, definitely should have, just didn't, um, as a level one character, you know, it's fine.

[Landie]
I didn't give him the crit, like it's a plus one circumstance bonus or something for one session.

[James]
What do you mean crit? No, it's just for a session.

[Landie]
Well, it lasts for a week, so it's great in a narrative-based game that doesn't use one-to-one time, because that's like one week you've got a bonus to checks. Um, but in- so you resurrect the target, they are inspired by their god, they have a plus one status bonus to attack rolls, perception, saving throws, and skill checks for one week, and they get like a birthmark or some like personality cosmetic sort of thing for being cool and special. Well, I guess- I guess the sarcasm, that status bonus is like one of the few that you can use for like earn income as a status bonus, so we should be dying at the end of sessions more often.

I'm sure the cost of resurrection isn't like- 75 gold, and it didn't multiply.

[James]
Oh, because you have to- you have to factor out, like, you then lose a day, because the ritual takes a day. There's a 75 gold, and if you don't get the crit, then you instead get all the penalties that are going to be impacting you.

[Landie]
Let me look at the DC for a level 20 character.

[Heart]
Hey, it only goes up to level 8 or 10.

[Landie]
You can't heighten it?

[Heart]
I don't think so.

[Landie]
You can heighten it to 10th rank.

[Heart]
I will see you guys later.

[Landie]
Thanks for running.

[James]
All right, note to self, what I'd like to do is get this thing- yeah, set it up so that there's a table of skills and jobs. And then there's also the table of- probably two- yeah, no, no, no, probably two separate tables. So you have one table that's like declarative in that it uses- is that the right term?

Or is it relative? I don't know if declarative and relative is the right term here, but basically take something like Brownlock. You have a table that determines the level of the job, some of which are just static, and others of which are just based on the level of the town.

So you say, you know, result of 1 is just straight up level 1 job. Result of 2, whatever, you know, we'll make it a d20. Why not?

Yeah, maybe a d20. Yeah, yeah, no, we will make it a d20. And then some of the results are going to be more like relative, like, okay, it's the settlements level minus 3, minus 2.

Settlements level. Settlements level plus 2, plus 3. Everything for like the different teams that play there.

Also, I have things like- I also have things for like modifiers based on the duration.

[Speaker 6]
If these are special jobs in some way, they change things for the duration. So that's exciting.

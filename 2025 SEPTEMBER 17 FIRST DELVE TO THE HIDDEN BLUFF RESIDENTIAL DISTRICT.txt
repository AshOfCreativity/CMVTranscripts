[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and I don't want to pet cow. I don't know.

[Speaker 6]
Pet cow's the best. What?

[Speaker 2]
Cows are just big field puppies, they're so sweet. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And the best thing is, I'm going to do rations.

[Speaker 3]
Evil! You should look into the name White Utter as a cow. It's nothing dirty, it's a cow.

[Speaker 6]
But it's a real world cow, you should look into it. Very nice cow. Why am I in this city?

Why am I in this city?

[Speaker 5]
It's just the default. I drag you here. It's just the default place, it's tossing us to.

[Speaker 3]
You stole me. You wench. Anyway.

[Speaker 2]
I can't remember if the huntsman is still in the city or if he broke out. No, he's in the Feywild. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
There's a thing to kill him on Sunday. Saturday. Saturday.

I don't remember seeing that scheduled. Sadly, I don't know what that is, nor do I want to, so.

[Speaker 2]
He has his higher levels, I think. What am I?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it is.

[Speaker 2]
I have level 4s. Right, so I think I should bring Siren on that one. Since we have more players, I think I'll send Charis back.

Um, I can just use Arsonist Goblin today.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, as long as one of them got healings.

[Speaker 4]
What is this healing that you speak of?

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, are we gonna have one of those another things where we're all fucking barbarians?

[Speaker 2]
I hope not.

[Speaker 3]
Do you remember that? All fucking five of us were barbarians. No, I don't remember that either.

Well, you weren't part of it.

[Speaker 2]
Um, was that when we were playing with the weird dude?

[Speaker 3]
No, it was one of the game's chains ran. Um, or like we were all some kind of barbarian multi-class. Like one of them rode a horse, but he was a barbarian multi-class.

[Speaker 2]
God, I have awful memory then, because I don't remember that at all.

[Speaker 3]
Like we beat the shit out of the person, but none of us died, but you know.

[Speaker 4]
I have some drugs. You want some drugs?

[Speaker 2]
What kind of drugs are we talking here?

[Speaker 4]
I got some Pesh.

[Speaker 2]
Pesh? Oh my god.

[Speaker 4]
It's refined.

[Speaker 2]
What character are you bringing?

[Speaker 4]
What character aren't I bringing? I'm gonna bring Hooch.

[Speaker 3]
Hooch? A goblin?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
God, there's gonna be two goblins?

[Speaker 7]
All right, am I audible now? Am I audible now?

[Speaker 5]
One healer character I have that's... Oh yeah, hello.

[Speaker 18]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sweet. So we got a Hooch. Who else we got?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'll drag, um, Castro. Should I, should I drag Bernie as well into the party, or is he just in my shoes?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, you can drag him in there. You drag him in there, so that way if I do the clown car thing, it'll drag everybody in and out. All right, cool.

[Speaker 14]
Who you bringing, Heart? Well, if we need healing, I can bring Minaya. Hell yeah, chaos crew.

All right, let me drag her up there.

[Speaker 7]
Beautiful.

[Speaker 3]
Who's playing for literal pigeons?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, my bad. The premise of this is the, uh...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the little pigeon is the...

[Speaker 1]
Sorry? Yeah, so the dwarves who have been tunneling through the second layer of the hidden bluff, they've been trying to get into some kind of residential district inside of the hidden bluff. Apparently that tunnel finally completed recently, but that has unleashed a ton of rats into the upper levels.

The top level was cleared recently. This will be a short session to go in and kill more rats.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Explore a couple other areas of the dungeon.

[Speaker 3]
Hopefully I can get some rat skins.

[Speaker 2]
And statues. We have 10 rat statues, I think. I think they're in the party stash.

So we got 10 of them, and they... So each rat statue goes into all the other rat statues. They, like, fit together.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. No, you have... You have the rat statues in your inventory.

[Speaker 2]
They're in the party stash.

[Speaker 3]
I don't see them.

[Speaker 2]
Are you clicking on the party stash?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, rat statues. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

I need to equip that one dagger very quickly.

[Speaker 13]
Do you now?

[Speaker 3]
Nope. I'll get to it, though.

[Speaker 1]
Put your, um... Put your silver. Before the session starts.

It was Karas, Arsenas, Goblin, and Big Astro.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... You finally, uh... Did last session, you said I could take it, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, take it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh...

[Speaker 2]
You have, like, one gold and two silver, so... Go for it, buddy.

[Speaker 3]
So, uh... 262. 262.

[Speaker 2]
You can drag it in from the party stash.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, fuck yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

[Speaker 2]
You want us to put our tokens at the door? Oh, okay, you're conking us. Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 16]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Thanks, Astro.

[Speaker 2]
What does your pigeon do? Oh, that's my familiar. That's adorable.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. I thought it would be funny for a bird to have a bird familiar, so... That is really fucking funny.

Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Why is... Why did my, uh... Why did the little love get turned into the rat bite?

[Speaker 7]
I think I was gonna rename it.

[Speaker 1]
The little love was the original rat bite.

[Speaker 3]
I like the name.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's too bad.

[Speaker 3]
I really like... No, no, I like the rat bite. It's...

It makes a lot of sense, thematically, of how I got it.

[Speaker 2]
Change in the description where it says...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, please do.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can attack roll with rat. Bite.

[Speaker 3]
Rat bite. How much damage does it do?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, if you swing it at something, you'll find out.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 7]
That's fair. That's fair. Everybody ready to go?

Any preparations need to be made? Nope.

[Speaker 3]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
All is well. I'm gonna buy a potion, but that's... That's about it.

[Speaker 5]
I just have to make every other spell heal.

[Speaker 4]
I'll give that some, uh... You'll probably give out some potions, too, in KSP.

[Speaker 3]
I don't have anything I need to do yet.

[Speaker 2]
Um, let me check your health.

[Speaker 3]
I think I fixed that last session, but I could be wrong. Thank you, Astro. Er, Froggath, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so it's up to you guys now. Where do you want to go? Mysterio from the second level.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, how do I get to... I don't know how I got... Oh, wait.

There we go! Wait, no.

[Speaker 1]
You better use complete sentences.

[Speaker 3]
I'm stuck on the map! The city map.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, so up at the top? Uh, up at the top, it should say... Hidden glyphs.

Yes, there you go. Where all the other letters are.

[Speaker 3]
Um...

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Kronkar?

[Speaker 3]
We... I think we should go down here. But let me...

[Speaker 2]
Well, we've been down here.

[Speaker 3]
What are you doing? I'm trying to tap. It won't let me tap.

But, like, down here. The opposite of the door that got broken down by the rats.

[Speaker 2]
Right here? No, further down. We've been there.

We've been there.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're looking at... So that's a different floor. That's, like, a top floor.

The first... The entrance to the hidden bluff dungeon has, um... The first row of room has, like, a bisected hallway.

So there's, like, a top level. And then there's a door that also goes down to the next level down. Can you drag me to that map?

[Speaker 4]
I'm from Brunmark.

[Speaker 7]
And I can break it. Sure.

[Speaker 2]
So we can either go left or right.

[Speaker 3]
Why won't it let me... You have to hold the button.

[Speaker 2]
Left.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I mean this area right here. Have we gone here? Yeah, because those goblins have no...

[Speaker 7]
I'm not in that area right now, man.

[Speaker 3]
Well, uh... Fine.

[Speaker 4]
Us goblins have no rights. Let's go left. Yeah, let's go left.

I don't care.

[Speaker 10]
Either way. Ready.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, has anyone got some form of healing?

[Speaker 2]
I have, like, three potions. Oh boy. Birdie!

[Speaker 4]
Mutual add two temporary items of elixir of mind and life for some healing. If people would like to grab one. If you haven't got any healing.

And that essentially lasts until our short rest.

[Speaker 3]
I will take one. If I can figure out how to split them.

[Speaker 2]
You just drag it and it'll give you the option.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. That helps.

[Speaker 11]
There's my balls.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Go ahead and add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 2]
I move, um... Can I move Bernie with me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. In fact, you're going to move yourselves out of the room.

[Speaker 7]
Whatever marching order you wanted.

[Speaker 2]
Arsonist Goblin opened the door, but, um...

[Speaker 3]
Is, uh, any of you guys long range or are you all close range?

[Speaker 4]
Eh, medium.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I can be up close or long range. Okay. And then Bernie's close range, but I want to be careful with him because he's...

He's squishy.

[Speaker 3]
I just want to make sure that I'm ain't gonna be, like, shooting you or anything.

[Speaker 5]
Right, so this order is fine?

[Speaker 3]
Yep. I go in last because I shoot things.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, I shoot you first?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I can go. I'll go right after you then since I can take a hit. What health do you have?

Oh, um, well, 46.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, damn. I only got 15.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so, uh, while I am not technically close range, I'm pretty sure I'm more health than you guys, so I do not mind going first.

[Speaker 2]
Poor Bernie here has 11, and if he dies, he dies. He's not a familiar.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you finally got rat images! Hey!

[Speaker 2]
You have rat bite, don't you?

[Speaker 13]
Yes, you do.

[Speaker 3]
Add yourselves to initiative. Do I need to re-roll it?

[Speaker 7]
You need to add yourself to initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to add yourself? Click on your character. Go navigate onto the left side where it says initiative, and you click on that dice.

[Speaker 3]
Initiative, initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, there you go.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
We'll fix that in a moment. For now, you've got rats.

[Speaker 13]
Haha.

[Speaker 1]
Also misses. Very unfortunate. Bring us to Arsonist Gothel.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean by unfortunate? Maybe for you. I...

I've never used this before. I think I will try it. Well, how much was that?

All right, um... And then I will... I will...

Punch. Punch. Critical miss.

Okay, that's it is my turn. Forgot I could use Bernie, but I'm scared to use him.

[Speaker 1]
We have another close rat. They'll have harnesses on them that with, uh, ticking stopwatches.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Oh no. There's a level like that, or not a level.

There's a place in Fallout 4.

[Speaker 3]
The mole miner and the hospital where you find all the mole barrages. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Okay, that wasn't horrible. Wasn't great though.

[Speaker 7]
It could have been better.

[Speaker 1]
That is its turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, just gonna do a, uh, strike at the guy. One damage. And then he'll need to do a DC-14 save.

[Speaker 3]
We got poisoned?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Hell yeah. I didn't need to get any one of those.

[Speaker 4]
Can you do a, uh, I believe you just pick the DC-18 fort save and then it should roll. If you press the saving throw on it, it should roll. You should do your saving throw on the character.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not seeing the saving throw. But where's that supposed to be? On the blackout of Venom in the chat?

I just see a button that says use.

[Speaker 2]
Um, save and reload DC-18 fort is good.

[Speaker 1]
You just, you just put it back. You should see like above the changes? You just put it back in?

No, okay. All right, so I had to click it and expand it first.

[Speaker 4]
Eee, so it fails. And in this one, I'm going to throw a aqueous fire.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you also have to, let's see here. Does it roll the poison damage for him?

[Speaker 4]
Um, it rolls it on his turn, doesn't it?

[Speaker 11]
There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I've never seen that poison icon. Little spider.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, second. Which one was getting targeted with the, uh?

[Speaker 4]
First one was the bow dart. Second one was the explosion was for that one. Oh, okay.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All creatures within that. All right, this will be fun then. Arsonist Goblin.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Oh boy. Okay.

Did I, did I succeed?

[Speaker 1]
You did succeed. It's this one is the only one that took damage. It's kind of funny.

It's nothing you need to take half. The full damage. Nope, not that one.

It's simple damage.

[Speaker 13]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm using hero point.

[Speaker 8]
I feel like I shouldn't.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. All right. So there goes our first reaction thing there.

Now I could actually have this guy take his turn with the dead rat out of the way. Into attacking Arsonist Goblin.

[Speaker 2]
Poor Arsonist Goblin. They didn't do anything wrong. They served their time in prison.

They don't deserve this. What's a little arson, you know? So true, so true.

[Speaker 1]
And a miss.

[Speaker 2]
I'm stressing. I have two hit points left. Okay.

Is this why I can't...

[Speaker 5]
I have potions of healing, so... I can also heal you with magic, if you prefer. It's my turn.

I hadn't realized that it's on there. Alright.

[Speaker 14]
This is living. I'll hit apply.

[Speaker 9]
Huzzah. Now I have one left, and you're most welcome. And I'll just cast Stoke.

Since you're still in front of me, I'll cast Stoke the Heart. So just... here you go.

And here you go. Alright. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 3]
The gastro. Okay. I will...

Shoot the fuck... Hit T? Yeah, I got it.

I'll hit the hell out of that rat. Fire damage. And then I will use...

One of my actions to reload, and then I'll shoot the shit out of it again. If possible. Um, it's dead, so...

Oh, then I'll move to a different rat. I'll shoot the shit out of this rat. I'm assuming it doesn't have a different AC.

Is the same AC, or do I need to reroll it?

[Speaker 9]
You're fine.

[Speaker 1]
Same AC? Remember your... Same AC, but remember your, um...

Sorry. Remember your multi-attack penalty when it applies.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Sorry about that. No worries.

[Speaker 1]
It's still dead.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 2]
You can hit N2.

[Speaker 1]
We have a final rat.

[Speaker 2]
Yay.

[Speaker 1]
He's still doing that little spell card thing. I get this little pop-up every time I... Do something with any of these rats.

It says, oh, the spell card, couldn't it be fun? It's like, it's not a spell, it's... Well, the module's acting up.

Oh.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, hey, I hit.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Okay, that's not bad. Oh, that's not good.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It is its turn... To go to the top of the round with Orson's Goblet.

[Speaker 14]
That's probably wise.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm gonna... My second and third action is going to be to drink a potion. Okay.

Oh, is it two actions to drink potions? Oh, to get it out and then drink. Ah.

Makes sense. And that is my turn. Bootch.

[Speaker 4]
Bootch's turn. I don't want to be close up. I'm gonna drop my sling.

And then I'm going to...

[Speaker 19]
Sling a shot.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, sorry, I don't do a sling, I throw a dart.

[Speaker 2]
For damage.

[Speaker 12]
And then I'll... I'll throw an Atkins fire for Matt.

[Speaker 4]
My last action. And I'll do a splash damage. So the one next to me will take it as well, too.

There we go, I fixed it. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Well then, time for... Oh, it's only these two that have to... Now remember, you can set splash targets as well.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna do a splash to you as well.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, sorry, I can see... What? Should you splash?

Yeah, no, I can see the splash. You can add those guys to start. Yeah, there you go.

[Speaker 12]
And that is my turn. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. Good job, folks. And I only almost died.

Yay! I'm gonna try my best to use this. I'm gonna treat wounds on myself.

And probably fail, because I have a minus one in wisdom.

[Speaker 10]
Uh, can I search the bodies of the rats?

[Speaker 16]
You may.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, that was... Seek, right? That's...

Eighteen.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing special on these, except for four more rats that you...

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll add those to the stash. Totals out to fourteen that we have.

[Speaker 3]
Can I skin them?

[Speaker 1]
No, they have been exploded. And set on fire. And also exploded.

That's fair.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but...

[Speaker 5]
If we go exploring...

[Speaker 2]
There's a door to our north, and a door to our east.

[Speaker 3]
I vote... Castro votes we go the other way. This way?

Yeah, this way.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay. There's an elevator.

Interesting. Have we been in that elevator before? I don't know why I'm asking.

Arsonist Goblin hasn't been. Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
None of these characters have, I believe. Where did they say the rats all built up to?

[Speaker 1]
Had to shut a door, harass the cat. What was the last question?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I was just asking. So they said the rats were around. I can't remember what they said.

If there was any specific area full of rats that we need to get to.

[Speaker 2]
Think about a tunnel?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so the tunnel is at the... North... Is at the...

Northwest end. Ah, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go this way. Is this room still flooded? Because I remember this was the part where there was land.

[Speaker 1]
Not currently, but there is... Some other stuff in this room.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, northwest is... Up here. So...

If we're going this way, we can take a circle around.

[Speaker 9]
Go up we go. Of course I was.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 17]
And away we go.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy. I need to stop going first. Oh.

It's a chupacabra.

[Speaker 9]
Oh there, it's a chupacabra. It is a chupacabra. They eat goats, do they not?

[Speaker 5]
Might be eating the rats. Oh, never mind it. It seems to have united with the rats.

Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
It's a rat chupacabra.

[Speaker 1]
And add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 9]
We did an uneasy alliance with the chupacabra.

[Speaker 3]
Do you remember how to do that screen? Yep. 24.

[Speaker 4]
Stop it, stop it. Stay in the back.

[Speaker 1]
You can place yourselves... You can place yourselves before the door, since... It would be slightly different.

[Speaker 5]
Um, can you...

[Speaker 3]
Um... Can you sneak as an action?

[Speaker 1]
Wait a second. We're replacing people.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair. There is a sneak exploration action. Is that the marching order?

[Speaker 13]
Uh-huh.

[Speaker 7]
Very good.

[Speaker 1]
First up is an icy rat. Who's up? It rolls to attack.

It, unfortunately, misses. Next is this one. It's turn.

Chupacabra having a little bit...

[Speaker 7]
Oops, not much.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to go for the flank. There's a little bit of damage. And that is...

It's turn. Bring... Bring this to Minaya.

[Speaker 9]
Okey-doke.

[Speaker 5]
I want to see what the range of this spell is real quick. Oh, okay. That would get everything, including myself.

Ignore that. Let me get rid of that.

[Speaker 1]
Unless you place it further in. What is it? Is it an emanation?

[Speaker 5]
It's a burst.

[Speaker 1]
If it's burst, you can place it in the center.

[Speaker 9]
I'll shift... Oh, yeah, you're right.

[Speaker 5]
I'll first move out of the way. Actually, you know what? We're moving out of the way of the burst first.

Let me just... Oopsie-daisy. Let me just move here.

Can I stay in the same place as Arsonist Goblin?

[Speaker 9]
Tiny?

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, sick. And then I'll just place the... Just like this.

Does that hit the Goblin? It hits the Goblin.

[Speaker 1]
Just say that you place it in a way that does not hit you. Because you could just move it. Remember, the burst doesn't have to...

Just move the burst.

[Speaker 5]
And then I'll shift out of the way so I am not in the burst. And then we roll damage. Please make a...

Not you, Arsonist Goblin. Everyone else, please make a saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
Fortitude. If you shift and target, you can target more. Okay.

Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 9]
I think they explode. I did not realize I was vulnerable to Void Damage. Yay!

I didn't realize I was vulnerable to Void Damage.

[Speaker 1]
No, it wasn't vulnerable, it just crippled.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, ow.

[Speaker 8]
Arsonist Goblin takes hit. How much does Manaia take?

[Speaker 5]
Just three. Okay. Oh, it's a Reflex, I forgot.

Whoopsie-daisy. Reflex save. I am selecting the token.

Reflex, roll. Okay. Half of them.

There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Are Manaia's at the end of their turn?

[Speaker 9]
That is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Ficastro.

[Speaker 3]
Ficastro will move over here. And I'm assuming I move up here, so I can see the Chupacabra. And then I try to shoot it.

[Speaker 2]
Target it first.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. Forgot. Now I try to shoot it.

19. 4 damage. And then I will reload.

And the negative, the MAP is the thing I need to use next, right? What's after that? Critical miss.

Yeah. And that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 14]
Chupacabra.

[Speaker 11]
Strength, that's totally fine. Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
Where's this guy? He takes damage.

[Speaker 2]
Holy shit. Oh my god.

[Speaker 13]
Oh god.

[Speaker 2]
How am I doing? Jesus Christ. I'm doing back here.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good idea.

[Speaker 2]
I'm doing back here. I am going to um going to drink a potion. My god.

9. Alright. Uh.

Yeah, that's my go.

[Speaker 11]
We have an explosive rat, which miraculously did not perish.

[Speaker 2]
Leave my Bernie alone.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? He totally is going to go for Bernie.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, screw you. Oh, man.

[Speaker 1]
Rat animosity.

[Speaker 2]
Aha. I shouldn't have said anything.

[Speaker 4]
I want to try push the rat back a bit.

[Speaker 17]
But I don't think I can.

[Speaker 2]
Did we lose heart?

[Speaker 4]
I'm just going to I'm going to I'm going to be an activist fire. And I'm going to droop it up there. Woop.

[Speaker 16]
Oh, very nice.

[Speaker 4]
And So, can I move in the elevator without actually activating it? Yes. Get there.

And I'm going to try lob a I'm going to quick alchemy a light bomb.

[Speaker 16]
Miss. Ah.

[Speaker 4]
Yep, that did that. End of my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Big money. And whammy.

[Speaker 1]
And I have nine damage. And I'm going to use set blood.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no. Which, oh, cool.

[Speaker 4]
That doesn't sound cool.

[Speaker 13]
That's scary.

[Speaker 2]
He's just clicking things.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to use its final Yeah, I'm going to use that to move. It is going to release Mania.

[Speaker 2]
Mania was grabbed?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Is Yeah, so it grabs use drain. Again, the clicking condition, it used that final clicking to actually move.

That is the end of its turn. Bring us to Mania. If Hark is back.

[Speaker 3]
Hark is not back.

[Speaker 12]
This is how we all die.

[Speaker 1]
Who is after Hark? Picastro is after Hark, so Picastro, you will be permitted to take your turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So I'm going to move behind the goblin in hopes that the chupacabra will attack that instead of me, and then I'm going to shoot it. Yeah, reload and shoot.

26. 26. 6 damage.

And that is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
And so you go you move down, you shoot, and you said reload?

[Speaker 3]
No, I move down, I reload, then I shoot.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Oh, right, right, right. Because Dutch was previous.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And then it's Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to have the nine of moons here.

[Speaker 13]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Move down, and use the I That's a once per day, so I don't want to like It's not an easy decision.

[Speaker 19]
Okay, reload.

[Speaker 2]
Do we know if it's blast damage or fire damage?

[Speaker 1]
I believe the sling does not do any fire damage.

[Speaker 2]
It's the exploding part of the rat.

[Speaker 7]
What else is Uh No, that'll be the Now this way with the jaw. Grapple.

[Speaker 11]
Grapple fails. Ah, that sucks. Turn We come now to Arsene's The Charger.

[Speaker 2]
Now my my little dude here has fire immunity. That means he doesn't take any fire damage?

[Speaker 1]
Generally, yeah. That's correct. So you can make the thing explode, and he'll be fine.

Something you could do, because he's not going to There's a tutorial zone, so I'm allowed to do this. If he wanted to set off the explosive the explosive rat Commanding Bernie is two actions, right? I'm sorry, Adam.

Commanding Bernie gives him two actions. He doesn't need to move. You could do the first action on the chupacabra with your best chance to hit And then you could roll to hit the explosive rat with the lower one and have him explode.

Alright, well I will I'm going to hit him pretty easy because he's dead.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll do that. Alright, so just grab him back Miss And try this Got a critical miss.

[Speaker 1]
He's dead, so I'm going to, it's just going to hit.

[Speaker 4]
People talk about him being a dead horse Can't even beat a dead rat. Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
I'm loving the rat on rat violence. Beautiful. Rat wars.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I rolled a one. I pulled for the wrong character but I rolled it.

[Speaker 16]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
He's not doing well. And you still have one action or two actions left?

[Speaker 2]
Two actions, I think, because I did one with him and then the rest, the two, yes, okay. So that will be Hopefully we can see which one does more damage. Okay.

[Speaker 12]
Go to the hagen. Hello.

[Speaker 5]
Haven't made it to the thing yet, but I can go in and turn it out. What has happened in my temple?

[Speaker 9]
Nobody's dead.

[Speaker 5]
That kills it.

[Speaker 2]
You're not completely dead yet. We got one more left. That's the remaining chupacabra.

Ah, sick.

[Speaker 1]
Is it my- I had you move back and and kill the explosive rat with the sling.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, thank you. You can still control her for now as I'm reconfiguring.

[Speaker 19]
No worries. We got one more person before your turn comes up for your next turn.

[Speaker 12]
Unless your heehee is muted. No, I'm not muted. I'll do a sessile bomb.

[Speaker 2]
Fuck him up. Oh, that's beautiful. Smack him.

[Speaker 4]
Smack him?

[Speaker 2]
I think he just needs like a wave.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah, I guess I'll do a another one.

[Speaker 4]
I'll quick alchemy to a blight bomb. Miss. But still takes the splash damage.

Actually, and it didn't add my goblin splash damage to those bombs either, so you should take an extra two.

[Speaker 17]
And then two poison splash. Poison splash will kill them. Very nice.

[Speaker 2]
Good job, James.

[Speaker 4]
Trust me, I had a ton of bombs.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 11]
I'm gonna chip a potion. Kestrel will get a little bit extra. Marshal's gonna as well.

[Speaker 2]
Are you healing? Yes, I heal.

[Speaker 6]
I wanna spend a couple minutes gathering some reagents if possible. Can I ask a question?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, what's up?

[Speaker 3]
Why do different people get different XP values?

[Speaker 2]
If you're a lower level you get higher.

[Speaker 3]
That makes sense.

[Speaker 10]
If you try to get you up there, that makes sense.

[Speaker 2]
It's high risk, high reward. If you wanna bring a level 1 on a level 5.

[Speaker 3]
If you wanna bring your level 1 on a level 10. Oof. Hey, you might get to level 5 in one game.

[Speaker 4]
Nah, it doesn't double for each level, it's only just once. An XP goes to 1000.

[Speaker 2]
And that's 92 out of 1000 right now.

[Speaker 4]
So every level is 1000 experience?

[Speaker 3]
Right, but if you bring a level 1 to a level 10 and you do the entire mission I'm assuming higher level beasts give higher XP. I could be wrong.

[Speaker 1]
No?

[Speaker 3]
They give you the same amount?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Everything's on the same Moving to the next level is always 1000 XP.

[Speaker 4]
It's just that if you fight those same beasts at a higher level, the encounter would be worth less.

[Speaker 3]
So you're saying you could get to level 20 by fighting nothing but rats?

[Speaker 4]
No. Because it goes off the scale of the combat. So if it's like a normal combat or a difficult combat, it might be worth 60.

A hard combat might be worth 90. An extremely severe one might be worth 20. If it's negligible, it'd be no experience.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's a cool system.

[Speaker 2]
We also get XP for social encounters. So if we successfully avoid a fight, we'll get a little bit of XP for that, too. Oh, that's nice.

Alright. Keep going, gang. Oh wait, let's search the body.

[Speaker 1]
Well, some people are healing, some people are looking for reagents.

[Speaker 2]
I'll wait, yeah. And we gotta look for the rat statues.

[Speaker 3]
That's what I was gonna do. But I can wait for everybody to heal.

[Speaker 4]
You can do that. It takes 10 minutes for us to heal.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I thought he was saying about rolling. Okay. I got 21.

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 1]
I think he's away from his computer.

[Speaker 2]
He's not. I also have the plaster thingy. Healing plaster.

[Speaker 4]
Plaster is just a replacement for medical tools.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, and I love it, because I can just scoop up a pile of mud and slap it on a wound, like a bear.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, you'd be right, mate. Get that guy.

[Speaker 6]
What's the difference between concealing an object and palming an object? I don't know. Concealing it is hiding it, where palming is trying to steal it.

Ah.

[Speaker 4]
So if you have a blade on you and you wanna hide it, that'd be concealing it, where palming and hiding it is they have a blade and you wanna steal it.

[Speaker 3]
But isn't palming something you do in magic to hide your card?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Uh, no. That's the term they use here, is palming.

[Speaker 3]
I think.

[Speaker 6]
You palm your card.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe it's, um...

[Speaker 3]
Like, it obviously could be different wording and pathfinder, it's just I find that kind of interesting.

[Speaker 6]
I find this stuff interesting. And it does have a card on it. Exactly.

Uh, my my rogue has what does he have?

[Speaker 2]
Um... He's got cards that are like metal, doesn't he?

[Speaker 3]
You can throw them.

[Speaker 2]
He has marked playing cards.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's fucking evil.

[Speaker 2]
Uh-huh, and I I also have a gambler friend.

[Speaker 6]
Fuck you. Uh, fuck, I got like an hour in me and then I gotta go. Why don't you go have a coffee?

[Speaker 10]
A coffee doesn't work for me and I got ADHD. Caffeine makes me tired.

[Speaker 2]
I have a caffeine addiction, so caffeine doesn't do anything except for fend off headaches.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, exactly. That too.

[Speaker 4]
I have a house inspection soon, waiting for it today, and um apparently we're not allowed to eat in any room outside of the kitchen or the dining room.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, a house inspection? Yeah. Because of renting.

Oh, oh, okay. We won't be coming up soon, too.

[Speaker 4]
And so I want a snack, but I can't have food in the room when they do the inspection.

[Speaker 3]
I was thinking for a second that I thought, oh shit, this guy's getting investigated by the authorities, but no, it's just I'm playing in prison.

[Speaker 4]
Just waiting for you.

[Speaker 6]
We're gonna have to house. You just got out of prison. My cousin went to prison.

Did mine. Not a fun thing.

[Speaker 3]
Well, yeah, but when you spend $20,000 a week on hookers and strippers, it's I'd say going to prison for a year or two is worth it.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know, man.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like that would make me be like really, uh, because that's all I'm going to be thinking about in prison. I gotta get back out there and do that again.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. He's a straight shooter now. He's a very, very, I wouldn't say pious man, but he is, uh, he's changed.

[Speaker 2]
He does not want to go through that again. That's what you're trying to say.

[Speaker 3]
He doesn't want to go through $20,000 down the drain in a weekend.

[Speaker 6]
That man taught me how to drive.

[Speaker 4]
Especially when you can do it cheaper overseas.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, God.

[Speaker 4]
You do it in Mexico, it would have only cost you two.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's my question. Oh, cool. I can put this here again.

Are you able to divide the gold for it? Oh, you put a bunch of stuff in. Okay.

I'm still trying to figure out what he put in there. You can click it. That's what I did.

Underwater. Print spell gun. Where's he putting this stuff?

I don't see anything. There's a treasure chest. Oh.

Anglerfish lantern. How do I access it? There we go.

Double click it. Oh. Hooch, there's a bomb for you.

There's a spell gun.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I have to take this underwater thing.

[Speaker 3]
I heard gun.

[Speaker 2]
The underwater rune thing is for Kneeback. I'm taking it. You can have everything else.

[Speaker 3]
What's this? Gun? I heard gun.

If you want it, you can have it.

[Speaker 4]
It's for a different character. It's in chat. So, a counter shows a torrent spell gun is a dint to the touch.

See, we'd repped this creep. You activate the spell gun by aiming it once at the creature making choices, spell attack or fire.

[Speaker 6]
That doesn't sound interesting. I'll stick with normal guns.

[Speaker 4]
It's a rune I one time used to kill someone.

[Speaker 2]
Is that a rune? The underwater thing?

[Speaker 6]
The underwater thing is a rune.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. I can pay 75 after this to get it put on my flamethrower?

[Speaker 1]
You would have to pay 75. 75 is the value of the rune.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. It's like 3 silver per day or something. Per day, what do you mean?

Per day of work. We were trying to figure out how many days of work it would How many days of work does it take to put a rune on something? Would one gold cover it?

The angular fish lantern sounds interesting, but I don't really need anything. So transferring the rune takes a day.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you wanted, you could leave your flamethrower with one of the dwarves upstairs. That's where the rune cover is right now.

[Speaker 2]
How much? It's 51, I guess?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's the raw price is like for a hireling and then it's 6 silver.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so I'm only spending 6 silver. Alright, cool.

[Speaker 2]
And then my alchemist flamethrower. Oh, does that even have can I put something on that?

[Speaker 6]
A flamethrower isn't typically a weapon.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't think I can even put one on that.

[Speaker 6]
I'm not opposed to putting a rune on it. What effect the rune might have on it though. It's um we'll need to figure that out right this second because it's going to take a day of downtime to get it on there anyways.

Is anybody taking the anglerfish lantern? Or angelfish lantern? It looks interesting.

I'll probably just use it as a normal lantern. Are you taking the bomb pooch? I guess so.

Like I'm happy with taking just my share of gold.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not.

[Speaker 2]
So you also have Minaya to think about.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
If we sell the angelfish lantern we get an extra 75 gold to split between us.

[Speaker 3]
I'm hard at reading. I don't really know what it does. I just know it looks interesting to me.

[Speaker 2]
They're stylized after an anglerfish or made from a taxidermied anglerfish. It can be lit as usual. The anglerfish lantern automatically shines when submerged in water.

All creatures within the bright light of the anglerfish lantern must succeed a will save or be fascinated by the light for one round or one minute on a critical failure. The fascination ends if the light is extinguished. Aquatic animals and creatures with the water trait take negative two circumstance penalties to this check.

Regardless of the results, the creature then becomes immune to the effect for 24 hours.

[Speaker 3]
So does it only work underwater? The effect or does it work?

[Speaker 2]
I think it only works underwater.

[Speaker 3]
I've never gone underwater.

[Speaker 4]
And the worst aspect is it affects allies and enemies.

[Speaker 1]
There are accessory rooms for stuff like this.

[Speaker 6]
So you just have this be like an underwater accessory room. Yeah. Yeah, we can sell it if no one wants it.

[Speaker 10]
I'm a cowboy. I don't really play. I'm a cowboy mercenary bodyguard.

I don't really plan on going underwater.

[Speaker 6]
Well, even underwater in this dungeon. Probably enough time for like another encounter or two.

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Yeah, I'm down for another encounter or two. As long as they aren't like big boss fights.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Let's go up here then.

[Speaker 4]
The big boss fights are where the loot's at.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but man, my brain won't function for another boss fight. I'm blinking my eyes individually.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I don't have my belt. How do I um...

[Speaker 2]
Is there a button I can press to make my rat stay on top of my character?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, if you select your rat and then if you right click on it and then the icon to the left, which is like the dot and then point up and that'll bring your character to the front.

[Speaker 2]
So if you ever go on top of anything I mean like, can I make it so they move on one go? They move at the same time? Well, just while we're playing around and stuff.

[Speaker 6]
R or N? Whatever, I can just do it manually. It's fine.

It can be part of the game. Eventually I want to give it like a devil thingy. Give it a pistol.

Theoretically. I think there is something that's supposed to let you take it with you. It's fine.

We probably aren't going to be moving around too much anyway before the next fight. Speaking of the next fight, where are you guys heading to next?

[Speaker 2]
North and then we're going to go up and then to the left.

[Speaker 6]
And here there is a room. A dead end. Moving everything to the party sheet?

I hope that's okay. So this room is is...spoilers. Got it, got it. We will go down and then out.

The other option is if you hold left click and select both of them when you move, you'll move both at the same time as well too. If you're lost. We go into this room?

I don't want to go too far without your input.

[Speaker 2]
While he's rolling things.

[Speaker 3]
This is going to be a fucking tarrasque.

[Speaker 2]
I forgot this is a dungeon and there are traps in dungeons.

[Speaker 3]
It's a tarrasque. We all die. There's a chest on the far end of the room.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well, if somebody doesn't stop Arsonist Goblin they will just walk right into a trap.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, cool. Castro would say, Arsonist Goblin, look at the shiny!

[Speaker 2]
We're going to it.

[Speaker 4]
But does a shiny go boom?

[Speaker 2]
How much damage do I take? I have a negative 1 to wisdom. I have high intelligence but knowledge can only get you so far.

[Speaker 16]
Go ahead and add yourselves to initiative.

[Speaker 2]
Perfect. I'm dead. I'm scared.

I'm in danger. I don't think I would still have that. So I'm going to get rid of that.

Are we keeping Linaya?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Heart back? Oh, not yet.

Heart is typing, though.

[Speaker 2]
Typing fiercely, it would seem.

[Speaker 16]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to move Bernie over?

[Speaker 2]
Nope, I want to keep Bernie away.

[Speaker 4]
Bernie Sanders.

[Speaker 2]
Bernie stays at the back of the party. Bernie's in the other room. Slightly on the other side of the wall.

Oh yeah, he's under Hooch.

[Speaker 11]
I getcha.

[Speaker 6]
So a tunnel.

[Speaker 1]
Well, so a few things have happened. First, a portcullis, which is like a gate that falls down from the top. That's fallen between Arsonist Goblin and the rest of the party.

[Speaker 6]
There is a switch next to the door indicated like that. Is there anything even in the chest? There is.

I'll do that between turns.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. I will take your word for it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no. The final thing of note is that two tunnels have opened up inside the same room as you.

[Speaker 6]
The door next to you swings open. Oh. Okay.

Hooch is smart. Hooch stays back. Hooch stays out.

Hooch stays alive. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
We begin the encounter.

[Speaker 14]
There we go. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Now don't worry, because the portcullis is separating you two.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Perfect. Cool.

I'll just stay in my little bubble here. Can I shoot through it with my fire?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, yeah. That was open enough. I think that was a miss.

[Speaker 8]
Critical miss. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
I guess it sees me when I walk by. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
They go sprinting out on all fours and...

[Speaker 2]
How brave our characters have to be. You wouldn't find me dead in a situation like this. Actually, I would be dead in a situation like this.

Hooch.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. I'm going to quick alchemy. And I'm going to move away.

And that is my turn. Reasonable. Well, that's two bombs.

That's how I get it. Now run away.

[Speaker 12]
Here we have...

[Speaker 16]
Maniah.

[Speaker 1]
Attempt to paralyze him. Did he take the fire damage? He took...

He did not take the fire damage. Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
And then he'd only be taking the splash damage from the acid. Or poison.

[Speaker 1]
I believe... Damage. And then he takes the splash damage as well.

To do that, I really need to set these splash targets. Don't set the splash targets. Put the thing down the bottom.

No, I have to. The thing at the bottom doesn't automatically hit him.

[Speaker 4]
Oh no. I took that splash damage.

[Speaker 13]
Pardon?

[Speaker 4]
Nothing. I was trying to add it to the splash damage, but it made me take the damage.

[Speaker 1]
No, no. So there's a little thing that lets you set the target. It's a button that says set splash targets.

And you click that when you have them targeted. Alright, so Maniah tried to paralyze him. That did not work.

And that was not successful. Alright, so that's totally fine. Success.

Oh, hey. The target is still stunned one, though. For one round.

[Speaker 11]
It's Maniah's turn.

[Speaker 3]
Ficastro. Uh... Ficastro will move behind the goblin.

Hitch will hide behind Hitch. And shoot this this chupacabra. That's a miss.

And then I will reload, and that is my turn. Except they're leaving you behind. Arsonist goblin.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Bye.

[Speaker 18]
There is now loot in there, by the way.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, perfect.

[Speaker 1]
That hits.

[Speaker 2]
I don't want Barney to die. I gotta use him sometime. I can revive him if he goes down, right?

[Speaker 1]
You can heal him if he goes down.

[Speaker 2]
Like, I mean, can I pay to have him resurrected? He's got eleven hit points.

[Speaker 1]
I think so, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Alright, buddy. You go.

You did it, boy. No!

[Speaker 14]
Okay. That is rough.

[Speaker 7]
Another chupacabra.

[Speaker 12]
Chupacabra.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty...

[Speaker 2]
Very...

[Speaker 1]
Very humble. Bastard.

[Speaker 2]
He's crit fail. That was not a crit fail.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait. Nope. Sorry.

That was...

[Speaker 18]
B-roll. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
All the way down, and go for the back line. Oh, I'm fucked. Wipe out you.

[Speaker 3]
Uh-huh, yeah. I'm fucked. Off to the explosive rats.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. Begin moving through the tunnels. Arsonist Goblin's special space here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, if you guys could just open that door. Actually, if I could just open the door. There would be no choice.

[Speaker 1]
Hitting a miss.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just gonna open the door when it's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
A miss and a hit. To the top of the round, Chupacabra starts only having two actions. I think what I need to do is grabbing the drain.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, no! Wait, can he suck the blood of an elemental?

[Speaker 1]
You know what? Give me a sec. Does he have his immunities to fire?

Ah, interesting. Oh, there's a support benefit, too. If you're hitting people while your fire elemental is nearby, it deals an additional persistent fire damage.

[Speaker 2]
How close is nearby?

[Speaker 1]
If they're...

[Speaker 2]
If you...

[Speaker 1]
Your strikes damage a creature within the reach of your fire elemental, so if you did that to him...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
He's within reach. So it needs to use its action to the support action, and it can't attack while doing it.

[Speaker 13]
Mhm.

[Speaker 1]
I don't see anything... This is just because I'm unfamiliar with the companions. I don't see anything that says he's immune to bleed in here, which would be one reason to not let him do it.

I think he is going to do that, and then he'll let Bernie go through here.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, Hooch. Hooch is going to target the one nearby. And he's going to throw an alchemist's fire.

Miss. And he's going to do another alchemist's fire. Miss.

This isn't good. And then I run up here towards the little lever. And that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Malaya! He's not here.

[Speaker 13]
Heal?

[Speaker 1]
Heal the caster.

[Speaker 13]
Fuck yeah!

[Speaker 1]
Good work. How many hit points can you have to begin with? I can have 15.

[Speaker 10]
I have 4. So I need 11.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
There you go. Thank you. Big, big ups.

Big thank.

[Speaker 1]
Then we're going to cast Stoke the Heart on... Ah, that's so cool. Casting Stoke the Heart on Mr. Hooch.

[Speaker 11]
Gains... 2 plus...

[Speaker 1]
And we will put that on you as well, giving you some temporary HP. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I will shoot this fucker. That's the wrong thing.

Sorry. Miss. And then I will reload and I'm fucking running.

And that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Has the door been open?

[Speaker 12]
No, the door's not been open.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. And I'm sitting here with exploding rats. Um...

[Speaker 4]
The Doppler should be resistant to fire.

[Speaker 19]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 2]
I guess I could go to like right there and get those guys.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is funny. So you are...

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 11]
Oops.

[Speaker 1]
Gotta make me some saves. The explosive harness explodes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, so it was the fucking box too. God damn it. Does the box explode?

[Speaker 1]
So the first one succeeded. Use the little thing.

[Speaker 2]
Little thing?

[Speaker 1]
Oh! Alright, so you succeeded both.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Did I explode the box?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so you take half of these.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I take half and then minus one. That was the alchemist's fire, wasn't it?

[Speaker 1]
No, they're exploding rats, they explode.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I set fire to this, or you know, I hit the box so I just assumed that it was the fucking alchemist's fire exploding in there. Which would be really funny. Ugh.

[Speaker 8]
I did not check to see if this would explode. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Please explode, that would be so funny.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but your character might die.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, my character might die, but I have a rat. I can play as a rat the rest of the session. That's true.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you can just get reincarnated. You can entrust one of the people in your party to reincarnate you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, revive.

[Speaker 1]
Same thing. The chest is gonna be just fine. Alright, do you have any other what was that, a move in there?

[Speaker 2]
No, I think I moved an inch backwards, so I'll count that as movement.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. We're officially in the same square.

[Speaker 2]
Halfway in the same square. I guess I could command Bernie here. I could command Bernie.

Bernie.

[Speaker 11]
That's it.

[Speaker 2]
Fight him, Bernie. Alright. Chupacabra.

He's gonna eat Bernie, or Mediah. We'll see.

[Speaker 8]
I fuckin' ran.

[Speaker 3]
I'm squishy.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
Does that kill Mediah?

[Speaker 1]
Mediah's not doing so hot.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, oh no. Please get me out of here. I can heal.

[Speaker 1]
Let me add the grab condition. Grab.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna die. We're all gonna die. Oh, I'm not gonna die.

[Speaker 13]
I'm gonna die.

[Speaker 14]
Great. Hi, heart. I'm gonna die.

Go ahead and kill me. Oh no. Hello.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I found a restaurant with Wi-Fi, so.

[Speaker 3]
You have to go to a different You have to go to a restaurant?

[Speaker 5]
It's out of power, so I have to find somewhere. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 2]
James, James, why? James, please. Please, please, please, please.

That's great.

[Speaker 1]
That's fantastic. That's all. You don't even have to roll damage.

[Speaker 2]
You don't have to roll damage. Okay. I'm down, I'm down.

I'll be there in a moment. Mediah, you need to focus on yourself. You're near death.

[Speaker 3]
You need to focus on yourself.

[Speaker 2]
It's been an hour. Can I have a hero point to stabilize myself?

[Speaker 1]
You're going to need it, because you're starting at dying too.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, damn.

[Speaker 1]
You went down too quickly.

[Speaker 2]
That is so rude, James. That's so rude. Why would you do this to me?

I thought we were friends.

[Speaker 1]
You understand that's like the least likely way that you could go. I missed. I critically missed twice.

But I had actual bonuses. And then the last one, no bonus. Practically no way I was going to hit you, unless I had a true spot here.

[Speaker 4]
Jesus Christ. That was easy. I found a cancer.

[Speaker 1]
Found you again for once. Go ahead and roll.

[Speaker 3]
Everybody go ahead and hero point. Spend over an hour. I don't know how to do that.

Ah, don't worry. You're fine.

[Speaker 2]
You're fine. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
You don't get your sucky sucky sucky on the goblin. Just a little bit of damage.

[Speaker 2]
No suck for you. No big suck.

[Speaker 4]
I'm running low on things to throw.

[Speaker 3]
Poke it. Poke it to death.

[Speaker 4]
Let's try some acid.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, nice. Critical.

[Speaker 4]
Kills it. Yeah. He's like, drink this.

And starts pouring some acid on it. It's going to come down here. Why do I have so many 0 out of 0 bombs?

Why doesn't it remove it? Gonna... Grow a bomb down there.

Miss. How do you send a press to add an... Splash.

There we go. No, no. It should just be 2 damage.

It should? Ah. Yeah, I didn't think I...

I didn't apply the persistent poison damage. It would only just be the 2 base damage. And the splash.

[Speaker 1]
I don't... I don't understand the difference here. So, what do you want me to do?

[Speaker 4]
It wouldn't apply the 2d4 persistent damage. So I'm not sure... So you just take off the persistent damage.

So any damage it would take from that strike would be the 2 splash damage.

[Speaker 1]
So it didn't hit?

[Speaker 4]
No, it was a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Ah. Any other action? I don't think so.

[Speaker 16]
How about Diah?

[Speaker 5]
Hello. Is my familiar on the board, or can I just not see them with the statuses covering everything?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know where your familiar is.

[Speaker 5]
That's fine. I'll just back and drop them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, didn't you use your familiar last session?

[Speaker 1]
What? That's not a thing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry. Wrong person. Wrong person.

Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
You said you'd be on next turn.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That was a pretty big hit. Let's see. You took 13 damage.

[Speaker 5]
Then I'll probably survive another one. Let's go heal stuff. This is why we carry several wands.

Where are the other creatures? Anyway. Wand of Harm.

Ha! Yippee. I should probably roll against the more injured critters.

Wrong... So that other people can come help me. Failure!

Yay! Alright. Roll damage.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. If you had just rolled damage, it would have been the same. That's fine.

[Speaker 5]
Hold on. Okay. It should have only been a single action, because it doesn't do extra damage by using two.

So one more action to try and get this guy. Do I have any other cool things I can use? I do not.

Who's next on the thing?

[Speaker 1]
Well, soon it's going to be Ficastro, and then it looks like the Chupacabra will go, and then the remaining explosive rat will kill Archivist Goblin.

[Speaker 14]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
He'll kill. Oh, no. If I...

Can I give you... Have you used your hero point to fix yourself?

[Speaker 2]
I have not stabilized yet, no. The problem is, explosive rat goes before...

[Speaker 3]
Oops, it's going to fuck up. Can I stabilize her? If you could get to her.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to give you guidance for that. Hold on. I'm going to give you guidance for that.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have any kind of medical anything?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, let me check. Right now? He has a healing potion you took.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I have a healing potion. I gave him that earlier on. Is this gate open?

It's not open.

[Speaker 5]
I do have healing, but I can't reach you with it. Not right now.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if I'll be able to get to her.

[Speaker 1]
I just said, it's not open, but you need a healing potion, because you're just reaching her.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so I can feed it to her through the bars? Sure. Will that take one turn or two turns?

Or two points?

[Speaker 4]
One turn of draw, one turn of fade, one turn of move.

[Speaker 3]
I'll do that, then I'll end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
It would be two if you just did it from here. Just use a thin black bead.

[Speaker 3]
ScienceSats2020, how do I do the healing potion?

[Speaker 2]
Go into your inventory. And click use on the healing potion, and then at the bottom it'll say use, and then I can click that. Let me do that on mine.

It'll get rid of dying too, but I get wounded too?

[Speaker 4]
That's correct. So you get... You're not wounded one though, right?

It's only... Wounded one. So wounded increases by when you go back up.

Only by one.

[Speaker 1]
Right, dying increases by your wounded value, but not the other way around. I've got one action left.

[Speaker 3]
Oh shit. Fuck. Uh...

I'll shoot a rat. 29 critical hit. Uh, 19.

[Speaker 7]
Very dead. Very dead to Robin.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, Chupacabra. Great, you're still grabbed. So we're gonna suck blood.

Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Great. Let you go. Move.

[Speaker 1]
Calls with a miss. Wipe with a hit. That is the end of its turn.

Then we have the final explosive rat. Here with Arsonist Goblin. That's a miss.

That's a miss. That's also a miss. Arsonist Goblin.

[Speaker 2]
Arsonist Goblin. Um... Is the door open?

I need to get up.

[Speaker 18]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Well then. Great. I'm on my own.

Yay, I get poor fucking healing. That was a mistake. I can do it again, actually.

I can do it three times. Fuck it. Oh, I'm gonna do it two times.

Actually, ignore that. I can take a potion out and fucking drink it. No, cause that was one action to...

Um, well, I don't have that anymore. How does that work? Shouldn't that auto-factor in?

[Speaker 1]
Ah!

[Speaker 2]
Okay. It won't let me. I don't know why it won't let me do that.

I enabled it, but it didn't do anything.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I see. So burn it. If burn it is on, then it doesn't do the healing thing.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, was burn it on?

[Speaker 1]
For some reason burn it was on. When I clicked roll damage slash healing, burn it was on.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so add an eight for a two-action one?

[Speaker 1]
It's plus one per rank of the spell each time you do it.

[Speaker 2]
Put in the chat if you wish to make it a two-action for the heal that I just did instead of two separate actions, then just add plus eight to your health. I guess I'll just do that then instead of doing two separate weak ones.

[Speaker 11]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that'll be my go.

[Speaker 4]
Oops! Gonna do this one. Um, gonna do ghost charge.

Vitality only hurts that I'm dead, doesn't it? When these guys are only weird looking. Hmm.

I'm also nearly dead. I'll drink a potion as one action. That did not help as much as I thought it would.

And I guess I'm gonna do my last quick alchemy to create a bomb.

[Speaker 1]
Anything else to get through? Nope, that's it. Manaia.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, gang. Uh, Nibak, are you still stuck in the, um, thing?

[Speaker 2]
I am still very much stuck.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, you'll take too many actions from me, but I can send my familiar to attempt to get you out of there. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I have two people standing over here, but nobody thought to just open it.

[Speaker 3]
I had planned to open it next round, but that's metagaming. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, does it require to be unlocked or just regular opening?

[Speaker 4]
Just need someone to pull the lever.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, well, I can just send my bird to do it? Yeah, go ahead. The familiar does that for you.

[Speaker 1]
Where's the familiar?

[Speaker 5]
Manual dexterity. Um, it's, uh, there.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there we go. Move the bird where the, uh, lever is, which is on this side.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, okay. It just, it pulls the lever. It has manual dexterity, so it's able to- It pulls the lever!

And, uh, while I'm doing that, it pulls the lever!

[Speaker 2]
What none of you could do for- Ah! What? Multiple rounds.

[Speaker 13]
Three times.

[Speaker 2]
What, it's trapped? That is evil, James. What is wrong with you?

[Speaker 16]
Oh, good lord.

[Speaker 12]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so you can attempt to grab So you guys can attempt to, uh, use your reaction to grab the edge? Uh, what was that?

[Speaker 2]
Ah!

[Speaker 1]
Carefully.

[Speaker 2]
Castro, alright. Click the little, the little circle button next to, um, next to, not circle, the little, two little arrows going into each other beside where you just rolled.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Click it, and hit, um, H, the re-roll using Hero Point.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
There you go. What is- Um. Pitfall.

What is, uh, reflex? Okay, so do you see the word reflex in the pitfall thing?

[Speaker 1]
Uh-huh.

[Speaker 2]
Select that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he's already, he's already got it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Alright, cool.

[Speaker 1]
And he re-rolled with, uh, so you're both hanging on to the edge right now. Uh, my impression is that hurt by a spike strike, a falling creature can attempt to grab an edge. Yeah, so my understanding is that you you grab onto the edge before you take any kind of damage or get hit by- That would make sense.

If you're grabbing the edge, you don't get hit by a spike.

[Speaker 5]
Is, uh, Nibak free?

[Speaker 1]
Is who?

[Speaker 5]
Arsonist Goblin.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, right. Uh, Nibak- I keep thinking of, uh, Nibak for some reason. Uh, Arsonist Goblin is not free.

The board call is still right there.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, okay, it was a double trap.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's evil.

[Speaker 1]
You can blame Matt Cole for this one. I wanted to do this for, like, ten years.

[Speaker 5]
And it's evil. It's extremely funny, don't worry. Still.

[Speaker 3]
Evil, but funny.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, exactly. I was like, wow, it's just, it's never gonna happen, I guess. There's no- Alright, they got out of it.

Oh yeah, so what would you like to do with the rest of your turn?

[Speaker 4]
And you guys are like, why isn't anyone triggered this trap for the last two rounds?

[Speaker 1]
Right. I mean, you weren't doing that because you knew it was a trap. You were just not doing it because you were focusing something else.

[Speaker 3]
It would have been so good to trigger that trap right at the beginning.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, did I suspect it was a trap? The whole time?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I don't know, and that's true. That's true, I can't really accuse you of that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, well, I'm going to help Hooch with that.

[Speaker 17]
Not anymore.

[Speaker 5]
How's the health?

[Speaker 18]
I just thankfully dumped milk at him. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Hooch, Hooch, take the health. Sick, awesome. And I have one more action left in which I...

Let's see. You get extra damage from this. We're doing Stoke the Heart yet again.

And you also get temporary hit points from that. Okay. Your turn.

[Speaker 3]
My turn?

[Speaker 1]
Hey Castro, who's the person who grabs the edge? Scroll back up. Oh, you know what?

Because it'll say what's going on. Okay, when you fall, something, something, your thing, if you grab the edge you can then climb up using Athletics.

[Speaker 3]
So I need to roll another Athletics?

[Speaker 1]
Right inside. I put it inside the chat. Go ahead and click that.

[Speaker 3]
14.

[Speaker 1]
I think you do not move. You can attempt again though.

[Speaker 3]
I will attempt again.

[Speaker 1]
24. That's easy. Alright, so you could go up into the doorway.

[Speaker 3]
Which way? This way? Okay.

That was great. Ow, fuck! My knee!

So do I have one turn left? Yeah, I jacked up my knee. Do I have one turn left or did I use all my turns?

My points?

[Speaker 1]
You do have one. Yeah, you have one remaining. There is...

There is a... There's another lever on the side.

[Speaker 3]
I will... I will move over here. Oh, I'm gonna fuckin' check first.

If I can.

[Speaker 1]
Next turn, you certainly can.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, next turn.

[Speaker 5]
Do you still have guidance?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Hooch, you are currently... Do you have a climb speed, Hooch?

[Speaker 4]
Hooch does not have a climb speed, no.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Hooch is off guard then. Let's grab you. Let's do it again.

Jesus. Alright, you're unconscious. And do I fall?

Nope, because he is grabbing you.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, how gracious of him.

[Speaker 1]
Yay.

[Speaker 16]
Did it move you above? It did, it did.

[Speaker 1]
My only option now is I have to drag you. Or else he loses his beetle.

[Speaker 13]
Uh oh.

[Speaker 1]
That's all my action. I tried to hit you and I missed. Uh, then I crit you and did the grab.

[Speaker 6]
And then I move.

[Speaker 1]
Arsonist I'm gonna attack you.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, I fixed it. It's arsonist.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, now I look... Your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 11]
I'm gonna take prone off you. There we are.

[Speaker 2]
Killzoo. And my third action is the door open? Is it open or am I still trapped?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's not open.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool. I will... I'll sit right here.

[Speaker 1]
You can command burning. You can open the loot box.

[Speaker 2]
I can't open the loot box. I'll take one alchemist fire out of it. Actually, that's...

[Speaker 1]
There is a lever in the bottom of the loot box.

[Speaker 2]
There is?

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well then I'll take that and shove it into whatever hole I see.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's just you pull it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, nevermind. Yeah, I'll do that.

[Speaker 1]
This one opens.

[Speaker 2]
Thank god. Oh, for fuck's sake.

[Speaker 1]
This one closes.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, so now he's stuck?

[Speaker 8]
That is correct.

[Speaker 2]
He ain't me, so he's fine. We'll figure it out. Who else is alive?

[Speaker 13]
Midai.

[Speaker 5]
Hello, things are happening. Hooch is about to get eaten. Icemaskoblin, how are you faring?

[Speaker 2]
I'm alright. Ignore me. Focus on Hooch.

[Speaker 5]
The lever that was pulled over here... Does that trigger a difference?

[Speaker 3]
It hasn't been pulled yet.

[Speaker 1]
The one next to Picastro hasn't been pulled yet. The big thing right now is that Hooch is going to die. Unless the Trooper Copper peels off to kill somebody else instead.

Which it might, because you're right there.

[Speaker 16]
What are we thinking, Midai? We may have muted...

[Speaker 8]
But I think Heart lost connection.

[Speaker 13]
Yep. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I did lose connection. Hello, we're back. Welcome back.

Thank you. While Foundry's reloading, I am planning on healing Hooch, and then I'm going to sustain with Tackle, just so that he can get the extra hit points back. And then Needle of Vengeance the weird Koopa, Koopa Trooper.

Preach the Goat Eater.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we're going to second-rank heal.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, here we go. I'm back. Yes, okay.

I can deal with that.

[Speaker 7]
Very good.

[Speaker 5]
Second-rank heal.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 5]
Great. He's healing yourself, Hooch. And then with our remaining act...

Alright, so first... Here you go, enjoy that. Then we're going to Needle of Vengeance this nerd.

Please make the will save. Ah, hippie. Well, I can still give someone a bit of health, so this next one should be good too.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it looks like each time... It's each time he uses a hostile action, he has to make the save.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I was just giving something to...

[Speaker 3]
Okay. What do I have to roll to assess this lever? To see if it's a trap.

[Speaker 1]
I would roll something like Thievery. Oh, hold on. Let's see what the basic action macros have to say.

I would roll to disarm.

[Speaker 10]
Disarm, disarm, disarm.

[Speaker 1]
Regular or Agile? The same bonus. But you would start with dis...

Wait, no. Disarm... Am I stupid?

Disarm is for like take away weapons.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah. Why am I thinking of...

[Speaker 4]
Be disabled device?

[Speaker 1]
I guess. Is that in the basic action macros? I'm not sure.

Yeah. Alright. Then he doesn't have it because he's not trained.

[Speaker 13]
Oh.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. The thingy for it.

[Speaker 4]
What's it? Disable device. It would be like a Thievery check.

If you're trying to disable it, but find him out. I don't know what you'd want to do for that, whether it's risk hole knowledge or Thievery.

[Speaker 1]
Untrained, untrained. Yeah, I think it just straight up doesn't have anything for this.

[Speaker 10]
So that's a no on accessing it. So, um...

[Speaker 1]
The best I can think of is like a generic risk hole knowledge, but I don't think I'll just pull it.

[Speaker 3]
If I die, I die. I can get revived.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Rolling boulder appears on this side. Fun.

And begins rolling towards the palace. This is the side that has the tunnel behind it. And the portcullis is between you and the boulder.

So can I run this way? The portcullis is between you and the boulder. You can begin running down the tunnel, but this will be the final encounter of the night.

So... We gotta keep moving.

[Speaker 13]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Um... No longer die.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, stand up. I'm gonna... Am I still grappled by him?

Yes. Try to put it in a face. And then I'm gonna try to escape.

Um... Blim. And I'm gonna try to escape again.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So hold on, you threw a bomb at him, and then you used the escape action, and then you...

[Speaker 4]
Escape action twice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So you're still gonna be hero-prone, just no longer grab. You go for the next blooded person.

[Speaker 8]
Miss? Bullshit.

[Speaker 5]
It's also going to have to do a couple will saves.

[Speaker 1]
Is it... Are the will saves versus you, or against, uh... Hooch?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, uh... Hooch gets attacked?

[Speaker 1]
I'm attacking you?

[Speaker 5]
Well, it was against Hooch because he was in its grasp, so... It's, uh... It's free range for me.

[Speaker 16]
One thing...

[Speaker 1]
Good chance I can take you both down. I think it's gonna stay, I just don't know... What'll I do?

So if I'm quickened, do I just, uh... Keep using the last multi-attack penalty there? Yeah.

Alright.

[Speaker 8]
Arsonist.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Uh... I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Uh...

[Speaker 13]
You got Bernie.

[Speaker 2]
I got Bernie.

[Speaker 1]
And if you move here, you'll be able to shoot the chupacabra. That's it.

[Speaker 2]
Go, Bernie, go! How's it looking?

[Speaker 8]
Worse.

[Speaker 2]
I'll use my third action to give it an extra action.

[Speaker 7]
Nah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait.

[Speaker 2]
Can I?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you can? Yeah. How does it work?

So you...

[Speaker 4]
So you could use a command action? So the first one you can... Yeah, so the first one is like a command, and you get a bonus.

You can do one action for their twos. And then you can use a substantial action to give it an additional action.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Alright.

[Speaker 4]
There is... It doesn't stack with Mature Animal Companion. And...

It doesn't stack with one of the other feats that give extra actions as well, too. Alright.

[Speaker 16]
Mediah!

[Speaker 5]
We're going to do this really, really fun thing called the escape. Am I grabbed or anything, or did it just bite me?

[Speaker 1]
It just, uh, landed at you.

[Speaker 5]
That's great to know. Um... I'm just gonna...

Hold on. Let me measure the distance this is. Yeah, I can make it.

See you later. I am not dealing with this thing. Good luck, Fook.

I am going to... I'll be right behind you. Good luck!

And after that action to get out... Is there anything we can do right now? I have used all my heal spells.

That is impressive. Oh, I still have one. Ah, you know what?

I'll save it.

[Speaker 18]
We gotta go. I gotta get ready for work. Go to Hull Chest and get ready for work.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, yeah, nevermind. I'll just roll healing for myself then. Not the Chupacabra.

Not the Chupacabra. Okay, that's my turn. That's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Picastro, beginning of your turn, the boulder rolls over, hits against the portcullis, it is rent open.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I... I walk out. I stand in the doorway.

Can I see the fucking Chupacabra from there? I shoot it. Hits.

Ah, and then I reload. End of turn.

[Speaker 4]
Ooch. I'm going to pull out my blue dart and I'm going to try and shoot it with my lethargy poison. Go into DC 18 Fort.

[Speaker 1]
Success.

[Speaker 13]
Aww.

[Speaker 4]
And I don't think I really have much else I can do. And I can't run out that way because of the spike pit, right? It is true.

Hmm. I'm going to run down there. That's my turn.

Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Got a one action to follow you. Now he's going to make a bunch of will saves. Heart, go ahead and ping that thing for me once you get a chance.

Yes.

[Speaker 15]
Oh, it's heightened.

[Speaker 1]
First thing. There we go. We bite.

We hit. We grab. We fail to grab.

Grabbing counts as another hostile action so I roll my save again. That one succeeds.

[Speaker 5]
It's a basic will, so you take half.

[Speaker 1]
I take half. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Does grapple count as hostile? So you need a third?

[Speaker 1]
He already made that second one. That's what the half is for. He misses his call attack.

He has to roll a save again. It succeeds. But it will not help him.

That half damage will still kill him.

[Speaker 5]
We love Needle of Vengeance.

[Speaker 3]
Hello. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 10]
I'm so fucking tired, man.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, shit. There you go. All right.

Beautiful. Everybody, good job. Castro about to level up.

Minaya also about to level up. Is that all for tonight?

[Speaker 1]
That's all for tonight. You guys have cleared the way to the tunnels there. You'll be able to start off.

You'll be able to explore anything in this local area. But for now, you'll be able to reseal or keep a portcullis in front of the tunnels so that no new rats come up.

[Speaker 6]
As long as somebody doesn't interfere with it.

[Speaker 10]
I do all the interfering. I'm kidding.

[Speaker 6]
All right, guys. Thanks a lot. I gotta get ready for work.

[Speaker 4]
You sound tired.

[Speaker 13]
Thank you for running.

[Speaker 4]
Was there any loot except for that chest?

[Speaker 2]
There was that chest. That chest is mine.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair. I get ring, two alchemist fires, and a bioluminescence.

[Speaker 2]
I don't need the bioluminescence. But I do need that.

[Speaker 6]
I must do that fire. Can I have the ring? Sure, man.

I like rings. I'll feast on the cooked rats. That shall be my prize.

[Speaker 13]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Are you able to split up in the party? The... Oh, Mania.

We have an anglerfish lantern. Figured you might want that.

[Speaker 6]
Are we not gonna sell it?

[Speaker 2]
Or we could sell it. Because it is 150 gold. We can split that up as well.

[Speaker 1]
We can sell it.

[Speaker 5]
I can see in the dark.

[Speaker 1]
After all the rat statues and stuff like that.

[Speaker 6]
I think you should be at 24 now. And then there's the gold that you guys haven't split up yet.

[Speaker 2]
I think you're able to do that. Get rid of the lantern and add 150 to the gold pile. And then I think as a DM you can split up the wealth.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna move that. Move items. Go here.

Convert all treasure items into coin. Oh, so that doesn't change that. Do I have the Tor of Spellgun?

If no one else has it. Can I grab it? Yeah, go for it.

[Speaker 10]
It had gun in it.

[Speaker 3]
It's a one time use.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's why I was asking for it. It's one thing. It's a cool trick.

[Speaker 3]
Unless it's a gun that shoots spells more than once then I would have taken it. Or asked for it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, not the bear. It should be the hooch. The hooch, Minaya, Ficastro, and Arsonist Gatling.

Hell yeah. Coins, you now have your coins. Excellent work everybody.

I'm gonna get ready for work now. See you later.

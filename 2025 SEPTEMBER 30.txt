[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Hello. Hell yeah, the GM's here, I can stop talking about Warhammer.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, unless he hasn't spent 90 minutes making a damn map. Which is probably not to make a map.

[Speaker 2]
My apologies also to the two other people on the call who were just trapped in this Warhammer discussion that I did not mean to have happen.

[Speaker 3]
I am not going to lie, I tuned both of you out.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yeah, that's valid.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I have been, oh god, I just jumped off my raft. Oh god, please let me up!

We're good, we're good.

[Speaker 2]
God damn, we were so cringed she threw herself in the ocean.

[Speaker 7]
How does this keep happening?

[Speaker 8]
It's because I'm clumsy, man. Just too damn clumsy.

[Speaker 7]
You ain't got your sea legs! Why am I so tired?

[Speaker 5]
Hey Fraggata, are you more familiar with Pathfinder than I am? Maybe? Is there a way to reduce the check penalty on a piece of armor?

Oh, I have no idea.

[Speaker 3]
I'm pretty new, so I know basic things.

[Speaker 7]
But, yeah, I don't know. Okay. That's fine, thank you.

Reddit can probably help you. Makes sense. Do we have any idea where Minaya's player is?

Heart? Minaya's player? Yeah, Heart.

Heart! That's her name. Her name.

Yeah. Bro, I'm gonna kill this fucking shark. One day, when I get a spear.

Or cause when they see a great white minding it's own business.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, he keeps attacking me. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
There they are. Now I need to go fishing. Oh hell yeah, we're gonna bake a potato.

Fuck it. So how's everybody's Tuesday going? Pretty good.

It's been worse. It's good to hear, good to hear. Oh boy.

What is it? It's...

[Speaker 8]
Dude, you should play an awakened possum and have that as your character art. We do have an awakened skunk.

[Speaker 7]
What's very funny is that I actually had an idea for an awakened animal witch who was a bird.

[Speaker 8]
I think our awakened skunk is a witch? I don't know. I can't confirm that, actually.

[Speaker 7]
Wait, they're what?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know if the skunk is a witch or not. I just know that they're a skunk.

[Speaker 4]
No, if I'm gonna play an awakened animal, it's gonna be this glorious animal.

[Speaker 7]
Put it in voiceover flow. Share with the class. Okay.

Gonna be called this glorious animal. My go-to was gonna be a grizzly bear. They were just going to be a grizzly bear.

[Speaker 2]
They were gonna be an animal barbarian and their animal was gonna be bear.

[Speaker 8]
Should've done that for Kiwi. But not a bear.

[Speaker 2]
Just like a regular tiger.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
My thought process was bears can get on their hind legs, so I can theoretically do things that an unawakened animal would want to do.

[Speaker 7]
I can also just spend most of my time on all fours and just be a bear. I can build more. I think it'd be really funny for a pigeon to cast fireball.

Fireball, fireball, fireball.

[Speaker 6]
Chloe, do I have great news for you?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
That pigeon's got fuckin' bombs ready. Welcome to the drones of the Middle Ages.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Actually, there was a queen who tied incendiaries to a bunch of pigeons.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, Queen Olga.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She burnt a whole city down. I mean, it was pretty justified.

[Speaker 4]
Or, better yet, you get someone to inscribe the fireball rune into a bunch of pigeons on a book.

[Speaker 7]
And you drop that in the middle of a city. That seems excessively complicated. Yeah, but it's also a nuke.

Very interesting, wasn't it? Destroy a whole city? Yeah, I wouldn't do that in this campaign, obviously, because we're trying to save people, but why not?

Ooh, a bumblebee.

[Speaker 8]
An awakened bumblebee.

[Speaker 7]
An awakened bumblebee.

[Speaker 8]
Hi, Jerry. They'd be a druid. Yeah.

Their whole thing would be saving, like, flowers and stuff for their colony.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Alternatively, bumblebee yaoguai.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 2]
Formerly just a queen bee, now she's a queen who was a bee.

[Speaker 3]
They tried to kill her, so she's like, you know what? Screw you guys. I'm leaving.

[Speaker 2]
She's the only survivor of her colony getting wiped out by the winter.

[Speaker 3]
The way that bees kill the queens when they get too old to be queen anymore is brutal. They burn her to death with their body heat.

[Speaker 2]
Bees have got to find other ways to kill people, because they do that a lot.

[Speaker 3]
They're horrible. I do love bees, though.

[Speaker 6]
The only other way to kill people would kill them, though, so it's either heat.

[Speaker 3]
Or maybe they have one executioner bee that takes over the team, you know?

[Speaker 2]
That's actually a misconception about bees. The reason why bees die when they sting people is because their stingers aren't designed for human flesh. They're designed for, like, other bugs who have comparatively much thinner carapaces-slash-skin, in quotes.

So their stingers get caught on our skin. But also, fun fact, if you gently remove a bee from your skin, you can actually save it. But if you just let it try to rip itself off, it will rip off the bottom half of its abdomen, and that's what kills it.

Herp thorax.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I fell off again. Oh god. That's awesome, actually.

I did not know you could save a bee when it's stinging you. That's totally something I'd do. Although, I've only ever been stung, like, once, and I was inside a building when it happened.

[Speaker 2]
Only ever been stung by wasps.

[Speaker 3]
Oof, mine was a yellow jacket. Instinctively, I knew it went up my pants leg. I did not feel it, but I went, oh my god, it disappeared, it's obviously in my pants.

And I was not incorrect, unfortunately.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, my experiences were a big-ass hornet on my shin. And one time when I was walking through the woods and I had, like, three or four wasps that looked like yellow jackets stung me on the ankle. But, like, if those were yellow jackets, then their stings do not hurt as much as advertised.

[Speaker 8]
Could it have been a yellow fly?

[Speaker 2]
They were pretty distinctly wasp-shaped.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, okay. Ruleable anchor, we're gonna make an anchor, and we're gonna...

[Speaker 4]
Actually, I wouldn't be able to play an awakened animal because they're rare.

[Speaker 2]
Dammit. You just gotta run... You just gotta run a game, you gotta get your rare tokens.

[Speaker 4]
Nah, I'm dyslexic as shit, man, I can't run a game.

[Speaker 2]
Listen, all I know is that James is gonna come to love me. A lot of my favorite things in this game are rare options, so I'm gonna run a lot of games when I have the time to.

[Speaker 7]
If he allows you to. This is a big island, I have to stop here.

[Speaker 2]
Like, my favorite class and two of my favorite ancestries are all rare.

[Speaker 4]
Hopefully, eventually, he'll let us all have access to it.

[Speaker 7]
Eh, maybe. I'm new here, so I don't really make demands. Yeah.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm hoping someday it'll work, like, you can, you know, run a session, get that token, unlock a rare option, and then you just have that option forever.

[Speaker 7]
Well, that's the way it works. The way it was explained to me was that it was by character. I think it is by character.

Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so if I unlock it, if I get a token, I can make an exemplar, but I would need to run another session to make another exemplar. Cool.

[Speaker 7]
Cool. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Oh my god, I found the biggest fucking island. Oh, the shark bit my ass. Alright.

Let's see, can I make a stone axe? Oh, I need planks. No!

Oh, that sucks.

[Speaker 7]
Hopefully, it starts. I want to be in bed before three.

[Speaker 2]
I just like how I saw the, I looked at the clock, saw it said like 1033, I was like, oh fuck, I'm late, and evidently I wasn't.

[Speaker 7]
Oh boy, what the fuck was that? Let's go back to the ship. Oh, I'm gonna die.

I'm so dead. This is the end.

[Speaker 5]
Any particular reason why?

[Speaker 3]
Because I'm very low on health and I have to swim back to my raft, which is gonna cause a bite in the ass from the shark. Unless I just stand here and wait for it to attack my...

[Speaker 8]
Oh no, he wants me, he doesn't care about the raft. Maybe he does. Alright, I'm gonna take advantage of that and swim.

Please do not bite my butt. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, he's looking at me, he's looking at me! Oh, I made it.

[Speaker 7]
I made it! You know what? I'm gonna save and start on a better thing.

[Speaker 4]
There's a penguin in Japan that fell in love with an anime poster and it died on its feet. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
I was giving it pebbles and it was just placing them. I love that penguins give each other pebbles. Actually, they're one of the animals that know prostitution because of the whole pebble thing.

[Speaker 2]
If I remember correctly, I think either chimpanzees or bonobos also have that going on.

[Speaker 3]
Bonobos are just, they solve all of their issues just through lovemaking.

[Speaker 2]
They solve all their issues either through sex or through mob violence.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's through sex. They really don't have much violence. They kick all the violent bonobos out to get them out of the gene pool.

[Speaker 2]
That's fair.

[Speaker 3]
They just love each other.

[Speaker 2]
I thought I saw something like if a male bonobo starts acting foolish, a group of females will kick his ass to keep him in line or something like that.

[Speaker 3]
They'll kick him out of the group.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Meanwhile, on the other end of the jungle, you've got chimpanzees, which are just psychotic little freaks who are having full-on wars. They're one of the only animals that know how to do genocide.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if you're ever looking for a nice rabbit hole to fall down, the Chimp War, very interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that shit was crazy when I read about it. I was like, what do you mean these fuckers have full-on wars?

[Speaker 7]
Absolutely brutal. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Meanwhile, I'm looking over at them like, damn, they some freaks. Me, as a human, not thinking about the collective history of my own species.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. I think parthogenic hatchling is underrated from a roleplay standpoint. Just like, yeah, I'm an exact clone of my mother.

What about it? Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Do we have all the same people from last night?

[Speaker 11]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 7]
That we do. Okay. I need to pick my stuff.

It's gotta be water, feet, dragon stance. I guess I'll just put you for now. Right now I should be a blogger.

Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
The music's a bit more whimsical and mysterious than last time. Oh boy. I think we're approaching our destination, finally.

[Speaker 3]
You can always tell when my upstairs neighbor's dog is about to pee because I just hear the neighbor running in full sprint. They have a puppy.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, what the fuck?

[Speaker 8]
That's metal. Oh, my bird's not happy about something.

[Speaker 1]
It almost sounds like a laugh in the background.

[Speaker 11]
Hmm?

[Speaker 1]
So I heard what almost sounded like a laugh in the background.

[Speaker 8]
I'm gonna go check on him.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 11]
I'm back.

[Speaker 8]
The bird is fine. All is well.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. I'm just waiting on it to load and export.

[Speaker 10]
Please.

[Speaker 1]
Wish my import had worked earlier, but not much to be done about that.

[Speaker 7]
Better late than never, I suppose. I hate being late, though. You gotta make sure all your stuff is dragged over to the party sheet.

Okie dokie. Gymnast Valley. Party sheet.

I just gotta get Ol' Kiwi there. I don't know what I'm gonna have my characters do when I have to leave. Don't you have, like, another, uh...

[Speaker 8]
Couple months, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Nearly a... Well, it's, uh, what? You're thinking, like, January or February or something?

[Speaker 7]
January, hopefully. Yeah, that's plenty of time. Indeed.

Coming occasionally on your phone, or on... Or, I don't know, did they let you...

[Speaker 3]
Did they let you out at any point, or...? Um, on weekends. However, you have to have transportation, and I will be near absolutely no allies. I'll be isolated in the mountains.

[Speaker 4]
What's going on? I told you to come to the one down here. I don't wanna go to the one in fucking Iowa.

Way to fucking outward state I live in, you fucker.

[Speaker 2]
Whoa, dancing, dancing.

[Speaker 8]
That's illegal.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I know, I know vaguely what state they're in. Now all I have to do is check all ten houses in Iowa, and I'll find them.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, no, you just have to search for the oldest house in Iowa, and you'll be good.

[Speaker 7]
Man. I'm in the general facility of that. No, you're not.

You don't know that. I do know that, because I just Googled it.

[Speaker 4]
Where is it? Don't say it, you bitch.

[Speaker 7]
The oldest house in Iowa is actually... I don't even know how to say that.

[Speaker 11]
...in Indiana.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Not in the US. Crazy.

Iowa. Not in the US? No, we're not.

Are we gonna get started soon? Yeah. I can't stay up eternally.

Everybody in... ...the party. They are excellent.

You don't know. Maybe I walk every day, Astel.

[Speaker 8]
Literally look at a map. Have your house pinged.

[Speaker 7]
That is hilarious. But that's enough about that. We're already an hour behind schedule, but...

Oh, I need to activate it. Ah! That's not what I fucking look like anymore.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. Wait, what is your... Oh, okay, okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's not my fucking talk.

[Speaker 7]
What the hell?

[Speaker 1]
Don't just drag a bunch of tokens out. You gotta edit your...

[Speaker 7]
...prototype token. Use the same image. I thought I had.

Who? Me. I did it for them.

[Speaker 5]
Because they couldn't get it loaded right.

[Speaker 7]
Under appearance, it's still player slash orc. So you just have to go... ...double click on your character sheet...

...in the actors tab... ...bring up the prototype token... ...navigate to appearance...

...and then just fix it there. Make it drag yourself back on the... Oh, boy.

The only problem is... ...I don't know what the file for my character is listed as.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what...

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck was that? Anyways. I think I just make it over to Blood Apple Hollow.

Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, gang. Are we going left or right?

[Speaker 4]
Castro votes... ...he doesn't give a shit. I vote left.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, let's go then.

[Speaker 3]
Um, what does the place look like?

[Speaker 1]
There are apples literally everywhere. And, like, the water is kind of like... ...red and sticky and...

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god. Is this the one that Kibi ate an apple and turned 23 instead of 33?

[Speaker 4]
You're in a spoiler list, Rogatha.

[Speaker 3]
This is?

[Speaker 1]
It's not a spoiler. Your character lived through it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, my character was here. Oh my god, I can't wait to eat another apple. Oh, that was when...

Oh, no. I can't eat another apple. Well, I can because it's not guaranteed.

But, Kibi does remember that the apples give off random effects if you eat them. So, if I... If I eat one and go back in age...

...I will be playing a 13-year-old Kibi. Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. These two didn't get connected. Which...

I shouldn't expect.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. I think I have the... Nice.

Now I look normal.

[Speaker 11]
And I don't...

[Speaker 1]
I can't delete the orcs. Yeah, I told you that. If you keep dragging them out there, it's not...

[Speaker 11]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 2]
Plus ones are a bigger deal here than other games, really, I promise. Thank you for the wisdom, god.

[Speaker 9]
The game is paused.

[Speaker 6]
What does this give me to speak of?

[Speaker 3]
Really, I opened Kibi's inventory expecting her to have some kind of game in there. But, no.

[Speaker 5]
Kairona is gonna pick up a couple of apples and take a sample of the water.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. I'm definitely gonna eat an apple. First chance I get.

[Speaker 9]
Are you certain that... Are you certain that the apples in this mysterious, magical forest are safe for consumption?

[Speaker 3]
Not at all. That's the fun of it.

[Speaker 1]
You lot have a very...

[Speaker 9]
You lot have a very interesting definition of fun.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody add yourselves to the initiative.

[Speaker 9]
I suspect that we're being ambushed. That is not initiative.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, no. Have an action ready, minstrel. Hello there, and welcome back to the tank moving last in the initiative.

What did I do for Kibi? Need to roll this twice. Heart has temporarily vanished.

What? Me? I'm here.

Heart. Oh, heart. This happens, like, every session.

It does, it does. If you hear something disconnect, it's heart. Hopefully they don't have to relocate at that coffee shop like that one time.

There they are. Welcome back. Welcome back.

[Speaker 2]
I hope you didn't get weirdly banished from Foundry again for no reason.

[Speaker 6]
Haha. No, it seems that my account isn't possessed this time, so there is that.

[Speaker 7]
Woo! I'm so excited to bite into one of these apples.

[Speaker 3]
It's definitely going to mess me up, though. It's going to nerf Kibi.

[Speaker 7]
You have to go now. Yeah, I'm writing... One sec.

It will be very funny to see what befalls Kibi, though. That's where she lives. Indeed.

Hey, buddy. Maelstrom! Am I still audible or disconnected?

Yes. We can hear you. Hey, cool.

Yeah. Why did it not roll me onto the initiative the first time?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I did it wrong. That's what it was. There we go.

Yay, I rolled even worse! Oh no. Well, you know, better than an initiative roll than a saving throw.

Do we have to reroll? Oh, there we are. I'm at an 18 on the initiative tracker for some reason.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm not looking at that gift horse in the mouth. Manaia, you hear shouting on the other side of the door here.

[Speaker 11]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I'll tell the rest of the team and ask if we are breaking in.

[Speaker 2]
If there are people in trouble, then I... If there are people in trouble, then we should are intervening.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. I'll sort of, like, nudge you best I can with the wings to go first. Unfortunately, this is...

[Speaker 2]
Several people would have to delay their turns for me to be gone first.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, well, I'll open the door then. Off we go. Wait, can I go just past the door?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks to, like, Fog of War, there is a wall there.

[Speaker 6]
Hi. Ah, creatures. How hostile do they look towards us?

[Speaker 1]
Hey, no, please do not speak while it's not on your turn, alright? Alright, heart, what was that?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, how hostile do they look towards us?

[Speaker 1]
Very.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, duh. Alright, so I imagine that was two actions to walk up to the door and open it, and, well, Kyrona is next, so... Kyrona, please enjoy a damage increase.

And I'm just gonna put the healing on myself since I was the door opener. Alright, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
I think I fixed all those. Cool.

[Speaker 11]
Alright. Where's Kyrona?

[Speaker 5]
Are they obviously hostile?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, very obviously hostile.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Alright, so I'm gonna cast Telekinetic Projectile. Does that heightened plus one mean I cast it as an extra action or as an extra level?

[Speaker 1]
That's if you're casting it at an extra rank. I don't know if the Matrix uses that as a... If they have to prepare their stuff at a higher rank or...

[Speaker 5]
Alright, so I'll just do it as is. And I'll go with Bloodshed. And with my other action I'll cast Glass Shield.

[Speaker 1]
Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Belgrim.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. Also, now that I can speak, Cantrips auto-heighten to the highest level you can cast them at, so you would be casting Telekinetic Projectile at rank two. Just a heads up.

[Speaker 5]
Hang on before you keep going, but would that use my second level spell?

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
The Cantrips themselves just auto-level up. Kind of like in 5e, they do the same thing.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like the 5e scaling, except more consistent. I'm going to demoralize... Which one of you seems like you could cause more problems?

You're closer to Minaya. I'm gonna demoralize this one. Gonna pull up the basic action macro.

There it is. There we are. That's a fail.

I can live with that. And then, if I move to here, am I able to melee this guy?

[Speaker 1]
He's right next to you, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I wasn't sure if the log was giving him any sort of cover in that regard. In that case, I'm going to use my last two actions to defensive advance. Sounds good.

That's raise a shield, stride, I'll just put it up here so that can...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I know what it does. You just have to roll to get there. There.

Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Rog, I'm begging you. Roll higher. You know what?

Screw it. I'll hero point that. And, you know, it was worth it.

And here we are.

[Speaker 1]
Very nice. Is that the end of your turn? Uh, that...

yeah, that is the end of my turn. This guy gets a little bit of healing back.

[Speaker 3]
What are they? They're unnamed.

[Speaker 1]
These are redcaps.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, they sure are.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to... Use them by, like, cradling a couple of apples. This is gonna...

Take a bite out of... This. And then this.

[Speaker 9]
Motherfucker's double-fisting fruit.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

[Speaker 5]
Man, imagine the daiquiris you could make here.

[Speaker 3]
Right?

[Speaker 1]
Imagine the apple pies. Ooh, I need to... The second my liver labs are back to normal, I gotta...

Gotta go to the daiquiri barn.

[Speaker 4]
What the hell's a daiquiri?

[Speaker 1]
I don't want to create a spellcasting item, I want to give him the effects of invisibility.

[Speaker 2]
I imagine you could probably just pull them from where they're on the chat onto the character token.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I did that, and that's where it's recommending that I create an item or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
There we are.

[Speaker 1]
He has to do this before he takes the invisibility potion, so he's gonna do... Tend to Moralize. He is...

Good at it. Very good. The three of his actions...

Do is reach over and... Smack at Minaya.

[Speaker 2]
That scythe has... That scythe has fuckin' reach. Oh, no.

Actually, if it's 10 foot, I wouldn't be able to hit Minaya, because she's 15 feet away.

[Speaker 1]
No, she's not. It's just two squares over.

[Speaker 2]
Every other square is 10. Oh, hang on, I was... Sorry, I got distracted by that.

I'm gonna use my Champion's Reaction, actually. Okay. There you are.

Drag Champion's Resistance onto yourself, Minaya, and then I'm gonna hit this guy in the face. Get over here. Go over here.

Hit with this. That's a hit.

[Speaker 9]
And she goes, Oi! Where do you get off cutting up barrettes, you sick fuck?

[Speaker 6]
Minaya doesn't comment on the barrette thing, but is very thankful for it.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to... Red trip on this thing. First trip.

Hey.

[Speaker 9]
Up there. My one weakness. My scythe balance.

[Speaker 1]
You get tried for a little bit of revenge with a stomp on the old iron boot. And that hit. Oh, this motherfucker's wearing stilettos.

He is. He's got iron boots.

[Speaker 2]
You made several mistakes there, friend. And the biggest one was not going invisible like your pal over there. And she just gestures in this general area.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, stomp lets me move at the same time. Well, that's okay. If it hits a prone creature, you get the stilettos.

That is the end of his turn.

[Speaker 4]
Castro. Okay, so I will move over here. I will target this red cap, and I will try to shoot its head off.

Okay, I will reload and end my turn.

[Speaker 11]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah. Alright, Keeb.

[Speaker 10]
This guy right here.

[Speaker 3]
Invisible.

[Speaker 10]
And undetected.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, the guy that I'm attacking right now?

[Speaker 1]
If he's the guy that you're in the same space as.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, I can't see that guy. Hence why I'm in his space.

[Speaker 1]
You bump into him.

[Speaker 3]
I bump into him. I go past him.

[Speaker 1]
Excuse me.

[Speaker 3]
My bad. Keebies, apologies.

[Speaker 2]
Let's fucking go, Keebie. We're all rolling 16 damage on crits.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what that little pop-up is, but whatever.

[Speaker 1]
I also don't know what the critical specialization is. Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, I can sweep? Where do I get sweep from?

[Speaker 2]
That's the crit specialization for axes, but you're only level 3, right?

[Speaker 3]
I'm level 5.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you're level 5. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, then you have that. I don't even know how the crit specialization works. That you can't say.

[Speaker 3]
Is sweep an action that I can take?

[Speaker 2]
No, what it is, is if you crit with an axe, their effect is that if there is a target adjacent to the target of the crit, you can compare the attack roll you made against that target's AC. You can hit this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on. You can just hit this guy that's right next to you. Or that's right next to him.

Now, you're aware that he's in that space because you bumped into him. Okay. Can you...

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we can see him. Ooh, he highlights. Okay, that's cool.

Alright, well, that's all my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on, because you get the damage... Let me just scroll back up. The sweep is a different property.

That just says if you're attacking somebody different that's nearby, then you get a bonus. You know, the multi-attack penalty isn't as harsh. But...

AC is lower than the attack roll. You deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die that you rolled, including the extra dice. But this isn't doubled, so...

Just basically, what you get to do is you get to target this guy and then roll normal damage. Like this, for instance.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh, okay, awesome. You did it for me.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna smack him with it. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you, thank you. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
But no. I'm gonna grab my shotgun.

[Speaker 3]
I will be right back. JD's in Lintelman.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. He's trying to attack these guys' tribe. Against their fae, I think.

I believe. And, uh... Cold iron should affect them.

A miss! We're re-rolling that. Still a miss!

Alright. Then we are doing Stealthy Heart again.

[Speaker 7]
Who goes next? It's Helga and Corona. Helga, can you...

[Speaker 5]
Don't fully understand Spellstrike. And Spellstrike is two actions.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it gets cast as part of Spellstrike automatically. It's essentially action compression.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I didn't know that was a thing, and I missed it anyways.

[Speaker 4]
Am I the only one that hears that, like, fuzzy noise in the background?

[Speaker 2]
I'm assuming it's rain, though I have no idea.

[Speaker 5]
No, I think James has a fan running or something.

[Speaker 10]
It is.

[Speaker 4]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And then Force Fang is one action. It would let you recharge your Spellstrike, if that's still what you wanted to do.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because I just used it. Yeah. So, um...

Force Fang automatically hits?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Works like magic missile.

[Speaker 5]
All right. And it's going to be 2d4... plus 1.

[Speaker 10]
Plus 2. I think that worked.

[Speaker 5]
All right. 12 damage. Thank you for talking me through that.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, very nice.

[Speaker 5]
No problem.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Magus is kind of a complex class, but fortunately I've obsessively pored over it.

[Speaker 10]
That guy's not looking so well. Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 10]
Where'd Haralda go?

[Speaker 2]
With one action, I'm going to stand. And then with my last two actions, I'm going to defensive advance against to step into flanking... and hit this guy in the face with a hammer with my shield raised.

[Speaker 10]
It's...

[Speaker 2]
And that's 11 damage. It's... And I raise my shield, and that's my turn.

And I finally get rid of this fear. Oh, and then you have to roll the bleed damage on me.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, there it is. What you do is you end your turn, and all persistent damage just gets handled automatically.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 2]
That's a good system. Also, ouch! Oh shit, Haralda fucking gave this redcap's skull in, I just noticed.

[Speaker 9]
Good job, me.

[Speaker 1]
I drink a healing potion.

[Speaker 13]
I am back, did I miss anything? Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm back. Killed one of the redcaps. Oh, that's about it.

I drank a healing potion. Do the rest of us hear him crunching into an apple while invisible? Possibly.

[Speaker 12]
Nice.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, it's just really good.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hang on, I... Sorry, my first time playing champion, Retributive Strike.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. Is it like a one-time thing, or is that a thing you can do repeatedly? Repeatedly.

[Speaker 2]
It eats my reaction, but outside of that it's basically unlimited.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, awesome.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And now I'm gonna hit him in the face with a hammer, theoretically. Damn.

Tragically, he's still invisible. Actually, would he drop invisibility when he makes the attack? I just wanted to check.

Yeah, he would drop invisibility when he makes the attack. You can get rid of that. Oh, cool.

Oh, cool, in that case I hit. And that's 15.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. And then I'm gonna target Kibi with that same stomp attack.

[Speaker 3]
Hit me. I can take it.

[Speaker 11]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, god. Kibi regrets her words. Oh, okay.

That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Champion's Reaction only applies once. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. And then it's not letting me, I guess... Do I just roll this twice?

No, that's not gonna work. No. Uh, we'll see.

I guess that's his turn. For Gastro.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I'm gonna target this Red Cap. I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna hit.

I'm gonna reload, and guess what? I'm gonna do it again.

[Speaker 1]
It pings off his boot?

[Speaker 3]
What? He takes no damage? Why?

Oh, damn, I'm out of ammo. Shit. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It was a really low roll.

[Speaker 2]
He downed that Oak and Apple, so he's got resistance to bludgeoning and piercing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no! You have ammo in your bag. You just have to pull it out.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, so instead of reloading, I pull the ammo out of my bag. How do I do that?

[Speaker 3]
Um, alright, so in... Your... Actions tab...

Find your Coat Pistol, and where it says no ammo... Oh, shit, hold on, we gotta actually pull it out of your bag. Hold on, I got you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I see it. Realms, Coat Pistol, 60.

[Speaker 11]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. There you go. Okay, so that took...

Two actions, or do I still have one action?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, so taking it out and loading it would be two actions. Okay, so that's the end of my turn. Alright.

Ki-bi-bi. Ki-bi-bi. Oh, did they hit me previously?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... Alright, let's see...

Retribution.

[Speaker 1]
There you go, it worked. Now, do you stand up before you do this?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, so that would be one action.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
This would be my final... This would be my final action. And that would be my turn.

Actually, that action there will have been... Nevermind, it wouldn't have been. We're good.

Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Welcome to bleeding.

[Speaker 11]
Mediah.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay. Okay. Well, that's not good.

And, um... We're going to heal Ki-bi. Rest.

Just living. Healing. Enjoy the healing, Ki-bi.

Thank you. No problem. Then we have one more action.

Of which we are going to, uh... Needle of Vengeance this thing. Please make a will.

Uh, not yet. So, the Needle of Vengeance will be against Ki-bi, since she's the most injured right now. So, this guy can't attack Ki-bi without having to roll a will save.

Ooh, that's cool. Alright, and that will be the end of my turn. Oops.

Oh, wrong thing. That will be the end of my turn. Oh, right.

I was thinking if I could give Restored Spirit again. There we go. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
That would be four actions. Oh, nevermind, my bad. I got mixed up with the other thing.

[Speaker 5]
So, the thingy says this guy is injured. Uh...

[Speaker 1]
Which he is.

[Speaker 5]
Halfway? Something like that?

[Speaker 1]
Injured? Yeah, I think beat up is like, um... If they're damaged before half.

And then injured is once they go below half. This guy is definitely below half.

[Speaker 5]
I agree. I am gonna Spellstrike cast... Thanks, Bolt.

No, I don't want to roll a thing. I want to roll attack. Ah, tits.

[Speaker 10]
Why do you keep rolling sevens?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
But that's the third seven that you rolled.

[Speaker 2]
Might say that. Three sevens? That's lucky.

Except it doesn't high enough to hit. You should just...

[Speaker 5]
Hang on one second. Spellstrike turns that into one action. Can I try and attack him again?

Without it being Spellstrike?

[Speaker 1]
If you have a... Um, yeah. If you don't have like a...

If you want to do a normal attack. You have a...

[Speaker 2]
What's the color? Yeah. Just shoot him with your bow.

[Speaker 5]
There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Sometimes things like that will happen. Hold on, hold on! Oh, you rolled a spell attack roll.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because I'm just casting Phase Bolt as a spell and not as a Spellstrike.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh... I'll be right back. Did you cast it before on this turn?

Because Phase Bolt's two actions.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, but doing it as Spellstrike makes it one action, you said.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no, it reduces... What it is, is it is a... It is a strike and a casting of a spell for two actions instead of what would usually be three.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So Spellstrike is always two actions regardless of how many... How many actions like an attack or a spell would be.

[Speaker 12]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. But what you could use that for is you could use that for a regular attack, for instance, which is with the bow.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Okay, um, do you want me to re-roll my attack with the bow?

[Speaker 1]
No, no. That'd be murder.

[Speaker 5]
Just roll the damage for the bow?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just do the bow's damage.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. Uh, and... I think TV and Krelka get splashed there.

[Speaker 13]
Thank you for talking me through that.

[Speaker 2]
Not a problem. Uh, I am going to, uh, lay on hands myself, because ouch.

[Speaker 5]
In public?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, in front of everybody, including the red cap.

[Speaker 1]
Um... This guy. Uh, you can see, as expected, the little shards that are embedding themselves and continuing to move inside this guy's skin are hurting him more.

[Speaker 2]
And then I'm going to once again defensive advance, because this feat is awesome. Which means I raise my shield, I stride, and I strike. Best thing they added to Champion.

You know, sometimes good luck has to have an end. And that's my turn. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
There should be a little end turn button on your thing as well for your encounter tracker, or... Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Oh, is it? Oh, it's on the tab.

I had the thing popped out, that's why.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, thanks for the heads up. Inventory... Do I have anything else that helps me here?

Not really.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go... Melee... I will shield block.

Oh, my bad.

[Speaker 3]
Dude, I gotta play a champion.

[Speaker 11]
There you go.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, this class is awesome.

[Speaker 1]
And start kicking that gear. Let's work.

[Speaker 2]
Just swats his foot away with her shield. And ooh, another miss.

[Speaker 1]
That is...

[Speaker 6]
I forgot to say, he's attacking Kibi, right? He's supposed to be making will saves. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Only the last one. Only the last one was on Kibi. We know.

Okay, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
So I'm gonna move... Hold on. Oh, you succeeded.

There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, well, good for him. He doesn't need to do nothing bad happens to the nerd. Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Can I go? Mm-hmm. Okay.

So I move... I shoot... Oh, I need to register.

One second. I shoot... You got this.

26... Hey! Damage to...

[Speaker 1]
Did you get a roll book to me?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so then I... I use a reloading strike and I... And I hit the living shit out of it.

Ah, damn. That's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You know that just watches the gunslinger walk up, fire a shot point-blank into this dude's head, and the bullet bounce off?

[Speaker 3]
I just realized I never raged, so... So that's been nerfing me a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
You've been hiding your power level like an anime character.

[Speaker 3]
I am re-rolling that. Hold on. Let's fucking go, Kibi!

How's he looking after that?

[Speaker 1]
Probably dead.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hell yeah, he gets decapitated. Taking his hat, too. And his boots.

[Speaker 1]
Taking his shoes.

[Speaker 3]
Taking his hat and his boots. Ooh, blood hammer reserve. What is that?

Oh, I don't need that. Kibi doesn't need that.

[Speaker 6]
I hope you don't...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. I think the gunslinger might get use out of the invisibility potion. Either him or the mogus.

[Speaker 4]
I'll take the invisibility potion if no one else takes it by the end of the session. Alright, sounds good. Don't worry, I'm currently looking at other gun options I can buy after the session.

[Speaker 1]
Nice.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to treat lonesomes.

[Speaker 12]
Where's a loot item to interact with?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, if you double click on these guys, then you can actually grab from their inventory directly. It means collecting odd ends and odd shields and swords and stuff like that from these guys. It's a lot easier.

[Speaker 4]
Can I take the invisibility potion? Go right ahead, I won't stop you.

[Speaker 5]
Can I have a share of the loot before everyone takes it? It's in the party stash.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's in the party stash.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Why is treat wounds not available to me? I don't have resistance.

[Speaker 4]
Does anybody want the invisibility? Fuck, you know what I mean.

[Speaker 1]
I can see it's on the very far right.

[Speaker 5]
Would you be willing to let me take it so I can reconstruct the recipe? For what? To make more.

[Speaker 3]
Of what? The invisibility potion.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I figured it out. Here we go.

[Speaker 3]
I have the treat wounds. I just can't treat my fucking wounds. Like I click on it and it says.

[Speaker 1]
It's because the combat tracker was still going.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you can take it out of the party stash. I put it back in for you.

[Speaker 2]
Vrelka's going to look around. She saw these red caps bite into these apples and get superpowers.

[Speaker 5]
Trying to take it. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to dump my other Leon hands into Keebee.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. I'm also going to eat one of the. One of the apples.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and look for the right one.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. What do I do?

[Speaker 1]
She's like a nature check or something like that.

[Speaker 3]
Okey dokey. Dude, I'm so excited. Sixteen.

[Speaker 1]
Sixteen. You find one. Ripe one.

[Speaker 11]
I think ripe.

[Speaker 1]
What do you know that is ripe? I have so many more to work with now.

[Speaker 6]
I'm so excited.

[Speaker 4]
Deck of many cards from an apple this time. I can almost imagine one of the guaranteed things is explosion.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee bits everywhere. Yeah, just explode. Keebee turns into an actual cat.

[Speaker 2]
If you don't explode or turn into an actual cat, is there any chance I can get some medicine? Oh yeah, I can do some healing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh heck yeah. We'll see what happens and then.

[Speaker 1]
Deck of many. Did that apply? It did, it did.

Oh god.

[Speaker 3]
What are we doing? What happened? Ooh.

Kind of sad I didn't get like, I don't know, transformed or something. There's plenty more apples to eat throughout the game, so.

[Speaker 2]
I probably could just see as Keebee starts sparking with electricity and takes a step back.

[Speaker 4]
How big are these apples? Apple sized.

[Speaker 1]
They're apples. No, no, they're like big. They're like pumpkin sized.

Ooh. Like pumpkin, small pumpkins.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, like the little ones? How much do they weigh? Can I pick up one and like, guess its weight?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, what are you driving at?

[Speaker 4]
I want to see if I can put them in my bag.

[Speaker 1]
Sell them to poor people. You just asked that first. Yeah, they've got a lot of bulk because they're fruit.

They could definitely be part of a bunch out here.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe on the way out.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, that's it, I'm curious about the apples. Can I roll survival to try and find a ripe one? Sure.

Hell yeah. Rolled an 18.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. You turn invisible. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Heralda just vanishes. Gosh, I was hoping that'd be a healing one.

[Speaker 3]
Also, I don't see the effect on Kibi and I don't know how to add it.

[Speaker 2]
Same.

[Speaker 1]
Checking now. I was hoping that would pop up in the chat.

[Speaker 10]
Ooh. An attack or something like that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so I'm not seeing the effect. Yeah, it's because the potions themselves often don't have effects unless they... And when I say effects, ones that are like built into the system, or the rest of the system.

That you can just drag on. Okay? But the damage is in the description of it.

[Speaker 3]
Are we gonna run into electricity?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's electric retaliation, so it's just anybody who's fucking with you gets hit with electricity.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I still... Where do I find this? Where do I look for this?

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna drop another one into your inventory.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay, in my inventory.

[Speaker 1]
That way you can read it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'm gonna add one and then use it? Why doesn't it do that?

That's crazy.

[Speaker 1]
So the potions themselves don't have their effects built in yet, it seems.

[Speaker 3]
That's crazy. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna be real, I love this forest so far.

[Speaker 3]
Dude, Kibi got aged down. She was 33, now she's like 23. Can you imagine?

Can you imagine being 33 and then just aging backwards?

[Speaker 1]
I'd love to do that now.

[Speaker 3]
Right?

[Speaker 9]
Alright, door time!

[Speaker 2]
Alright, hang on. Is there any chance I could get some time to refocus and maybe get my wounds treated first?

[Speaker 6]
I can do more healing, how much are you down? And while you're refocusing, Kibi can fix someone as well.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Kibi loses the electrical.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I see. Alright, then we're just going. Off we go, so you don't lose the electrical.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'm sure that me being at 2 thirds of my health won't be a problem.

[Speaker 6]
I can spell heal you, if that helps.

[Speaker 3]
I could eat another apple, I'm fine.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, alright. So we're taking time to fix people. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
I will find another apple.

[Speaker 11]
Probably will take time to refocus.

[Speaker 3]
Probably don't find another apple.

[Speaker 1]
There's apples all over the place. What do you find a rainbow?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna find a gross one. Is that what I'm taking?

[Speaker 1]
That's a gross one. What do we got?

[Speaker 5]
That was a lot of dice.

[Speaker 9]
That was a lot of dice.

[Speaker 2]
If I'm waiting like 20 in-game minutes, I can refocus twice and then just dump two Leon hands into myself.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm gonna find some Covenant Tea, Kibi.

[Speaker 11]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you guys are resting for the 10 minutes?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. And then what do we have for the grid of my crew?

[Speaker 2]
We're resting for the 10, then I'll just immediately Leon hands myself again.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Is anyone low?

[Speaker 3]
Low on what? Health? I think we're pretty fine.

I think we're okay.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I was just saying, if y'all wanted to wait a bit. Theoretically, if we rest for long enough, Leon hands lasts enough to get everybody back to full. But if y'all just want to get going and move forward with the health we have.

Alright, that's fair. Before we head in, Hirogo will just look for one last apple. Just on the off chance we find something helpful.

Okay, nevermind, the game's paused.

[Speaker 3]
Yep, we waited too long. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's a lot of bugs.

[Speaker 13]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
One thousand sturges be upon thee. Everybody out themselves to the ignition.

[Speaker 2]
Oh dear god.

[Speaker 5]
I see you were being literal about the one thousand.

[Speaker 3]
Oh Christ.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled like a real number this time.

[Speaker 11]
There.

[Speaker 1]
There. I wonder where it was. Ah, perfect.

Everybody out to the ignition. Yep.

[Speaker 10]
Wait. Five thirty. Up, over, and down.

[Speaker 1]
Is. There we go. So we had to use two axes to move, so he's nearly attached.

Can't do the same. Partially in your space. Oh, and this is.

What? A red cacti. Run out.

Cacti run out.

[Speaker 10]
With.

[Speaker 5]
Um, can I use a reaction?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 11]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, damn.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't roll.

[Speaker 5]
I figured.

[Speaker 1]
I would have rather used that on the. You should have used that on the next one. Because I wanted to save that crit for Picastro.

[Speaker 4]
Oh no, I'm gonna die.

[Speaker 10]
We're not gonna die.

[Speaker 1]
That's like two. Oh, I wasn't supposed to roll. I had to move.

[Speaker 10]
With that, it's.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we gotta move over. That's more flak again. That's his turn.

Two more bloodseekers. These are going to. Oh, we get here.

Turn. Move a second time. Try to attach.

Missed.

[Speaker 10]
More bugs.

[Speaker 1]
And yeah, alright. That's about how that was going to go. Minaya.

[Speaker 6]
Hello. Um. We are going to cast a spell.

Unfortunately, it would have worked on more of them if they didn't all decide to pile up. But it's fine. Let's see.

How many of these nerds can I hit with it? Most of them. Good, good.

Uh, please. I'll roll the damage. Are you hitting Kyrona or?

Oh, no. Kyrona should be out of it. Is she out of it?

[Speaker 11]
No.

[Speaker 6]
She shouldn't be in it now. I have moved it so she's not being hit by it. But, uh, let me just target all the bugs.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, but I'm ahead of you.

[Speaker 11]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
This is the, now, this is what the fucking Pathfinder Psycho Edition, uh, thing is good for. Target all these people and let me roll for all these people. I don't even know why I'm rolling these for the Bloodseekers.

I don't think they can survive. Except for that one that got a critical. That, that one will, uh, survive, probably.

[Speaker 2]
Bloodseeker 1 living up to his name.

[Speaker 1]
The massive damage immediately.

[Speaker 11]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Takes 28 damage. The massive damage immediately kills him.

[Speaker 3]
How's their, uh, morale?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the Bloodseekers is gonna be pretty poor in a second. Probably these guys too.

[Speaker 6]
It's a shame those four... It's a, it's a shame those four managed to escape, but hey, we got most of the bugs. I do believe I have one action left.

I do! Huzzah.

[Speaker 10]
Oh, he's, he's not big enough.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, how, where goes next? So, Stoke the Hodge. Yet again, folks.

Um.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And then, who needs their health? Ficastro, because currently they're being eaten. Here you go.

And then you get the health bonus. That is the end of my turn. Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I get how that works now. Yep, Hrelga time. Uh, you know.

More of this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna once again defensive advance. So I'm gonna...

Raise my shield. And then a one. Two.

Three. Four. And then I'm gonna strike this redcap who's decided to attack her archer like a dick.

[Speaker 10]
Hey!

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Get it! Do it, lady! A cool, a cool and casual 26 damage as she just brings her hammer directly into this guy's ribs.

[Speaker 5]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Then he's near death. I'm trying to think if I want to push my luck and try to go for a second hit at a minus five. Uh.

It looks like most of the Sturges in that room are dead. Uh, screw it, I'll go for it. Misses.

Oh well, worth a shot. That's my turn.

[Speaker 4]
I have a chance to do something really cool here. Let's hope it works. Okay.

So. Yes. I shoot this bug.

[Speaker 1]
It hits.

[Speaker 4]
Dammit. Well, anyway. I Reloading Strike on this bug.

And fuck! I try to hit it again with Reloading Strike. So that's, uh, this one, I think.

Fuck! Okay, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
That was sure two now, once in a row. You have several ones, man.

[Speaker 11]
Right. God.

[Speaker 1]
You're making me feel bad.

[Speaker 3]
You give him a Hero Point just because you feel bad.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody, speaking of which, I think I mentioned this earlier, everybody should have an additional Hero Point. It's been over an hour.

[Speaker 3]
Awesome, I'll add one to your sheet.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, awesome!

[Speaker 6]
Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
I have bugs on me?

[Speaker 6]
You have bugs on you.

[Speaker 9]
Oh my god. Oh my god. Pardon me, Mr. Mosquito, but do you mind getting the fuck off me?

[Speaker 3]
Alright. We're gonna smashy smash one. Shmarshin' it.

Shmooshin' it. I should bite it. I'm gonna bite it.

No, I'm not. I'm not gonna bite it. I'm gonna bite it.

[Speaker 5]
It's all blood. Seems like an easy way to catch something.

[Speaker 3]
You're right, you're right.

[Speaker 5]
Malaria.

[Speaker 3]
Oh god. I don't want that again. Kibi had malaria once, she doesn't want it again.

It doesn't have the Retribution Axe Circumstance Bonus on it, does it? Did it hit me successfully?

[Speaker 1]
No. You have to... You also tag it for...

You can switch it on artificially, I don't think it does it automatically.

[Speaker 3]
It did automatic, so take two off of that first attack.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry, they're dead. They have... These are minus one creatures.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well the next one, just give him the next...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
He can have the other one. Did the first attack kill him?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they have six hit points.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so just the next hit that I...

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna apply the damage to the other guy, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. And my third action will be... What can I do?

I don't think I can do anything. Yeah, I can't do anything. I mean, I guess I could demoralize it, but what's the point?

[Speaker 5]
You can make it feel bad about itself.

[Speaker 3]
Well, he's already demoralized.

[Speaker 2]
You have a minus one to his last attacks. I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, what is the effect on this middle bloodseeker?

[Speaker 1]
He's off guard.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Because he's attached to... He's attached to Picastro's leg.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you know what, my last action, it will be to move. If that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just show me where you want to move, I'll move you over there.

[Speaker 3]
Right here.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so... I just want to make sure I'm doing this right. If I do a spell strike, I do the attack with my bow and the damage of the spell?

[Speaker 2]
What it is, is for two actions, you make an attack... Yeah, you make an attack with your weapon...

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, just a second. You're going to make a ranged strike, because you're using a ranged weapon, and you have the thing that lets you make the ranged weapon attack, right? So, go ahead and just start off with that.

[Speaker 5]
Target, holy fuckers.

[Speaker 1]
That hits.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Also, I think you accidentally untargeted.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. No, I've got the little blinking arrows.

[Speaker 1]
Why did you... For some reason, I untargeted him. Weird.

Okay, and then tag the spell that you're trying to cast on him.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, I'd like to do electric arc on him and his buddy.

[Speaker 10]
Okay. How is the strike?

[Speaker 2]
I'm not going to lie, bow and arrow spell strikes seem really cool to me. They're like magical trick arrows.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to roll a save. It's a success, but you still roll damage. It's a basic save.

[Speaker 5]
Does the other guy roll also? He also succeeded, it figures.

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm not seeing anything in here that the... Bow time.

[Speaker 5]
It says it targets one or two creatures.

[Speaker 2]
With spell strike, if you're casting a spell that can affect multiple targets, you only affect the target of the strike with that spell for the purposes of that specific spell strike. Unless you have expanded spell strike, which lets you use spell strike for AoEs, or an 8th level feat that lets you use all three actions to spell strike more than one target.

[Speaker 5]
Well, obviously I don't have the 8th level one.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, you still roll damage because it's a basic save. And I think that you still roll the regular... I don't know.

Do you still roll the regular damage of the attack itself?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, you still roll weapon damage. It's functional, you're hitting them with a weapon and a spell at the same time. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Also, he's dead.

[Speaker 5]
How do I apply Arcane Casting?

[Speaker 1]
Let me look at your... It's an action. It's one action, you enter a stance.

Yeah. You just do this. There we go.

You can select a damage type. As your melee strikes deal one extra force damage. This is going to be fun once you get the stat.

[Speaker 5]
Shouldn't it be ranged?

[Speaker 1]
No, so I think... Arcane Cast... Man, I gotta ask you to just like...

I'll let you answer that, but we can't keep talking over each other, right?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, that's fair.

[Speaker 2]
Arcane Cascade...

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to check to see if... Attempt to drain Castro. He's the only person that he has a relative chance of actually hitting.

[Speaker 4]
Shit! Man, I'm gonna...

[Speaker 1]
Come on, that's not...

[Speaker 8]
You're getting lucky there.

[Speaker 4]
I could've done something so cool, but I failed.

[Speaker 3]
You'll get there.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, I will.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? Basic action macro.

[Speaker 10]
Move to... Oh, that...

[Speaker 1]
Trip. Yep. And we get stomping.

[Speaker 7]
Stomping?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and also... Stomping! Stomping on Hroga.

For the boot. He's gonna stomp on Hroga with his high heels on. I'm gonna shield block that.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna put red caps for crossdressers.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, have you seen those fabulous hats?

[Speaker 7]
Right?

[Speaker 1]
You immune to bleed or something?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no. Oh, hang on. No, I'm not.

Why is it... What did I... Oh, it's 2d6.

You have it as 2d6-2, so I guess it must have rolled 2 or less. Or, yeah, it must have just rolled exactly 2 then.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Last one. Oh! This is the only where it was gonna be worth it.

[Speaker 11]
Yep, and...

[Speaker 2]
Yep, and that is... Yeah, I'm down.

[Speaker 1]
We'll get you back up. Dude, there it is again. It says it takes no damage.

So what is going on there?

[Speaker 2]
That time it's because I'm already at 0, so it would just give me a death fail. Oh. It's not a separate damage.

Or increase my wounded value. Or my dying value. Nope, that's not the right thing.

[Speaker 1]
Don't increase your dying value. It's part of the same damage. My bad.

Sorry, I was... Just let me apply it.

[Speaker 13]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Then we have another recap. How does Ficastro look?

[Speaker 4]
Are you asking me? He looks like he's at a little above half. Oh.

He's pale. He's at 14 health. He's always pale.

Where did Tyrona go? Did Tyrona... He's pale as shit.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
Tyrona's face through the floor.

[Speaker 5]
Somebody shoved an apple in my mouth. And it was an invisibility one, I guess. Oh no, I know what.

It must have been something the cat did when she stepped on my keyboard. Thank you, now you're standing in front of my monitor and I can't see anything.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. Gotta love cats.

[Speaker 5]
You are so damn lucky that you're cute.

[Speaker 11]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Ficastro is not instantly killed, which is good.

[Speaker 5]
I'm making a very depressing picture of you.

[Speaker 11]
I'm gonna use Deadly Thieve, though. Oh shit.

[Speaker 1]
That one missed, though.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I think I got kicked out of initiative order.

[Speaker 10]
You did?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Mine was 11. I was all the way down.

[Speaker 10]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
That is the end of this turn. Minaya!

[Speaker 6]
Oh, excellent. Okay. Oh, several people are unconscious.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Um. Hmm. So we have enough time for one of these bad boys.

What's this delivery? Please get back up. I...

Alright. Um. Then we have one more...

One more action. Can't do much with that action. We're going to stoke the heart again.

Press... Here you go. And here you go.

End of turn.

[Speaker 11]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's the fuck... It's this guy. Well, I'm here.

I'm here now.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Yes. Wait.

I wouldn't still be unconscious because I got raised by, uh... I got raised by healing.

[Speaker 1]
Just give... Dude, give me some. I'm doing this guy.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I... I know that you're not still unconscious.

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm saying it's my age.

[Speaker 2]
I... No, no. I...

Uh. Oh, he rolled a nat 20. My bad.

Yeah. Just let me do it.

[Speaker 1]
You can get a dream one.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, shit. Now I'm dying again. And...

[Speaker 10]
Heavey.

[Speaker 3]
Heavey. We'll smash... There's two that I need to smash, but you know what?

We'll get this one first because I'm right next to it. Oh my god. Holy shit.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, it's telling me to select a target, but I already selected it, so...

[Speaker 1]
Well, because you got a critical hit, so you could, like, um... You could crit something.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Dude, that was a sexy critical hit, too. Oh my god.

Heavey. Get it, girl.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Maxing damage immediately kills them. Now, who do you want that, uh, 22 damage to apply to?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it can apply to anybody in the vicinity.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you could target Picastro. You could target Karkos.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I did not even see that guy. Yeah, the second attack will go to him.

[Speaker 1]
Hey!

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... He's not happy.

I'm gonna attack this guy. Oh my god, Keeby. Girl.

And the second attack will be this guy. Holy shit, Keeb.

[Speaker 4]
He's doing the whole thing I wanted to do.

[Speaker 1]
You could just farm... Every time I do this where I put lower level enemies in, you could just farm out...

[Speaker 11]
Oh my god. Yeah, that was awesome.

[Speaker 1]
You could just start cleaning.

[Speaker 3]
Clean it out, man.

[Speaker 5]
So, I think I'm just gonna do the same thing as last time? No, I'm not gonna get fancy with it. I'm just gonna shoot him with an arrow.

[Speaker 1]
He says, ah, fuck. Uh, there's no enemies next to him if you don't want to apply the splash damage.

[Speaker 5]
I would prefer not to.

[Speaker 1]
Because there is also an unconscious... That guy there. And you.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Is the red cap hat that I have... Can I put that on a red cap and just own one?

Is that how that works? I don't remember.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you can put it on a toadstool.

[Speaker 3]
A toadstool, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Needs some fresh blood, but besides that... Alright, very good. So that was a...

What was that, you rolled? You hit once. No, but are you still there?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, what? Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you rolled and you hit him. I dealt the damage. Did you want to do anything else?

[Speaker 5]
Um... So... There's only one...

Action.

[Speaker 1]
Um... Remember, you could always demoralize. Um...

If you want to demoralize, you could use phase fortune. Or let's try that again, and that lets you... Reroll it.

[Speaker 5]
Um... Can I cast a cantrip?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, as long as you have actions for it. Where's the... There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I would say you can also move out of range of the two red caps.

[Speaker 3]
Nah, fuck em.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Feed him a hot dog.

[Speaker 10]
Buff of poison. Oh, it's my fortune. Not great.

[Speaker 11]
Ooh!

[Speaker 5]
And I think I have that heightened plus two?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, puff of poison only heightens every other spell rank.

[Speaker 5]
I have level two spells.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it only heightens once you get to level three. Is what that means.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he doesn't have persistent poison. He's looking rough.

[Speaker 10]
Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's right, he gets persistent poison now. Alright, I was wondering where... There's something else here.

Hrelga!

[Speaker 2]
One action, Hrelga's gonna stand up. I'm then going to hit this red cap over the head with a hammer like Mario. It's...

Ten damage. Yep. She caves this bastard's skull in.

And for my last action... I am going to reattach my shield to my arm. Hm.

Very good. Why isn't... Oh, my shield's broken, nevermind, that's why I couldn't use it.

Okay. In that case, with my last action, I will... Hm.

I guess I will just move here to attempt to drag Ficastro away from that red cap on my next turn. Okay. That's my turn.

And... Oh, there's the end turn button. Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Ficastro is... Full unconscious.

[Speaker 4]
Yay.

[Speaker 10]
Hi buddy.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, hold on a second. I will damage you, but then I'm using two actions to get the fuck out of here.

[Speaker 2]
Hang on. I... Da da da da, da da da.

This, I can't reactive strike, but she can still get resistance.

[Speaker 1]
I've got 50 movement speed? Why are they... Why can they move so fast?

What the fuck?

[Speaker 3]
Is there plugs or red caps? I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Red caps are fucking scary is why they can do that.

[Speaker 1]
He starts going all...

[Speaker 9]
Finally, one of these fuckers with common sense.

[Speaker 1]
Kairona gave you...

[Speaker 2]
Hang on. Oh wait, we're still in combat, nevermind.

[Speaker 1]
Redo the... Okay. There we go.

[Speaker 6]
Ficastro, please take that healing.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 6]
You are most welcome. And with my last action... Well, the red cap is just gone gone.

So... Do you have any persistent damage on you?

[Speaker 4]
Me?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, you.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think so. It doesn't say...

[Speaker 6]
I've demoralized, but that's about it. Cool, then all is well. I'll just use my last action to just like...

I guess, shuffle in a circle. All is well then.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, I leveled up!

[Speaker 6]
Oh, congratulations. Nice!

[Speaker 2]
I am less than 100 XP away from leveling up hilariously.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. Lesson learned. Let's open this door.

Come on, you're fine.

[Speaker 2]
I am... Are we not going to try to heal?

[Speaker 6]
Last time that happened, this happened. We're going through the door now.

[Speaker 3]
Who needs healing? I have potions, I can just give people.

[Speaker 2]
I need healing. I need a lot of healing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I think we can take 10 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
In this room, there is an apple cart.

[Speaker 12]
Oh, splendid.

[Speaker 1]
With a bunch of magically preserved apples.

[Speaker 6]
Cool. Minaya saw that only good things happen, and so she made sure that only good things can happen, and so eats one.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like to harvest a couple of red caps, and bloodseeker legs and beaks.

[Speaker 11]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
To start rebuilding my stash of interesting components.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. Thanks, Rogatha. You're welcome.

Can I use it? Click on it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. For reference, one of the Pathfinder 2-isms... I guess at 5th level you get your crit specialization, but people crit more often when they're fighting lower level enemies, or just when they really stack up a bunch of bonuses, because you crit anything that's either 20, or if you roll, 10, over whatever the DC is, right?

So every time fucking PB went after the bloodseeker, that was pretty much a guaranteed crit. Or like a really, really likely crit. Which meant she got to hit the fucking red cap every time.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, looks like someone forgot to loot. This red cap.

[Speaker 3]
You just throw it in the party stash.

[Speaker 4]
Sounds like a good idea.

[Speaker 2]
I will say, if we don't take time to heal up, I'm pretty sure that encounters like that are going to wear us down.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, but we're going to keep getting encounters if we keep taking 10 minutes, and we'll just be stuck in this room forever. Oh, just us being stuck in all the loot. Who took all the loot?

Who did the loot thing?

[Speaker 1]
There's no loot in there. I'm adding it now. It's my bad.

I'm also looking for my macro. I have one. I probably will pocket a couple of the apples if I can.

I'm going to shut this fucking door. I will turn this fucking car around if I cannot. Everybody back away.

I'm working the apples.

[Speaker 2]
What a man, work his apple magic.

[Speaker 10]
Your bug keeps popping out.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to have to log off, guys. It's really late for me.

[Speaker 1]
No, really. I've added a fuckton of potions here. There are no other combat encounters in the immediate vicinity.

There is that guy that's waiting outside with the drake and all that. But if you wanted to, you could activate the Sun Shrine here and not worry about him.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, let's do that.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't fully know what activating the Sun Shrine entails, so I guess I'm down with that if everyone else is.

[Speaker 4]
We all do a dance. Yeah. Something like that?

We dance. No, it prevents, it helps with the snow that hasn't happened yet. From what I understand.

I played like three sessions before I got rebooted, so I don't remember.

[Speaker 1]
Basically, when the frost comes down come wintertime, the Sun Shrines keep the frost away temporarily. They have to be reactivated. Usually means stationing people nearby.

Unless there's no people stationed nearby, or the people at that place switch allegiances. Lots of problems. Yeah, when you're trying to rest, usually I will roll for encounters every 10 to 30 minutes.

Usually every 10 minutes, depending on how quickly people are moving through them. If you're resting, I'm going to roll again. Some of the rolls that I make are normally not an encounter, but if I'm rolling a six-sided die, six is an encounter, five is like an encounter shows up during the next rest.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, only reason I was asking is just because...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you constantly try to, if you only try to, well, after every fight we're going to take 10 minutes. It's like, okay. You're just doubling the, basically doubling the chance of dealing with additional encounters there.

[Speaker 4]
I have a question, James. True. Is the guy that runs the realm or the kingdom, the one that is actively wanting the Sun Shrines activated?

Is there a central entity that wants it activated?

[Speaker 1]
There is a central entity. Nobody knows him, but there are a lot of other people who also want it activated. Like Oberon is Kyrona's patron, and he wants it activated.

[Speaker 4]
So what I'm hearing is I should start a mercenary guild and charge the living fuck out of people to stave ship people out of these places. Yeah, you can get away with that. Fuck yeah, that's my plan.

Well, there you go. Oh, goodness. Now I just need to learn how to do all that.

[Speaker 3]
All right, what are we doing from here?

[Speaker 1]
The thing itself is magical, by the way. It is a magical apple cart.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, what does the cart do?

[Speaker 1]
Turns into a giant apple cart. And it just- Turns into a giant- Sorry, turns into a- a apple parrot.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's cute. Not much as it works.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing is that it preserves food.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want me to transfer all these potions into the party loot table? Sure. Yeah.

I just wanted to make sure no one was against it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so take what you want, people, and then I'm gonna tally up all the gold from the stuff that we don't take and put it up in the coins section.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna add some gold to the party shoot as well. What's up?

[Speaker 5]
I had said that I'll take any potions nobody wants.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
So I can learn to make them.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, never mind then.

[Speaker 4]
What does the long night tea do? Does it like make- Oh, there's a lot of fucking reading. It helps you stay awake.

It's Adderall. I'll take it. Unless you can- Unless you can- Unless your character can remake it and sell it to me at a decent price.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Anything that's a consumable? Oh, it's a consumable and non-magic.

But yeah, Kyrona can Alright, but I won't take it. Put these out at face price.

[Speaker 1]
If Kyrona would like to stay at the hollow and do some research. Yeah, in downtime.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yes, please.

[Speaker 3]
Can you do- You said you can't do magic ones or you can do magic ones?

[Speaker 5]
I can do magic ones. I picked up a magical crafting feat.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm gonna give you the one that I took.

[Speaker 5]
I can't do magical items in batches like you can for regular consumables.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm gonna give you the fairy dragon liqueur. Do you think you could make me one whenever you're able to?

[Speaker 5]
I can certainly try.

[Speaker 3]
Awesome, awesome. Damn.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm gonna try to start a guild.

[Speaker 3]
First it's a cult, now it's a guild.

[Speaker 4]
No, no, no, the cult! The cult comes later!

[Speaker 10]
I love your intro.

[Speaker 6]
We should pit our cults against one another and see who wins.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 4]
No, no, the cult is for the higher members. They have to pay to get into it.

[Speaker 3]
I have a character who's a cultist expert, by the way. He's an expert on cults. He researches cults.

[Speaker 5]
I'm out. Good night, guys.

[Speaker 3]
Good night! Yeah, Susurio, since he's from a cult, he likes to research cults so he can educate people on them so that they don't fall into those traps.

[Speaker 4]
What you're saying is I need to pay him off.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you can't. He's a monk. He does not value money like most people value money.

[Speaker 4]
So what I'm hearing is I need to steal him. I need to brainwash his ass. Good luck with that.

I need to read up on the rules on that and talk to Jane and stuff.

[Speaker 3]
Funny enough, priest wisdom isn't great.

[Speaker 4]
Very small steps. I'll start with hiring hirelings and stuff like that. Oh, can you help me with my level up, Astra?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, yeah, I got you, I got you. Can we do it tomorrow since I'm very, very tired? Yeah.

Awesome.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I'll put all of the stuff we haven't given into Bard's inventory since she's taking all the potions. In the meantime, there is some gold for folks. Let me do the calculations.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, I think James can just split it. You can click a button.

[Speaker 4]
Fuck yeah.

[Speaker 3]
But we can wait until he gets back to do that.

[Speaker 4]
I wonder if I can sell these bug carcasses.

[Speaker 6]
Well, it's a dead mosquito.

[Speaker 4]
So maybe. I'm sure there's some guy that wants to eat it.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you had to convince Kiwi not to. Dude, I really want a burrito right now. Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
A must-eat burrito. I might be able to sell it to one of those alchemists back in town. Maybe the mosquito bits are good for some sort of potion.

I'm not sure. I'm not aware of.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, well, once James gets back, I'll ask. We can split it. I'm so angry that that didn't work.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure how I feel about random encounters on 10-minute rests.

[Speaker 6]
It's normal. It's not all the time, but we just happen to be in a part where fairies are very active.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he also rolls for it. So sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Just because... Yeah, just because PF2E's... Its encounters are balanced around people being at full health and having stuff like focus spells back.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's just completely fragile and breaks entirely. I mean, it doesn't break. Listen, if I'm not at full fucking health and I don't have all my resources, then it's basically...

I mean, the battle's just totally turned against me. I don't think that's it. I wouldn't go that far.

That seems a little... That seems like a self-serving interpretation.

[Speaker 4]
I have a question, James. Yo. Would Castro know if any of the parts of these bugs would be use or worth something to alchemists?

[Speaker 1]
Tyrone is an alchemist, and she's trying to find that out right now. Or she's a crafter. What?

[Speaker 4]
I'm trying to sell them. I'm trying to make the party more money.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, listen. You could always try to harvest shit and... Okay.

[Speaker 3]
That'd be like a survival.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, survival's a good approach for that. I think if I move... the gold pieces...

[Speaker 4]
Would that be on the... What's it called? What?

Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
On your character sheet, look for the tab that has your proficiencies, and you will probably see a survival check there. There's also recall knowledge. Might have also been taken.

[Speaker 4]
Survival...

[Speaker 1]
19! It's definitely successful for something like this. There we go.

Manaia, make sure... Fuck yeah. Manaia's in, and then...

Uh... Where is Magus Chirona? Magus Chirona.

I think that worked.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, yippee.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. I have exactly 100 gold.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. I also have exactly 100 gold.

[Speaker 3]
What is the cost of living for, like, three weeks? Three weeks. So I can just go ahead and take that off of my...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there is cost of living.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, subsistence... Here we go.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. The Castro has exactly 100. I have 88.

Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Ha ha! I'm richer than you! Grovel!

[Speaker 3]
I have better stuff than you.

[Speaker 4]
That's true. What is it? What are we doing?

[Speaker 6]
Are we done for the day? Are there things that need to be divided and stuff?

[Speaker 3]
I believe we are done.

[Speaker 1]
I think we're done for the day. It's, uh... Very...

It's bedtime here in America.

[Speaker 3]
It is. 1 AM for me.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like 1.30. Oh dear.

[Speaker 6]
Well, goodnight then. Unfortunately, I am a bit busy this afternoon. Um, well, this afternoon here.

So, have a good night, everyone. Enjoy your dinner or sleep.

[Speaker 4]
You as well. I have one more question before I go, James. What's up, buddy?

Uh, what did I get for the 19?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. How many of these mosquitoes were there?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, good question. Eight, at least.

[Speaker 1]
There were 11.

[Speaker 4]
Ah! Oh yeah, there's one in my ass.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's probably the one that sucks. So you could split the... Beaks...

And the legs... With... With, uh...

Chirobo. Sorry, not the beaks, uh... Probiscus?

Probiscuses? Probiscite?

[Speaker 4]
Fine with that, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Probisky.

[Speaker 4]
And also, can I, uh, talk to you tomorrow about starting a guild? And how I'd go about that. I'm not trying to do it now, but I want to go about it.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah, yeah. Okay, great.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to be creating a character tomorrow. Just as a backup if I ever need, like, a... A lower level.

Um, so if we want to hop in, like, a chat tomorrow. So that you guys can talk about that. And I can ask questions.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, fuck yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 1]
I know. All I have to do tomorrow is file an answer for a lawsuit. And...

What the fuck?

[Speaker 4]
I thought you were working at an extermination company.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. Well, no, I do. I...

I do. Um... That's, like, work from home job.

So that's... And it has nothing to do... No, I'm...

I'm getting hit with a debt collection. Um... Alright, well.

That makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
We can file an answer and make it difficult for people. I don't think that number is correct.

[Speaker 3]
My mom was a debt collector for years. If you have any questions...

[Speaker 11]
I...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay. Okay, awesome.

I'll have my mom... I'm, um... Yeah, I'll ask her.

[Speaker 4]
I was at my doctor's appointment for the last, like, year and a half. I've been getting these letters saying, Hey! Pay this money!

And they finally said, Fuck you, we're not gonna let you in unless you pay this money. So I had to pay it yesterday. It was only $30.

[Speaker 3]
Um, but... My eye doctor's been calling me. They need $14 from me.

They're gonna get that $14, David. They're persistent.

[Speaker 1]
It's like... It's like using a payphone. And you go over the limit just a little bit.

Like, they call you... I think the operator used to, like, call them back. Like, call the payphone number.

Like, try to get you back on there.

[Speaker 4]
Would you consider that a consumable?

[Speaker 1]
Or a treasure? Right where you want them. For, like, the first time.

[Speaker 4]
James, would you consider that a consumable or a treasure? Oh, a treasure. Treasure, okay.

What was that, Silver?

[Speaker 2]
I said, I'm probably gonna head out now. I was gonna play with y'all. Y'all have a good night.

Oh, yeah, you do. Tattles!

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, yeah. Uh, if...

If my mom can help. She loves helping people with stuff like this. Because she hated her job so much.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 3]
She, um...

[Speaker 1]
It seems like a shitty job. Like, you're just sitting there calling people all day.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she said she, um... She listened to... She was doing medical stuff.

Oh, awesome. But she said that she, um... Had to listen to old people.

Determine whether or not they were gonna pay their bill. Buy their medicine. Or buy their groceries.

[Speaker 11]
Ooh.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Yeah. And so she got the hell out of that job.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That'd be a nightmare.

[Speaker 4]
You have to have, like, a really evil soul to... Like that job. So perfect for me.

I'm kidding. How much do those proboscis sell for?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, keep them at just, like, one... Actually, keep them at zero GP for the moment.

[Speaker 4]
Sound good. And then... Add another item.

Ba-ba-ba-ba. Uh... Oh, that's the wrong one.

Ugh. Man, I'm going for a nice long walk tomorrow. I'm so happy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, god. There you go.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, folks.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's bedtime for everybody. Y'all have a fantastic evening. Thanks for playing.

[Speaker 4]
Good evening. Yep, see you then. Thank you.

See you tomorrow. Yep, bye.

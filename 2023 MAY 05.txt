[Speaker 1]
You could find yourself coming back from the load at the exact same time that you left, or you could find yourself coming back with a great deal of time having passed, or even just a The cardinal will add, oh, or perhaps a regular amount of time And as a shrugs, it's very This is just normal shit to Kyrona.

[Speaker 6]
She has no suggestions because she doesn't see a problem with it

[Speaker 3]
I like the randomness

[Speaker 4]
Well, the only way we're going to get there is if we Start our track So

[Speaker 1]
We best, if you got any more questions Get them asked quick because Cardinal will be, Cardinal will be joining you, obviously, see Valyria We've discussed most of her updates

[Speaker 4]
Reasonable

[Speaker 1]
Yeah

[Speaker 4]
He probably would be able to navigate the world better than any of us could with his eyes blindfolded

[Speaker 1]
Please, Valyria is the guy

[Speaker 4]
Well, he'd still probably do a fair job better than me

[Speaker 1]
That sounds like an impressive But I will be coming with you

[Speaker 4]
Well, I suppose it is Presenting of me that Yeah, let's get on going

[Speaker 1]
Are you ready to move on?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I'm ready All right, I'm guessing you folks are gonna use the teleportation circle Yes All right, so para folds over everybody with her cloak which extends outwards kind of wraps everybody up into Both as thin as a rag And you find yourselves in a now rather crowded department And a high-class area of Asheros hmm There's a bearish looking dwarf. Are you sleeping a passed out drunk on the couch?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, para leads them out Waving at the the dwarf on her way out Doesn't matter if he sees or not Tell her to tiptoes out.

[Speaker 1]
He knows better than to wake a drunk Yeah Just following along All right, so should we get like a bird whistle Arnold says oh, that's a really yeah, why?

[Speaker 5]
Well, I can't make a bird sound

[Speaker 1]
But like I said, I don't like being imposed upon but many of her So Bolivia's ballot has something to do with Has something to do with I was never at the attentive one, you know, and I wasn't there of course for the original the original enactment But Just having items that can produce music in general is handy for the while you're in the world There's creatures you could trade such things due to information

[Speaker 6]
absolutely, if I thought my familiar had mimic, but she doesn't Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're good so anything perhaps a harmonica anything that can I Would rent most of our birds produce three notes a PC and I do need a new pan flute How much is one of those I I think according to Actually, according to one of the new players who's looking this up. I think a pan flute is literally 12 gold Okay If we're going to the market on our way, I'll grab one Seems incredibly high.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like tell her not almost said the wrong characters name I feel like Kyrona could probably just like make one as we walk through the woods I'm sure you could but fine Yeah Anyways, you guys can write down a collection of if you want to spend like five gold you could also write down a small collection of bird whistles Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do It was annoying. Um, any whistle slide whistle things?

[Speaker 5]
Omatone I think the tomatones.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you mean like the the little slide whistles the Yeah Although I think they're We don't have anybody with What they could sing the notes for us Well, I'm proficient with the pan flute so maybe those Other flutes I can See what I can do with We'll do fine.

[Speaker 1]
Close. You guys have some whistles The Cardinal is ready to get going so For travel you guys have two days. All you guys need is two successful tracks Or a number of successful checks that balance out after failing checks counter them Successful in order to write to a destination without facing any encounters

[Speaker 7]
Okay, wrong token my yeah, that's

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here So there's a bunch of different roles that you could take on Exploration you also of course have the choice of not rolling at all But they offer you certain benefits depending on class I think let's see Topo you're a sorcerer warlock, right? That's correct, and then yo-yo, what are you?

Ranger Ranger, so you guys Can scroll down to your respective classes to see the specific benefits where you would get for calling us with roll And then there are of course descriptions of the rolls I Don't know if we're doing a whole lot of hunting or fishing while we're doing it While we're traveling. Yeah, probably not the Otherwise would be Vanguard.

[Speaker 2]
I think would be them one of No, I want us to not get lost because it's a general role isn't it Well, do you get that in addition to Pacific ones? Not really sure

[Speaker 4]
No, Vanguard is the one that looks out for things sneaking up on you

[Speaker 2]
Yeah

[Speaker 4]
Survivalist is the one for getting us to the place

[Speaker 2]
Or yeah, yeah, I kind of want to avoid getting lost

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna take camper the first day if that's okay and Cook on the second day Because on the second day if we get a hearty rest I can give you guys one of my Eldritch Invocations and I can give you devil's sight which is a hundred and twenty feet dark vision

[Speaker 4]
Do we have to select a different one for both days?

[Speaker 1]
No Yeah, so you would just choose one Go with that. I think and that would mean that would be your role for the journey. I could take tracker.

Oh I see real quick. So far the that benefit would apply If you guys didn't use it beforehand that benefit would apply at the conclusion of your journey if you wanted to want to make use and It wouldn't be like on and then wasted on the on the first day. I'm not sure I understand why were you why were you trying was the reason you were trying to split up the role for the first day in the second day because it does say They can use it before finishing their next long rest hmm, yeah, so Party rest each of the party rest is kind of like the travel was really good and it was Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks. I could probably be camper because I can make us undetected while we're missing that might be good idea Because nothing in this is gonna help us keep on yeah, I'm Stay on the path for some whatever reason So you wouldn't worry about the benefit expiring?

[Speaker 1]
after the after the Okay, okay, so no, yeah, we do survivalists give me two checks

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I can add my if this is to If this is to avoid game detector or anything like that I can use survival dice as well Yes, indeed Okay, what checking it

[Speaker 1]
So this is done for natural acquisitions origin the first one is canvassing you could either use perception or survival and appraising a history or nature You do early so you would only

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, let's do survival first Up, not by that. I pissed the wrong button.

I hope it up tips who gives me that's not what I was meant to piss him okay, uh, all right, and Yeah, I'll throw survival down there for it's in giggles. We can find the damn thing. There we go.

Oh Wow, a dirty 20 nice. Okay, and then need to check as well Okay Yeah, I definitely want to add a couple of guys with that I Don't know how many die can add two things Okay more than one die or Use your best judgment How are you gonna die? because 14 isn't exactly high.

It's a bit dated 24.

[Speaker 1]
Where's also six. All right, would you like to have something from me? two rolls in the common table for forging results or one roll on the One for me or for someone else for you for me out there Already go ahead and roll d20 in the meantime the shock.

Oh, I need you to make a check for Vanguard I'm guessing that's perception Usually yes, I need more to make a check with cooking utensils I Don't have Proficiency.

[Speaker 6]
So what do I roll?

[Speaker 1]
Proficiency, uh, you could roll. I mean you can roll a number of things Okay, I'll go with wisdom. Okay ability Madison maybe oh It would be with cooks utensils Ability or safe Thinking ability.

Oh, yes for the oh, that's what doesn't think it. Oh Remember you can expend rations to reroll. Oh Good do that That's much better Then pair are you like I burned the first pot because I Wasn't watching it and I have to start over Do you like pick out some memories and just start dumping them into new?

What is now perpetual stew?

[Speaker 5]
Can I do? Entertainment using insight Yes All right. I'll go for that one then Is the rations thing one per person or is it one per party one per person?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm gonna reroll that Very easy way of getting people to buy and expend rations Sure the false of doing survivalists, I probably would have hunted some stuff along the way Yeah, I rolled a two on the D to me so not great Depends I Perception He's not go right.

[Speaker 1]
Wait. Why are you rolling a second perception? I Thought we were doing two days.

It's just one for the whole journey Okay, 29 is good. Absolutely So you guys aren't gonna have to worry about anything you get a hearty rest We're just gonna result in a grand total 600 XP.

[Speaker 2]
Oh It's perfect about adding that to the thing, what should we get from that battle and see 5183 so just add that to What I had started with I assume eight Three and how should we get from this? Travel this travel two days 300 XP for the hearty rest Okay, 600 So it's accepted, okay Okay, also by the by I didn't get that Magical longbow, you know, I Am I mean to make that myself or what? Oh, that's pretty simple.

[Speaker 1]
It just deals an extra 2d 10 cold damage and Here's the result for your Thing All right, so you folks make it over to It to where Leary is nesting grounds Yeah, it is a large clearing with quite a few golden flowers Which are some flowers daisies More or less just a meadow that looks In front of you folks and standing in the middle of this metal a half arch We have about three primary vines twisted Into into again this half art structure.

They are blue green and red Every time they catch sunlight or every time the ray of sunlight through the clouds get a little bit Right. You get a little glimpse of these fade lights that appeared it That appear in the space between right, but they look flat like they're not actually there like a section of some sort

[Speaker 7]
Hmm

[Speaker 1]
Standing near this is a wizard very obvious very obvious because just a 20 hat robes of the whole deal Who I think is the only person who is at this wizard recognizes him as core core again Is it what hi Oh, oh you have new friends. Hello greetings Don't I'm a Mage from Escher Elsie.

This is nice to meet you all Wow, man Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well What's she doing at the gate? Oh Just investigating.

I've been looking for you. I've been looking for more potential Sun Shrine I've been also just enjoying the opportunity Investigate the area since the frost has abated in this area for a little bit that was there was something of a close call not too long ago, but Quite happy And everything seems to calm down

[Speaker 5]
I think it's just beginning

[Speaker 1]
Really hoping that you wouldn't do something like It's coming from you, I think I Learned to trust your husband all this by the very least your predictions

[Speaker 6]
It could always be worse

[Speaker 5]
Do not well now it's gonna be worse

[Speaker 4]
Jinx Oh Forgive them.

[Speaker 1]
They know not what they say But I oh you have a you have a thing I Almost didn't and you were doing that thing with a you to a blind spot for Part of says, oh, yes. Yes, of course Now that you've caught me out on it everyone in this party will know I Appreciate this so much This is can I have your name? a organs a your mother a Panther back and forth hot second.

All right. So what what does this say? What is this Faye doing?

[Speaker 4]
He's just hanging out.

[Speaker 1]
Yes Traveling with us. All right. Are you folks going through the gate?

[Speaker 5]
Ideally, yeah. Yeah, we have business on the other side Hopefully helpful business That's encouraging.

[Speaker 1]
I Wish you folks luck Be safe. I think I've had a few sensors. There is I Believe there's a rather large bird On the other side, but it's not been happy.

It's also a castle or fort of sorts To the to the direct South be wary. I don't know who the occupant you wary You won't think I can open this for you folks. Maybe Sounds like a fantastic be helpful.

[Speaker 7]
That would be nice All right.

[Speaker 1]
Well He snaps his fingers a little bit of golden light appears on the center of the portal and very quickly the scene starts spilling out from a crack in the air of Out of this portal look like there is still a golden meadow on the other side, but there's bushes with lights for leaves a forest with no apparent horizon the more you look up and up and like you look out and you could see a couple of tree tops isn't on our Elevation, but every time you try to like look up to see the sky beyond it Like it just continues the forest basically continues upward Morgan says don't focus on it too much.

[Speaker 4]
It'll give you it'll give you Hopefully we're not going to have to go too high up.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no, no Forest the world obscures Best of luck. Don't get killed out there checking with me about the about How to check in with me within the month I will likely have up it hmm, we'll see you on the other side You know if we survive Well, hopefully we'll see you on this side again.

[Speaker 4]
Also Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
That wasn't exactly an answer Since you folks seem so dour.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just just go inside. Just you'll be fine.

[Speaker 6]
I am now gladly instantly suspicious Can I roll insight?

[Speaker 1]
You see it's pretty genuinely perturbed at how Sarcastic the party is about survival.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not being sarcastic. I'm being Realistic again. We're going into the great danger and Adventure Okay, which Person upstairs that I pissed off today X Exasperated type deal more or less But anyways, we go I go through the portal Already.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm right behind you Are instantly met with a breath of somehow even fresher air earthy in a way that threatens to tend to Recently fallen and quite warm rain fills up your nostrils And then leaves to make room for the scent of nearby fruits that it looked quite appealing Ricardo stretches his legs and stretches his up to this point hidden wings

[Speaker 6]
He's so nice to be home I want to investigate was it a bush or a tree that had lights for leaves It was a bush did they keep glowing if I pick one

[Speaker 1]
Usually you have to pick So sometimes yes But it has to be ripe and you have to leave an offering if the like feed the bush and some Oh They usually don't last outside the pay what

[Speaker 6]
Well, I will take like half a dozen and leave a hank of hair

[Speaker 1]
It's like a school with that the bush is very much I

[Speaker 6]
Specifically thank the bush it glows them.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Just Morse code But now that a Good question.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure how we don't expect exactly. Oh, yeah, I know we're doing, you know But is it uneven or and do things like that apply?

[Speaker 1]
It's definitely uneven yes, okay Before you Okay I Okay, continue yeah, no, no happy trails definitely like There's certain things that help people get XP at different time else Now it's different active Okay, yeah, I'm still trying to figure out the whole this much thing No worries, man What's up, I Thought it's I don't know I wasn't saying anything else. I don't think you know what I said in it Okay Colonel stretches that it says I suppose I am Looking you've gotten me this far Obliged to give you at least one tip Which is to take out take out those little bird whistles. They bought earlier Okay, if you are looking for anything that has to do with Valeria's guest Code you folks wouldn't know I would prefer to say the song CBF FCB what I'd love how attentive you are and then he flies off CBF CBF FCB CBF Okay Shall we Proceed forward every once in a while playing those notes.

[Speaker 3]
That sounds good.

[Speaker 2]
I'll try to hum along I'm gonna keep I'm gonna look out for any animals booze and such that might be around and I've given the opportunity.

[Speaker 1]
I would want to talk to one of them and see if they have If they know of any way that they hear music coming from on a regular basis just to point us in the general direction already, so you guys Tune it seems a little off-kilter As you guys move along a lot of the birds around you actually you do see quite a few of them But a lot of them are actually scared. I Scream at you briefly a few of them try to grab Whistles from your mouth before they leave what kind of birds All of them are birds of paradise There are a few Corvettes around here that look like crows but are largely blue in color. I Would like to take Paris advice and change the tune.

I'm playing There is an instant shift in the atmosphere as all of a sudden the birds are considerably And occasionally joined to sing along you also feel as if the path that you guys have been taking out of the meadow Hasn't changed at all in terms of direction But you feel as if you're suddenly going a different still seems to be a relatively straight line

[Speaker 6]
Um Can I roll Nature to determine why the birds were upset I Could do animal handling like were they upset because we were doing the right thing or because we were doing the wrong thing.

[Speaker 4]
I Think I misplayed the notes She didn't misplay the notes.

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm looking in the chat Yeah, like I said, I miss remembered the note there you're No, I'm saying I misremembered the note a pair pointed out I got you now Now I'm this earn so Yeah, you could go animal and then Animal handling is probably good for Robin to play Yeah, that's a sir. Oh Hi, that's All right, so Robin you'll get a few of them to light you a light on your shoulder Verona Understands the see here. How am I gonna phrase this?

Okay You get the sense Especially since you've been traveling in the world for a while. You've been here before your patron is from here. This is not a It's not a Curiosity folks So, you know looking at the birds that they were one almost certainly perturbed by playing the wrong tune but also there's probably something else going on the their initial aggressive response Indicates that there's some kind of natural event or unnatural event that's happened nearby.

That's the way disturbed their nests But they are particularly agitated and anything that does agitate them Produces a little bit more of an angry response rather than whereas beforehand. They might just think All right.

[Speaker 6]
Why am I unsurprised that the card don't lie to us? Yeah, shall I break out speak with animals or does somebody else have it money use I can do it as well and I Can do it for free. All right Why do you think he lied?

So, um birds upset because we're doing the wrong thing and not the right thing That's because I played the wrong tune at first All right.

[Speaker 2]
So this primary awareness and we get to cast each of them once per day for freeze It's imaginative Yes Do do do do do do versus kind of like staring I'll repeat what I just said.

[Speaker 1]
It's imaginative That was the that was the birds answer was wait. Did you not hear me?

[Speaker 2]
Ah No, no, I didn't hear you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Sorry Over here.

[Speaker 2]
So what the birds that the bird said?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, or a little eel. She sleeps often.

[Speaker 2]
We've come to see your Lord. Perhaps we can help And you Wait, what was that? Could you've been to a nest?

Mint oh I think you cut out. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I think you cut out for us. I didn't hear what I Know I'm sure we could Okay, it seems very excited. It just flies off.

You get a large contingent of birds also flying off the branches and Holding themselves into like the swarm that's flying around and you hear Hundred tiny voices shouting shortcut shortcut shortcut Swarm this Good.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll change the list of the party and say They're leading us to their lady It's a shortcut.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I'll relax You folks keep walking and in about five minutes form grows thick enough with no longer And it's right at me. Aha

[Speaker 2]
Hey, you are cutting in and out a little bit

[Speaker 1]
Up and down

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, yeah

[Speaker 1]
so It's right at the it's right at this threshold of like literally so thick that you can't see the path around you that you Feel like a little bit of like I could best describe it as a jump or a dip that you weren't expecting when you Step up that like when you go up the last step of stairs But you think that there's one more because I know you're hearing something or you can't see it and you put like a foot up Expecting for another one to be there, but there isn't And Disperses in an instant and you folks find yourselves in front of a that's described as a fort It looks like a mostly conventional fort or castle except it's distinctly smoother Quite a few vine motifs that are running up the side. It looks to have been grown based off its wooden construction, but it still has a Metallic or mineral sheen and as if what there is it actually can put rock or silver Is there an obvious door Indeed, I will not Whistle the correct Little key phrase of music Just before we move forward door light up All receptacle.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
I think we should approach carefully perhaps Tribute hello It's not Listed as one of the options Could I use druid craft to just make like a handful of berries to give the birds?

[Speaker 2]
I could use this doing Yeah, the two of you could work together Yeah, we're doing make some trail mix.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah You start working with true craft together. Basically that Robin is supplementing the Feeding basically berries Or a little bit of trail mix into the spell Magic is quite a little bit of fun. It's a little bit here here just on the count of Leaving the spell with her Commended you can actually see the lines of magic beam on out of there Before they condense into something realm it All the birds flutter around you guys are now covered in a small array of feathers

[Speaker 7]
Thank you for helping us

[Speaker 4]
How is the receptacle in the door

[Speaker 1]
Very small It is about the size of I would say it is about as wide as a Probably about one inch tall there's gonna put a bird whistle in it You're a soft of blow off like I Guess you feel a soft wind blow out the receptacle And that's just a little bit of the whistles tune, but the whistles

[Speaker 7]
Hmm

[Speaker 6]
Um, I have a Torch in my inventory my role some crafting die to make that in to like take the wood and magically make Just like a beautiful abstract bird figuring I

[Speaker 1]
Don't know if that would you could I don't know if that was fit in the receptacle

[Speaker 4]
Okay Be enterable into that receptacle

[Speaker 1]
I'd like to try that Same result as the whistle

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think I pick up my pan flute Do we want to try putting a hand in there

[Speaker 3]
Can't we just say

[Speaker 1]
Anybody home look around is anything else of note if you're a whistle on the other side back pretty much in the same

[Speaker 4]
Should we reply in kind yeah, let's player was my pan flute I'd like to play my pan flute in the correct correct note.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that might be the way to go that up.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Somebody appears at the top of the wall You look over at the spot that you previously thought was an opening Hello Good morning to you It's not often I see And on a most curious day of reunion, how did you come here shortcut? Aha, yes, I see. Hmm.

Oh Yeah, I could say I could tell by this scattering convert them Go by the clip. Tell you what if the you guys I get the birds I suppose we See what you're about Take a handful of them put them in there Feathers like take the feathers and put them in the safety off. Yeah, I'd like to gently do so along with Robin already The receptacle stamps down on the feathers and they gain a little bit of an iridescent sheen.

I've been five and And then the door open You know in hindsight, there's so much more of these than it should be Say I love you Mm-hmm We shall So there is a rather large aviary within here a village more expensive or I shouldn't even say village. It's it's Of the sophistication of a city, but there are very few actual buildings probably less than 20 But they all happen to be Number of flying creatures around here. Most of them are a fey with wings on their back So they are of course struggling But they appears of struggling around there.

The birds are doing markedly better see Torment of about 20 minute arms come up and rather important official looking Hey approach black wings blue crest and red shoulder pads on Well state your business here not often that we have mortal wisdom I say I think we're here to help I Hear that your lady's misters and disappear. Yes. Yes, it is.

Let's see all around this Is there anything we can do to help Supposedly you came to help us we heard that Give me a second.

[Speaker 4]
I need to take a drink out of character.

[Speaker 2]
I'm saying this May we ask what caused the damage to cure Like you said that again Can we ask what caused the damage to occur we have the come How did it happen not Not being a smart Alec.

[Speaker 6]
Um, just being genuine. Have you tried writing it down?

[Speaker 1]
He looks at you with like genuine dumbfounded Because then you'll know what happened Okay, why don't we go talk to her Like snaps out of the little taken home resisting the urge to make Anyways, we're following along Excellent. So they take you past the primary building Open Alice only be reached by flight And in the side and a small waterfall is filling up It doesn't it does look true to him it does look like a nest Hmm our Guard captain the guards say normally we would just carry you up. I'm going to meet Take one of those feathers each a piece and take a bite out of tasty.

[Speaker 4]
All right Makes no sense to me

[Speaker 1]
It has the consistency of cotton candy and tastes like chicken

[Speaker 5]
Alarming yeah chicken floss

[Speaker 1]
So you folks begin floating upwards the half of your own accord you get those Little bit but the direction, you know from side to side, but the direction you were going in is up Once you go fight guys go up what felt like only about Three stories that you knew this thing to be higher when you approach the bottom of this looked as Closer until it was only All Cliff but feasibly jump off of it water or something like load up word once you reach the landing area Several of the guardsmen make your own as you I'm do looks as if several miles Of

[Speaker 3]
awesome Is it a beautiful magnificent magnificent say only it's a nice thing

[Speaker 1]
The guardsmen are going to lead you up the stairs into a chamber room where the guard and ready Give an entry hand it over to me Our captain well And you see a throw that is a once again like yes and Rather uncharacteristically pale looking creature sitting with number of Feathers on her arms and from her back as well.

[Speaker 2]
She doesn't know they all look saturated Even with thrown around Greetings your ladyship kind of do a bit of a balance was We've come to aid you in your time of need We hear that you are well That has who can help lady Turns her head away.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe In here by way of shortcuts looks to say something else but then relents As she her ears do perk up at the she stands up. Come on we Stumbling looking she has a small and diminished presence. I can't Make up for the fact that she's roughly 10 feet Hours big bird learning.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna step forward Fair lady we have traveled far to aid you However, we may end this ailment we are at your service Until the time comes for us to leave the world wasn't more if you can give us any information And I I kind of pulled out The notebook that I have

[Speaker 1]
Hoping she closes The cap of the garden our lady does And Valeria passion behind her towards the top outs out of the Also looking like the clouds here, by the way, look almost cartoon They look like French curves French swarms in the sky with act with like a shading on outside like cotton candy Fill in like an outline Color they look like somebody cotton candy to fill in balance of a covering It just didn't cover He's blow aside and a mountain she see and he's My memory is short. She does this every time one of her pets Can you tell us anything about that pet Yes, I believe the human work for a rock. She has a rock as a pet Oh This is far from the weirdest thing in the Feywild Indeed a giant bird does seem like a good pet No Telqua has high charisma, but it's not too bright.

[Speaker 5]
I Thought it was a mineral rock I only know because this has come up in every campaign.

[Speaker 4]
I Have ever had there's always a rock and every time I say, oh, yeah, there's a big bird It's a rock and they all think it's a statue Well, it could be just the rock she uses out of character I'm saying this it could be just the rock she uses to Being people she don't like wait, wait, wait, wait is is pet rock an intentional pun Why would I ever reveal such a thing?

[Speaker 1]
There's no fun, I love you Can we get a description of this pet rock well, it's said to have a Healing it's said to have healed.

[Speaker 2]
I see I have something has happened to the rock Hence why the lady's feeling unwell Well, who's up for hiking?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we have not been able to approach or Magnificent.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, naturally Liria.

[Speaker 1]
So Best of luck, but if you make it to the nest

[Speaker 6]
That's it doesn't taste like chicken

[Speaker 1]
Hmm already, so what I want to do is I'm gonna take like a 10 20 minute break in a bathroom That's mostly what it's worth And then I'll be good to continue if you guys are

[Speaker 4]
I didn't need to know that was actually a thing

[Speaker 5]
What the chicken floss yes chicken floss is amazing man, no, you're kidding

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, pork floss is good, too Is that anything related to chicken granules or whatever they call it?

[Speaker 5]
No, it's just like it's just like like really nicely cooked chicken so it's kind of like almost like a like a really fine jerky Oh Okay Bad Yeah, it's it's like a it's definitely like a really thin strand jerky It's used a lot in like Chinese cuisine specifically.

[Speaker 4]
It's really good on sandwiches and stuff So it's kind of shredded shredded and dried or something yeah And Could you imagine seeing a bird actually that big otter Because that rock formation is making me think of bird for some reason. I should hope it makes you think of a bird I looked up bird-shaped rock Could you imagine seeing a live bird that big all birds are that big to me Hmm well, I suppose Paris definition of a big bird would be slightly different than ours Once we get up there locate this thing I got locate object and Our Ranger friend. Oh wait.

They're not level 13 yet Perry you got locate creature Who have locate creature no I was asking not around that one.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, so I do have locate creature.

[Speaker 2]
Yes On that front Think once we get up there You know birds tend to see their feathers often so as long as we can approach the nest we'll probably be able to find some straight feathers easily enough I Can sneak up there, so that shouldn't be too. I think we have feathers Right yeah, but we need rock feathers That's the point of the quest I think do then try not to get killed And I think we only need one but probably might want to get multiple if we can happen depends on how big the feathers are If the rock is a rock I think it is it's a big it's probably person-sized feathers I'd say Yeah Do it the bag of holding or anything like that? Does that make it easier to?

[Speaker 5]
You know that is the one thing I keep thinking. Oh, I should buy one and then I never do oh

[Speaker 4]
How much is a bag of holding by the way found of the gold a

[Speaker 2]
Thousand gold 500 I think oh 500 yeah, they're not super terribly expensive last time cheap, but The uncommon items, I think Yes Depends on who you ask yes uncommon so should be somewhere between 100 500 gold so 500 would be the top end of them I

[Speaker 5]
Don't remember exactly what James uses for pricing magic items, but I know it is by rarity

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, if he's using sane magic pricing, then it'll be around 2,500

[Speaker 5]
Well up to 5,000 if you what does sane put boots of the winterlands at? Around 2,500 Okay, yeah, it's gonna be a different one because I think I spent like oh Gosh hundred and fifty hundred and fifty feels like it's really low, but I feel like it was something like that Yeah, I think very gentle on the the price of magic items Yeah, yeah, if it's a normal pricing it's about two thousand five hundred if it's saying prices.

[Speaker 2]
It's around ten thousand so

[Speaker 4]
Probably so figure max and for goggles of night to be around 2,500

[Speaker 2]
I'm not really sure they do Night vision oh those oh, oh, that's if it's a start this one goggles and Then Yeah, they're uncommon out there, so yeah, I don't know about 500 gold so they'll be about the same price as Thank you, so 500 base for from the DMT up to 1,500

[Speaker 5]
for same prices so so for this one does everyone have Devil's sight I think from

[Speaker 2]
Yes

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, cuz cuz she mentioned um We're like any shade of dark vision does it only do dark vision, or is it also magical darkness

[Speaker 2]
It is only Hey, what does magical darkness? It was I did so does both magical dark vision and and regular darkness as well Yeah That's great Up to under 20 feet so it's really good Yeah So I'm not since I got the devil's thing.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not gonna be a giant going target Mm-hmm oh it does say both magical and not Yeah, I have that my blocking another game.

[Speaker 2]
It's good. I can cast darkness noun you all now Yeah, and we could not see anything and you get to attack with advantage here Oh, don't we get Devil's side as well Yeah, I think I how Gave it to us Yeah for the cooking check Did not pick up on that, but here's breaking out a lot for me, so Seems that connections are very good. I don't know why I Mean you guys can hear me just fine.

I'm not breaking up Emma.

[Speaker 3]
No Yeah, I thought it was Not ideal, but is what it is Foundry question when How do you put your token on a map you just drag it from the character?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah, yeah I don't know if James is gonna have to give you permission for that if he already has it set so that everyone has permission Did you set everything up in your token image your prototype token I tried So when you're in your sheet at the very top there's a prototype token thing you should be able to do that one And that should be where you put the image for your thing. It looks like your profile and your token image got swapped

[Speaker 3]
Yeah

[Speaker 5]
Because When I hover over you I get your profile image, which is the circular image Yeah, so you want to put that one in your prototype token and then I mean honestly you don't really need to change the profile image you can if you want to but Also with the prototype token Under resources There is a thing that says like display bars never displayed if you could be a doll and put that to Display when hovered for everyone Because I use that when I'm trying to decide who I'm healing And once you're all done with that, you will have to redrag your character onto the map in order to see the changes Okay, I see the the bar but it looks like the image is still the same

[Speaker 3]
Okay

[Speaker 2]
I'm a dum-dum

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so when you're looking at your prototype token under appearance There should be a thing called image path and that's where you select the image for it Is that where you've been trying to change it from?

Yeah, I have noticed that sometimes when trying to update things You have to do it a couple times before it actually like the X and I I just think that's just a funny little quirk of Foundry foundry.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I've never had it an issue in foundry, but I'm also usually the GM so I don't know It's much different when you're hosting off your own computer Yeah Updating lancers, I notice whenever I'm updating an image for Items or skills or anything like that. I've always got to do it twice before takes. I don't know bloody why but it does Super fucking annoying And you need to Remove the other one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so I don't know Okay, so it's the file that I'm selecting because I can select a different file and it works fine. So my my file Does it only work with JPEGs or does it work with pings as well?

[Speaker 5]
I exclusively use PNG so It shouldn't matter if it's a JPEG PNG, I think even web MPs work You need PNG though Like if you want the token to have like transparent edges, you gotta have PNG.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I just it just worked I have no idea what I did differently So, there you go, well problem solved successfully It's like when you are putting a USB stick in you always got to flip it around a couple times before it finally goes in So has anyone ever used the tracking skill During wilderness travel.

[Speaker 5]
I did once and it was the best thing I ever did

[Speaker 3]
Okay

[Speaker 5]
Because when I have because I'm a cleric when I do tracking for the exploration There is like a star that goes above the target and We happen to be doing one where we were specifically trying to find the white dragons actually for Corrigan So we had like a handy-dandy little like quest marker everywhere we went

[Speaker 3]
I didn't understand

[Speaker 5]
What's your class

[Speaker 3]
On a successful check you detect a hidden way along you can change it. Oh, no, it's a cracker the Fisher placeholder Fisher when successfully fish you can choose to open a pocket space to send it in Whenever you fit afterwards, you can choose to send the creature back in Replacing one role with the creature that considers that the positive creature

[Speaker 2]
That's Confusing as well

[Speaker 4]
Profitable I

[Speaker 5]
Think what it basically is is like using a fish you caught as bait for a bigger fish

[Speaker 2]
Sounds like I can imagine thing.

[Speaker 4]
So You insert smaller fish get bigger fish in return.

[Speaker 3]
I See, I see. So it's I'm using sardine to get a halibut and a halibut to get a shark or something There you go. My cooking benefit is a bonus to saving throws it looks like To avoid spell effects For what I did for the entertaining thing Everybody has advantage on death saving throws Let's hope we don't have to use it Well, you ready to make a journey ready Let's go hiking.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go find a feather Let's go Fly a kite up to the highest tide I suppose Hmm, I'm trying to purchase them. Yeah, you're begging a real bad for me.

[Speaker 1]
All right, let's try now Better just my game as well. Make sure I'm not going in and out so the capital guard is going to trail that people attempted to use beforehand and Warns you that the way is fraught with danger. Obviously If you stick to the trail, however Take enough overgrowth That you can at the very least avoid being carried off by a rock Oh Sounds like fun times Interesting, how long does it take to get to the top?

[Speaker 4]
I'm something Oh We'll get there when we get there Shall we The sooner we get going the sooner we can get to the top.

[Speaker 3]
Does anybody have a feather fall spell?

[Speaker 2]
That I don't know We've got the other Chicken floss feathers Yeah, let's hold on to one of them each just in case we need to Yeah Not dying Yeah, anyways, let's head on up quietly preferably Does anyone got away from me to be quieter I Do but it just why I asked how long it would take and I probably take longer than It would it won't last long enough. Yeah, I think I can do one out So, yeah Attempt to be sneaky Yeah Well, we'll need a more club when we get closer when we're this far out. It's not gonna be a mess here once we get to the undergrowth Overgrowth, whatever we should be fine Yeah, when we make our approach to the nice then well you know Now pull up the Quiet journey so far.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah Should we keep whistling the BCD Probably not necessary.

[Speaker 2]
I think I really need that to get through the tower.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think we need a big Broadcasting our position Mm-hmm I will give you guys preliminary information though. This is going to be a skill challenge going to be There are eight steps to it Mm-hmm and are mostly going to put ground

[Speaker 3]
Maybe we could turn those into charisma skill checks

[Speaker 4]
I'm willing to do any perception survival or athletics checks that come up

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're gonna need your athletics because I ain't got that

[Speaker 3]
I Was healthy parts I can do

[Speaker 6]
I've got Nature And survival Persuasion so if the rock kidnaps me I can ask it to nicely put me down I also got a religion and persuasion also, but he said more physical.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, and I also got medicine

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, is there any way and foundry for me to see your Character sheets or I think it's per person only

[Speaker 5]
My main top three skills are insight medicine and perception

[Speaker 4]
my top three Athletics perception and persuasion unnecessarily in that order

[Speaker 2]
My top one would be animal handling Perception stealth and survival Okay, what do you say yours was to come

[Speaker 3]
Persuasion insight perception and arcana Which none of which are going to be valuable?

[Speaker 1]
I'm guessing Yeah I Had like when me Jocko typed up his thing I had that like, right Okay, the quote-unquote correct sequence like typed in I was like, oh wait no I Mean I was gonna correct him sooner, but my hands are covered in barbecue sauce Oh, no, you know, by the way the bulgogi recipe that you sent me that was Delicious, I'm gonna use it for burgers for American fashion.

[Speaker 5]
I Mean I've done worse Debatably, but yeah, I love her bulgogi recipe Did you do the one with the pear or did you just do like the easy one? I did the one with the pear It does so much for the flavor I Think so much of cooking.

[Speaker 1]
I keep realizing is like actual like I don't know chemistry like really simple chemistry Like fruit is tastier a lot of fruits if you sprinkle a little bit of salt on them Hmm, which is which was completely counterintuitive to me. But like I tried to I was like what the hell that's a lot of fun Okay It's ready to get going you folks stand at the basically the entrance to a tunnel of Trees that go up and up and up and you can see it snake around and we see it literally serpentine fashion up the mountain and The way your eyes perceive space here is itself bent. You could see a little bit around the corners Your perception extends almost like a blind sight to a little bit around some of these corners well, let's see a Drawback, it might not be able to see us, but we won't be able to see it Well, I mean, maybe it has some sort of like thing about this that it can see I mean it lives here.

[Speaker 3]
So yeah Gonna be hard to get surprised. That's for sure We're not trying to kill us We're just wanting a feather. It's still a feather.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Yeah, and we don't even have to find it. We just need to find its nest. Sure.

[Speaker 1]
Oh have plenty of loose feathers strewn about but anyways already the Thing next year takes out a silver pocket watch and starts it. Well Best of luck. I recommend you get running to go.

Let's get going running Oh Ready so It's up the very first role that I'm gonna have you folks make is a constitution saving throw or check Whichever you prefer Just one of us Mine was crap Um our Constitution saves that I something I can use my herb dice for I Everyone gets plus five if they're within ten feet of me Good.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay And the answer I believe is yes Okay, I'm gonna use a couple of herb dice for Robin and Corona Yeah, I'm gonna need that.

[Speaker 2]
I Don't suppose riding my wolf around helps with me in any way.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, have it make the same instead I Asked a good question.

[Speaker 2]
The question is does it have a bit of save than I do I doubt it. I seriously doubt it Nope, it's save is the same as mine.

[Speaker 5]
So it makes no damn difference Okay, Kairana gets the three and then Robin gets the five Thank you That puts me at 17 with Tara and Who was it?

[Speaker 2]
They put me With the two bonuses, yeah Though I don't think Lance stride helps in this in any way with it Difficult rain doesn't matter to me at all. I think it matters. I don't think that's what chicken for but This is just sheer physical exertion.

[Speaker 1]
I assume Okay, so and I have that in mind First challenge is up ahead. The way is fraught with separations and fissures in the ground I need somebody to Let's see. Oh, no, I'm not supposed to suggest something There's a lot of fissures and like I said a cracks in the ground Some of them are partially overgrown with vines, but the but your footing is not nearly as stable as it was I've got a Survival check perhaps.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah sounds like survival and I've got rope if that would maybe give us an advantage Okay I'm looking for for a path that's the clearest way through to Not get tripped up not get stuck in a fissure as it were Just find a clear path and for us to to Go through this Often the distance from a terrible distance such that it echoes at least three times It feels this is gonna be strange thing to say.

[Speaker 1]
It feels like it's echoed three times before it's even steel Is the true cry of a bird of prey?

[Speaker 2]
Horse, okay So we'll just be regular role visit that a table

[Speaker 1]
17 works you find a good place across basically what you do is use the rope to last around an area that looks a Path that looks incomplete but you tug on it with a rope a few times and It's it's a rock solid as far as during the party the party goes head leaps across like a one-foot gap and begins running All right, so next up is a Section of the earth that has a bunch of hands sticking out of it and and We're gonna level to this they're still nature and have a bunch Fine sticking out of them and Manipulating their movements they are attempting to crawl out. What are you folks going to do?

[Speaker 2]
Put my shield in front of me and mow our way through Boulders, I guess And I'm gonna grab one and pull I think we kind of talk about how to pull you into the ground It's a All right.

[Speaker 1]
One course of action is going to be the party's role for this What happens next We're gonna we're gonna do the sensible thing to cross Well, what do you mean to what do you mean to cross Is the thing is these things are covering the ground in front of you We're gonna go with me.

[Speaker 6]
Stop me Shaka's plan.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 4]
He's not go go ahead and roll me to attack Attack roll not a lot of troll. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah

[Speaker 4]
Already do you roll damage or is it just

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I've been your let's see or you're riding your wolf your wolf is going to take about nine damage skeletal hands breaking across it kind of For up the rear it basically takes a takes a breath for a second That's a second win and right as that happens a bunch of skeletal hand So you folks press on you get here a furious wingbeat a moments before a literal How do I put this? There's so much like dust in the air, it's not but it's not bothering your nose not making you sneeze But there's just kind of like this general hazy quality to be nice and humid out Well, these little random blinking bay lights that always seem to wink out as they approach you and you see a wave of Blown up leaves these fade lights Humidity dust water vapor, whatever you want to call it approaching to you with a Tremendous force. I need everybody to make me a strength saving oh Well, yeah, I know better since but come on Okay Robin and talc what are blown backwards into the field of skeletal hands? No Robin will say that you specifically were blown off your Yeah Para I assume avoids this by crawling behind a route that is large enough to hide her Yeah, that's my Jocko The Jocko who is also holding on to a route just kind of like clenching clenching his arms around it like He's front of the force for you.

This is How I Somehow I know it or good somehow. I know this isn't going to end in crowdsurfing It starts in a little bit Okay, you folks are but they don't grab on to you Back up here as you continue running up. You see a small party of centaurs Planking the this section of the tunnel has a bunch of cliffs on the side of it It's still going to a grove or it still maintains the rough grove shape, but they have a few openings to an inward you see Nope, that happens that happens afterwards and you could hear the wind beat is much much closer.

And in fact this a tunnel of Trees stinks a little bit the ceiling sinks a little bit is Allen's rip through it But are not able to but are not able to The head you see centaurs planking on either side that are panicking Have hose drawn and they're looking for something to shoot.

[Speaker 6]
I Would like to roll persuasion to calm them down All righty Maybe get in the tunnel Do I Get any advantage from being like visibly Faye influenced with my antlers I Don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Could I give the aid action?

[Speaker 1]
How are you waiting?

[Speaker 4]
Helping her persuade them How are you doing that just Following along with her and aiding her in her explanation He's trying to keep a looking sturdy and serious and Yes, you speak the other language Do you speak seven?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, I do And can I do a guidance You can do a guy I don't think that no Yes, so Ghanians is gonna work I don't think the aid actions Yeah, I don't have Sylvan.

[Speaker 4]
I only got two other ones in common. Never mind.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think my Help calm them down if you're speaking their own language

[Speaker 1]
Good Is that

[Speaker 6]
Nope, that is with I thought it didn't roll the Way, but it did nice

[Speaker 1]
Yeah All right, so very centaurs like like Climb down into the tunnel itself Neverly escaping a colossal avian beak That folks, you know how I described like there is basically a gap on either side of the tunnel here, that's our Yeah, you see a massive avian beak which is upside down Poke through that Through that opening destroying a small section of the cliff Just and the Centaurs get out of the way basically fine buddy bird shoe It stares at you folks for a moment pulls its head out reeking a little bit more destruction on the cliff And the Centaurs get to running upwards a few of them Carry them on your backs.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 6]
So sure. Yes, please.

[Speaker 2]
There's a little one swimming. I suppose.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah My man keep up All right, so everybody is in the midst of this stampede here there is See here an open section of the tunnel that has been destroyed And you can hear this You hear this hear this rock pooping around you can hear it speeding away Anybody have a means of avoiding an attack from it as you cross?

[Speaker 2]
Would that be like a perception check to see where it's going to attack and just move out of the way Or would them be more like stealth Like they'll be more like stealth.

[Speaker 1]
You can see it's going to be very easy to see where it's attacking I was looking at you. It's coming for you getting out of the way is another matter Okay, I can do a stealth check for me, I'm not sure about anybody else, but Anyway, I can probably I can so whatever you do is basically going to be like you're going to act as party representative Okay, that's happened.

[Speaker 2]
I can cast pass without trace and help us keep people quiet and just like Go over here while the loud ass centaurs take the most attention away from us How's that sound does that work yes now yeah, I was Other input, but no, I work go ahead and roll stuff. Okay, let's pass with that face this And so And it's an edge plus 10 so 34 perfect

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you actually managed to lead even pretty much all the centaurs along a path that helps them move Action by feet and you move it right just the right moment where like it's right immediately after it passes overhead But can't look behind it quite as well and it ends up landing right next to me as a planning right next Other side of the tunnel after you guys have gotten it Next up there is another chasm this one Has fissured the ground lately in front of you About 30 feet across and all the centaurs

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I can miss this step across and I can also vortex warp at least two people across

[Speaker 2]
This isn't having in the centers, unfortunately

[Speaker 6]
Well, if the if the rock focuses on us then the centers can go back into the tunnels and be safe

[Speaker 2]
It's kind of do business

[Speaker 1]
But you guys are in a tunnel, right? Are we yeah, so there was a gap in the tunnel. That was that was the last check that you guys made There's still a Still in the tunnel, there's just a hole I don't suppose that you want to has any spells and create walls or objects or anything like that.

[Speaker 5]
Can I I Mean, I have stone shape, but I don't think that necessarily would make like a bridge that long I Think you said 30 feet 20 to 30 feet Location well, you could stone shape a bridge or a distance.

[Speaker 4]
How far does stone shape do?

[Speaker 5]
It says no more than five feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose So I could take like a five foot by five foot Say oh, it says that the wall has to be less than five feet. So I can't don't think I can just use Stone in general. I think it has to be like a stone object.

[Speaker 6]
That is Yeah, that five foot by five foot If I you if I cast spider climb on one of the centaurs could they ferry us across?

[Speaker 1]
By like walking on the ceiling They could it's going to take time.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah time we don't have I could Twin fly Onto Two centaurs and they could fly us across That would possibly work They'd get us across.

[Speaker 2]
It's less sure whether or not They get the other centaurs across Well, I mentioned if you had two centaurs on one side on the other side of another central they could carry them across So if they took their time, they could get everyone across

[Speaker 7]
I

[Speaker 5]
Could also just teleport us across Because I do have one teleport I can use for that I

[Speaker 1]
Would hope I can teleport like a short distance like that without having them, but somebody's to make a decision on a resource like pronto

[Speaker 5]
That's a teleport Yeah, I will teleport

[Speaker 1]
All right, you teleport across Bringing let's see if there's five technically six of you so you could bring two centaurs across one if they want to Yeah, they'll be with you folks run across and There is a section of the tunnel that has a open canopy where the ears of scraping away as Years of scraping away has revealed it.

There is the skeleton Just barely above ground and like it's mostly submerged within the earth. But the skull is above ground and The light is shining on it When you enter this chamber You get here the swooping get very very close You folks are probably gonna have like less than around or sorry, basically one round to get past the structure How far About 90 feet.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I can't dash that It's a skill challenge try to think of a skill or action I could Work for you and your party Could I tend to?

[Speaker 4]
if the thing When we're on the other side attempt to create a blinding light with daylight To buy us a little more time That was some sort of distraction perhaps yeah Not actually casting the spell.

[Speaker 1]
I'm what yet at least Well, no, they like to commit to it or else it's not going to work Yeah Yeah, I'm willing to do it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm asking the party if they're okay up for it They could work but wouldn't we need to get the Daylight object a little higher. Yeah, but didn't you familiar does it fly?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, my familiar has a fly speed of 40 feet Okay She can also turn invisible. Oh No, you want her to like go up there and try to poke the rocks.

[Speaker 2]
I up No, I was thinking maybe you daylight a stone or something and then fly it up as high as we can And Stop the shiny thing if the Rockets close and then come up and just fly back to us.

[Speaker 3]
So she can fly invisibly And I'm in the roof The roof is open In seconds Okay casting it once we get to the place right right at the exit, um, so I mean she can probably take the dash action and Go 80 feet just straight up towards the rock and invisible Yeah was a glowing super phone Okay Go ahead and be shocker.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me that a either be Jocko or You're familiar. So either be Jocko or Corona and make a spell attack roll.

[Speaker 4]
I'll attack Let's see Cash and see plus your modifier Oh Proficiency plus mod You've got charisma your Five mine would be plus six.

[Speaker 1]
No, wait Jocko what's your proficiency bonus? Oh, okay Okay, unfortunately, it's not going to work but I was a big team mistype policy Oh Okay, that changes that yeah, it does work The day the daylight appears before the rock Very upset and it snaps at snaps at the feature Holding it which is invisible, but it has a pretty good source. Yeah, clearly holding up It's just kind of like it's not like oh, there is a creature holding this right?

It's just kind of like angrily snapping at something. It's buzzing. It's this Does that get us all the way across the the 90-foot gap does but I'm going to It's not kill it doesn't matter Would have been a 27 To hit the familiar.

I assume that Yes Here the familiar dies, but you are able to move on ahead there is a Let's see here there is a fine gate That has a swarming ass of life earth and such that's basically sitting in the center of this gate earth Compost vines leaves Kind of sitting in the center occupying the one free space Anybody can travel through um, you don't have fire Hang on is is it?

[Speaker 6]
Non sentient or is it a shambling mount?

[Speaker 1]
I think shambling mounds are not sentient Is it non animate is this a creature or is this just plants It's a creature.

[Speaker 2]
Oh It's creature.

[Speaker 6]
Oh Do we want to try either nature or persuasion to ask it to shift If you feel we got time go for it I unfortunately, I cannot speak with plants as at this point.

[Speaker 3]
So I can try to speak with it telepathically explain that we're Here to help the lady and kindly ask would it allow us to pass? We mean the rock no harm.

[Speaker 1]
I've got the course of action. What's the what are you folks going with?

[Speaker 2]
That sounds good Uh Have to be intelligent to do that I mean you can try to talk to i'm not sure if that would I know there's intelligent enough for you to speak with I can at least say hello and if it if it responds back then it's intelligent enough, right?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I suppose you could yeah When I make the telepathic connection, does it respond back?

[Speaker 1]
No Okay, uh, and in fact The Three other shamblers drop from the feelings Hitting para corona Each of the three you are going to take 20 damage Ow Lamb at first the next round Before you manage to escape The other shambling mound has come out of its perch between the gate to come attack you guys, but you're able to outrun it

[Speaker 2]
Strong not exactly fast

[Speaker 1]
Wait, you say you're not exactly fast

[Speaker 2]
No, they're not exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I was like what the hell are you telling me? No, it will catch up to me I've never run so fast Already Next up You folks come up congratulations on the nest Yay Do we see the rock anywhere Do not see the rock in your immediate vicinity There was a small clutch of six eggs.

There are various feathers strewn about Um Robin do you want to dash to get a feather?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Yep. I'll do that.

I'll zip on up and Grab a couple of feels like uh, it's presuming I can carry them Depends on how heavy they have I can carry more than one.

[Speaker 1]
I'll do so the other ones that they are like Uh, I don't know which one needs a 40 feet in length Oh, they're very big.

[Speaker 2]
Okay Very big bird That's a big bird. Yeah, uh Well, I do have a doggo that can probably help, uh, maybe But this Have the centaurs follow that's this far still have two other centaurs with you. Yeah, um How long did it take us to get here

[Speaker 1]
Probably about 10 minutes

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I could also do an enhance ability on our strongest, um party member um so that carrying capacity doubles Um, though I think the feathers would still be very unwieldy

[Speaker 2]
I am going to use some rope tied around the feather make a slip knot on that Um so that we can then tie it to a center I guess and then uh, just drag on out of it

[Speaker 4]
Okay If she doesn't handsome billy i'll carry the feather on my back

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we can have like uh one center dragon and like somebody on another center is not this thing tied to it

[Speaker 2]
No, okay.

[Speaker 1]
He just shakes his head

[Speaker 2]
Okay, fine i'll have my I guess I can have my wolf and somebody can carry the phase or something

[Speaker 6]
Um, I can do expeditious retreat and um

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and I have uh get out dodge which can make me and one other person get the f out of here if uh If that rock comes back

[Speaker 1]
But uh, yeah, all right, uh, so if you're going with the wolf Uh have the wolf make the check I guess

[Speaker 5]
And oh wait, hang on I can cast it. Um at one additional Level so that I can target another creature so I could do the wolf and majako Okay Okay Uh the wolf is dragon and uh My jacket is carrying it.

[Speaker 2]
I suppose Two person job.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so and that would be what's advantage.

[Speaker 1]
Okay Uh Oh, come on really Uh, yeah, neither of those Yeah, do it, uh, the wolf doesn't even get the even with majako, let's hear it The wolf starts pulling at this, uh feather Mijako noticing that's not budging at all goes to help. I can't really seem to get a grip on it Uh, you guys have chosen appears to be stuck and the rock swoops down into its nest It is very angry So How far away is the rock from uh majako and the wolf and robin, uh, it's right on top of them Okay, if you have any pretty words to say to this bird to get it to be not mad at us wait Um, can para play one of the bird whistles?

[Speaker 5]
Sure Um, can bird whistles do specific tunes like can she do the tune that um, we've been using?

[Speaker 1]
Uh earlier was that you would that you purchase one in each of the three notes that cardinal recommended You would be able to play each one in succession, okay, she uh, she does that then okay Press the vegetation to to create the tune as well.

[Speaker 4]
Majako also joins in on the tune Um I'll whistle it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So now all right everybody who participated go ahead and make me a performance check

[Speaker 4]
Can I just roll my hand flute tools

[Speaker 2]
All right, so who will

[Speaker 1]
All right, so I think it's gonna be parrot so, uh Parrot the rock is going to turn to you going to run over fly over rather Uh, it's going to attempt to grapple you I think you need to make a dexterity or Athlete either acrobatics or athletics check All right, the rock grabs onto para and prepares to fly over to group Uh, walleria's keep Still here for a round

[Speaker 3]
well, uh Can telco cast a vortex work?

[Speaker 5]
On para to bring her back to the ground Well, if she's turning towards walleria's keep that might be a a good thing question mark Uh, you assume it's not gonna just drop you Yeah, it's presuming they're not just gonna drop some airborne.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but we have the the chicken floss well Hey, if you want to go ahead I'm gonna cast enthrall Can majako use this time to attempt to grab another feather?

[Speaker 2]
I would like to yeah Yeah, i'd like to copy of that Go right ahead Uh, I have my thing. Yeah, you can do that with the vendor. I think hence ability still active, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, then 25 And i'll have my ball Uh, it's going to make a beat and talon attack versus majako Hunts is a past the brawl Is paris still in one talon? No. No you say para Oh, I see.

Okay. All right. Does a 16 hit majako?

[Speaker 4]
No, it does not Take 20 him Can I throw up a shield of faith? After the first attack no

[Speaker 1]
Okay, then it hits I take 26 damage and majako is now ground Oh lovely, uh, but the feather is free and I presume now tied to the

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and if it's strong enough to just run off with that then it'll do so yep, it's uh, you can drag it basically just All right

[Speaker 1]
What's the party doing next yeah

[Speaker 3]
Help was gonna uh cast vortex warp once again this time to grab majako

[Speaker 1]
Perfect that's my second second level skill song Alrighty, so the rest of you Uh, somebody needs to make a check Empty to the situation here That the rock is currently very pissed off and you guys are in best. How would you like to deal with this?

[Speaker 2]
Leave as quickly as possible leave already, uh, does anybody have a check or item to represent you Uh, I can cast darkness And I could cast a spike growth or something to slow him down.

[Speaker 1]
I'll cast web behind us All righty, i'll Man, i'll be running I think it succeeds against But between the spike the spike growth Supposedly Um, yeah, I would imagine the whole house gives everybody cover you're just blinding Uh blinded running through the darkness hoping desperately.

[Speaker 5]
Um, actually everyone has a devil sight. You're right

[Speaker 1]
There's a corona Which is why I use darkness All right, so everybody's able to see through it perfectly you guys run through Perfect Rock just keeps pecking at different areas inside the darkness unawares that you made it into the tunnel Look speed out past the Key passage Trampling mounds again You come across the area that is open You have a little bit of a head start on the rock this time. How would you guys like to get past the? Open roof Is it still focused on the darkness It's not going to be forever And at this point you guys have already if you guys have already run past the shambling mound Uh, it will let's keep running.

I've spent quite a bit of time pecking at nothing going to be on Okay, uh, could you cast darkness again Hmm Uh darkness is only a 15 foot sphere.

[Speaker 5]
It wouldn't get across. Oh, yeah, I can do the daylight thing again Okay, you can cast darkness on an item.

[Speaker 3]
It didn't really work very well the first You can cast it on miyako's sword or robin Weapon or something.

[Speaker 2]
I could shoot an arrow.

[Speaker 5]
It can move with an item.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yeah So delano and i'll just shoot it up into the up through the clearing Yeah, and hopefully it'll Chase after that rather than us Yeah, i'm just hoping to distract it long enough i'll cast it and You shoot it when ready. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
All righty, so you can make an attack roll with advantage

[Speaker 2]
Uh

[Speaker 1]
Perfect you shoot it up into the air you hear the flap you uh, Hired off beforehand And a little bit to the left so it's not directly over Uh, so the arrow will supply directly Huddle and the rock seeing a daylight again five birds to go because I got a Built something last time Uh goes to snap at it And by the time it real mistake you guys already passed the Opening next up is the chasm you guys came across beforehand We got more rope

[Speaker 2]
I don't suppose you can do the teleporting trick again.

[Speaker 5]
Can you I only have one teleport.

[Speaker 3]
Okay Uh, I say we use uh the test fly on the centaurs And try that Wait, don't those feathers we got cast fly upon us Uh, yeah presumably was that fly or was that uncontrolled floating upward True uh fly it is then yeah, my mac can fly this time.

[Speaker 1]
So Okay Yeah, I twin fly and cast it on a centaur It ferries two of you across goes back for the two across You guys are now chasing it Both and it's rider with me Apparently a very long feather behind it Um I'm i'm seeing all of this in my head is looney tunes. This is very much. Oh, yeah All right.

You guys come across another area with uh, well first you come across the spot where Originally meant the centaurs. They're all cheering as you run by them Uh, and I need you folks But before you make it to them That upside down that once again upside down avian head Mashes through the clip this time producing an even larger hole and it stays there waiting to snap at you

[Speaker 2]
Uh, i've got an idea um anyone got um Some lessons or something like that so I can Be some good beers and we just just hurl that into its mouth

[Speaker 5]
I have some fresh honey.

[Speaker 2]
I have good berry Yeah, I've got regular berries I think we could just give it a nice little package and just throw it into his mouth.

[Speaker 4]
So it has something to chew on while we Run by I'm just anyone else got any other plans i'm going to help you out with the create food and water How long does that last take never mind can't cast that I thought it was second level not third.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, never mind all right, uh Oh, let's cast good beer then and uh Tied to a lesson who wants to hurl it in there? I'll toss it in Yeah Just Football spike that thing.

[Speaker 1]
All right, i'm gonna skip past this. Uh, this is not going to work as you guys go Awesome stuff into its open mouth. Uh, it does open its mouth.

Uh, and then I take well

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's more like thinking getting a package and just throwing it and his mouth has opened it up

[Speaker 4]
That's basically what I was thinking

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if your characters are like professional baseball players or whatever but

[Speaker 4]
uh

[Speaker 1]
I said so this is like as you guys are running you're carried Uh more or less into its range of threat or influences when this happens

[Speaker 7]
Um

[Speaker 1]
My assumption is this is happening when it is able to bite it

[Speaker 2]
Okay Okay

[Speaker 6]
I don't think speak with animals would really help

[Speaker 2]
No No, I doubt it

[Speaker 6]
And I don't think we should fight it

[Speaker 2]
Especially since it's a palace this lady's healing bird

[Speaker 1]
All right, so alcoa and Corona are going to take really 20 damage.

[Speaker 3]
Uh Helco is going to use his reaction and cast silvery barbs And he's going to give advantage to the jocko on future attempts All right, so you guys just going to take that 20 damage Um, okay It was a shot Yeah, you got some advantage out i'm at 19 what's up next i'd like to quickly He suggests we Do something to heal ourselves on the way Yeah uh, I think we have a Six people in the party, right?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, everyone gets 17 Thank you Love you Yeah, well I think there's five of us but it includes the uh mountain and yeah Um, you guys are healing yourselves up in the midst of this I need somebody to make another check Okay Four You guys have not gotten past this thing yet Oh, uh, we saw okay. We're still in the tunnel. Are we was this thing snapping us?

[Speaker 5]
Okay, we could faint it or not not faint it is faint the right turn Yeah, basically like pretend to go one way and like go a different one um I could try and poison spray it and then pin in the eyes I I cast minor illusion to see if I can distract it long enough to slip past.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let's see It's gonna be uh A a centaur Actually, you know what no, it's I think this is just gonna work It's a beast. Okay, so You send a centaur running off in the other direction, uh, basically straight towards it Uh, the others the centaurs the real centaurs on the other side Of a of this thing who are like sure you guys go on they look kind of confused for a moment And they see the rock Bite into this thing and they all like have a cry of like horror like no All in unison before they notice that the before they notice the illusion didn't fade Uh and again, uh profoundly confused Uh as is the rock but you guys are ahead of it and the centaurs join you for the ride

[Speaker 3]
do we still have the the Ramblers or Forget what they called in front of us The thorny reek things or we're past those guys The shambling mounds.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're past those Yeah, we're past that we're doubling back I think coming up on the skeleton hands, yeah, I think we're on the hands Next I think How about a fireball on the hands?

[Speaker 1]
If you can do so wait for her jam to come back i'm here, can you say that um

[Speaker 3]
Uh When we get to the When we get to the skeletal hands i'm going to cast fireball into the midst of the skeletal hands

[Speaker 2]
All right, then it'll work perfectly

[Speaker 1]
Uh, all the hands go back under the earth, uh, some of them having actually been destroyed some of them just not like being burnt Uh or rather lines attached to them don't and you folks, uh pass without issue and Make it back to the Uh, make it back to the guardsman All right, he clicks his Silver pocket watch. Ah, very nice 43 seconds.

There we go right on Time does work differently here

[Speaker 7]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you make it back the guardsman is going to take you folks to your Um Customs going to take you folks back to whatchamacallit

[Speaker 7]
Okay

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sorry

[Speaker 7]
Yeah

[Speaker 1]
Uh, take you back to valeria trailing this massive feather behind you She very weakly stands up But is uh has smiled for the first time Saw her

[Speaker 3]
So mizaka has the honor of oh no, uh robin's wolf is carrying the feather

[Speaker 2]
Yeah

[Speaker 4]
I'm, just carrying the tail part of the feather

[Speaker 2]
And keep it from digging on the ground. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah Yeah I bet the wolf is doing that like ridiculous proud dog prancy walk If you want to say yeah Absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
What's the dog's uh fly speed up? Uh 40 feet 40 feet, okay Uh when leary is going to approach again, we had a stumbling her cardinal is with her time Helps her walk over As she approaches the rock feather gets color color color Please sit down there would have made it like a lot easier And uh until it's small enough to just pick up in the palm of her and she Attaches it to a set of feathers, right? color is like literally Just kind of flows back into her she's Most saturated thing that you see in this room or indeed have seen all day You're just saying quite a bit because everything in the world is over saturated with color

[Speaker 6]
I was kind of expecting her to eat it

[Speaker 1]
It was I uh, so Oh This is I remain It's a spot and a bit silent I did not give you Adventures proper welcome abode

[Speaker 2]
What might I call you? Does our organization even have a name?

[Speaker 6]
No Attention We operate out of sears cape we could be sears knights You may call me majako my lady As I do a partial bow Where's knights in me?

[Speaker 1]
first of all Cardinal have not grown You my lady have not grown any salt disappointment Perhaps we should So miserable Yes, yes after dinner she turns to the group Nope First I'd like to No, no cardinal has told me it if there are any details Share with so Uh, I was out On patrol Start my pallet Progressively As a incentive and supply even the Places in which the cross has been eaten back as a thing to ease pain in the cross, uh Long I For me Cloud Led me No contraptions, but I couldn't find my way out Sorry, but unless I cried out there they appeared to me said Let me out if I Enquished my voice It's hard a choice Um Self-feeling rather assured

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you're cutting in and out pretty bad at least for me i'm picking up every single oh god guys

[Speaker 1]
Tell me when that's happening, please

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah, it only started happening in that last little bit

[Speaker 1]
Oh the last yeah. Okay. What did you guys hear last?

[Speaker 5]
Um, she lost her voice and she thought she'd be deposited somewhere and that's kind of the last bit that I got

[Speaker 1]
Okay, she's deposited back at her keep But she was the Deposited back at her keep And go the maze maker was pretty sure that yeah, i'm just trying to rethink of where my point what was I getting So she was deposited back at her keep The viasra was probably pretty sure that she wasn't going to return to the fight But the maze maker was certain that she was her fight And He believes That her voice has been sent off with Some military commander. So one of the seven armies that safane command likely has control of her voice Oh lovely We're gonna have to recover that Ideally before the battle Whether it's her voice, uh Give the commander power to the to command her her maze or no, not the command It's likely I I wouldn't assume that it's just a Who knows what their infernal maze maker?

The point is that you will certainly find out should you bring it to bear against you Fantastic The cardinal says I think I would suspect something that pierces your ears perhaps controls you by Hearing this finely soft voice Sound like a siren song perhaps Or it could just be a weapon shrill enough to make your head explode Which also sounds bad.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm Do you know of any way that we could track? your voice And find it before they can use them She breathes into her.

[Speaker 1]
She's like well now that I have my voice back She plucks a few feathers from her own body Cups them in her hand and breathes into them And three blue jays fly outwards along with one cardinal To flit around the party Because these will guide you For whoever holds it

[Speaker 7]
Sounds like we have more work to do Awesome indeed

[Speaker 1]
To all the fuck but in the meantime if there are any boons I can offer you or assistance Be happy too

[Speaker 5]
Have you heard about salile

[Speaker 1]
I have heard of a new consort or would be queen or perhaps a new hunter And she kind of spits out that last word It says yes, I don't know What to think of this, but I suppose any port in the store At the very least there will be I will be perfectly happy Seeing rosa marina upset that a new ad has entered Someone else to win over banassa's affection Speaking of banassas, where is he? Before mentioned rose has been asking after uh, he's also at her spire She's not going to fight this one be it we kicked his butt Oh Pleasant day you deserve it and I took his butt

[Speaker 6]
And his it's almost gonna say roller skates high skates Oh my god, say on roller skates

[Speaker 1]
They're all wearing seventies clothes wind jackets Oakley oakley's or ray-bans depending on how old they are

[Speaker 6]
Yeah

[Speaker 2]
And they're colored sunglasses

[Speaker 6]
I was thinking like 1990s bright neon nylon

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah

[Speaker 3]
I'm picturing i'm picturing mizako's goliath on roller skates with 70 shorts on

[Speaker 5]
I warn you. I am an artist.

[Speaker 1]
This is a threat Yeah Wow She says well, he's not much of a hunter. Anyways, i'll have you know, i've eaten three times I don't even call myself. I just call myself a guy and then I didn't find him to be much of a challenge at all Inevitably But of course All right.

So you guys want to close out the session here? Sounds good to me After we get back to the overworld. Oh, yes Are you guys going back to the overworld?

[Speaker 2]
I I guess it kind of depends on the blue jay slash cardinal On whether or not this individual that we're looking for is in the road or in the overworld

[Speaker 1]
They are in fact in the road, but they are leaving soon

[Speaker 2]
so

[Speaker 3]
They probably want to catch them in the road before

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Because time and distance is timey-wimey in this place so we might be able to catch them before they leave

[Speaker 4]
That and we only had a couple weeks to

[Speaker 2]
Actually, uh get everything solved yeah As soon as we get back to the overworld things are gonna get we might just lose track of them So we might want to catch them before they leave

[Speaker 6]
um Could we do a session like tomorrow night Because I can't Stay up for ages longer

[Speaker 1]
I wouldn't mind doing a session. Yeah, so, uh, I don't know if you caught it earlier, but it while you're in the road Uh time doesn't pass for your character Yep, so we will come back at exactly this moment most likely all right That that sounds good Yeah, but also I can play tomorrow night.

[Speaker 2]
So You said you can or can't I can Okay I don't think i'm available tomorrow tomorrow evening.

[Speaker 1]
It depends how late it would be I should be available If we do it in part two, otherwise next week is all Oh, yeah, and there will of course be there are there's one final thing At least as far as valerius Once you get her voice Feels like I don't know Yeah Sounds good to me. Oh, yeah All right. Well, well done with the skill challenge.

I always get nervous when I bust that out It's an artifact of fourth edition.

[Speaker 4]
So I've been nervous that out I love that artifact though from fourth edition.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it certainly would have been Like grid based cop. All right, go ahead

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I mean it breaks up combat because I mean it's great and all but it does get a little monotonous if that's all you're ever doing So and this gives you something else to do so Especially if you know, you want to allude to combat but not necessarily actually heaven Or conflict without combat

[Speaker 1]
All right Uh, well i'm going to be on probably for about a another half hour if folks have questions or want to discuss anything Uh, in fact, I guess but other than that, I let's see if the xp for tonight is Here you did not harm the rock which offers you a little bit of speed you did of course Mr all of you area You, uh did not end up fighting the centaurs or getting any of them killed which is good

[Speaker 3]
And we we let them fly that should be worth something I don't know what that was.

[Speaker 1]
I thought it was spectacular So you guys did make I think i'm going to give you guys about 3 000 xp apiece Yay Uh, and for those of you who are getting off now have a fantastic evening, thanks for playing with Uh, we don't have to worry about downtime activities since we're staying in the world, right? Yes, that's the one disband.

[Speaker 2]
All right now i'm gonna go What's well it's an advantage for me because I don't know the downtime activity rules yet so I can put it off a little longer But wait what time I'm gonna log on tomorrow as soon as I can Um, what time would work for you, um compared to like now Like what time is it now for you?

[Speaker 3]
Uh right now it's only like It's only 9 p.m for me right now.

[Speaker 5]
Oh you're uh, you're on the same time zone as I am That's a pst actually Oh pacific Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah west coast Oh That is um Yeah, no i'm on the other side of the world so it's like four o'clock in the afternoon for me I'm, just an insomniac. I don't do mornings very well so um, so 7 30 ish tomorrow Uh, when do you normally start? Um, this game started at five for me Okay, so for me Okay, if we're starting around the same time, that's fine You know because that's what I put in the session times Oh, yeah I probably would be just an hour late But so I I think that would be okay.

[Speaker 3]
I could probably oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
So you're having trouble coming in earlier not later. Yeah Okay later is better for me um I just don't know about everybody else. I can stay up as long as you need to me too Because you know, it's a day for me.

So Yep, you know, it's just going earlier is more difficult. But if we're starting later than that's easy I get to have more sleep.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah Uh, so do we want to start like maybe an hour later?

[Speaker 2]
I think that's okay with everyone else. Yeah. Yeah, that would that would be good

[Speaker 5]
All right Uh, that sounded like you had a butt i'm not sure on the others, uh, the the others aren't here

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well, I wouldn't mind doing an hour later

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we just have a chicken with jam

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I think the only person who's not here is um

[Speaker 3]
Bar yeah

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so, um whenever she sees that maybe she can uh put a uh opinion on that

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we'll tentatively have it as an hour later than that And

[Speaker 5]
See it didn't sound like she was gonna have too much issue with um time she did say That time there that day would work Um, I just don't know what time zone she's in so I don't know How like detrimental?

[Speaker 4]
One hour later would be And i'm going to have to call it a night for myself Yeah You have a good night Will do Try and enjoy the load I will curse majako soon. I'm already working on poses Well, i'll be joining you tomorrow I just got some running around to do later this Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no, I mean i'm drawing majako in in that 80s style roller skate because it's not going to leave my mind and I know it Uh majako and a goliath, so why not do bruce or?

[Speaker 4]
dual in it They're actual goliaths What is majako? Very tall very human so you can have liberty with whatever you want to draw not that one but yeah Make sure to post the art in the art design thingy Hopefully it doesn't yell at me for having too much skin tone He probably could use a little more skin tone And I could laugh I'll stick around to update james I don't know I'll catch rivers next weekend.

[Speaker 2]
I'll try whatever.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Hey everybody

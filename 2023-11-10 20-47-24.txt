[Speaker 4]
Then then Vix might be it.

[Speaker 1]
Otherwise Rana can do blight Morgan what's attacking us?

[Speaker 2]
Can I make another perception check?

[Speaker 3]
By two okay, so there's very scant light sources out across the out across the At at night that are gonna help you when you're looking for something moving at this speed and stuff like that and that's broadly keeping to the shadows, especially of the Points attacking from the direction of the rough direction of the mountains It's kind of staying in the mountains shadow, but you guys are still out of it so when you see it move out of out of said mountain shadow, you're able to see a One large winged creature and Several smaller ones following close behind it The largest can't really make out the smaller ones But the largest ones the largest one definitely looks draconic the smaller ones look a little bit more bird-like

[Speaker 2]
Big draconic some way and a lot of little followers

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna cast Enhanceability for Constitution on Rana So you get to d6 temporary hit points And advantage on constitution checks for an hour

[Speaker 1]
That's really good Thank you

[Speaker 4]
Or until I lose concentration

[Speaker 2]
alrighty

[Speaker 1]
Everybody ready for initiative. I think so.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Let's start off with the begin.

[Speaker 1]
No Fuck did it roll a three?

[Speaker 3]
Does have any dexterity bonus Impressive, it's got a save but not nothing but

[Speaker 1]
For combat, I would like to activate my animated shield if that's okay

[Speaker 2]
I'll use my vanguard ability to go into um Go into combat a wild shape higher Nice Just trying to do the finalize nah, not a bear No, no bears higher up than like challenge reading to unfortunately

[Speaker 1]
Travesty I was a little bit worried there was um, what was their name epic gamer? I really didn't want to play with them today.

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
No, I have self-control now. Thank you very much Seeing them join their names epic gamer their icons dragon ball So funny they were just so keen to run a session like I respect it Do you even know the roles of the server buddy? You know the rules of the game?

[Speaker 3]
This we will find out That's why I'm gonna have to make the character first if they don't know if they mess up anything I think I'm just gonna kick them. So no explanation.

[Speaker 2]
No You guys watch the front of the boat Why do you think I was asking about capacity, yeah, okay now I get it I was Capacity so if this fucks up, it's not Morgan's fault really channeling the Beatles if I am All righty Sensors Doc really out to 60. All right, and can we get Z on on the on the yeah, I haven't Combat tracker there. I know We're getting attacked there's violence happening, there's a draconic short arm shape and Send Morgan to the naughty boy corner All right, so we're ready to begin we're gonna start with Kyrona Just for reference part of the grave runner has to be within 30 feet.

[Speaker 1]
So I'll tell you when she's going to do it.

[Speaker 4]
All right, I have So many things I have to hold in my head right now so holding an action I'm gonna hold my action until Fix goes. Can I do that? Yes, you can All right, and I'm going to hold that action specifically to cast Eldritch blast this is fun to me.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah that perks within the rules All right, carry on All right Yeah, um, I guess she'll just fire her operators Chris. Yes. I was forgetting whether it was you or Sierra that had that Maya has it.

She's a rogue Um She'll spend her bonus action to steady aim Giving her advantage. She cannot move this time She will then I declare how many bolts she'll she'll send five bolts at it. Oh Is that a scout feature or just like a rogue feature?

Oh, that's a that's an optional rogue feature. I think they added that in Tasha's So fucking good. It's a such a good weapon for it Yes Advantage That looks weird Does an 18 hit?

18 just hits So the damage I declared are five extra bolts so that would be an extra 4d6 Plus sneak attack which is 2d6 That is an extra 6d6 Do damage types matter for this? It's magical piercing. It's all magical piercing.

It does exactly so you don't have to worry about it that Module if you got is this?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's the quality of life module Is that mini? Oh, yeah a midi Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I haven't used it before but it seems good.

[Speaker 3]
I Might turn it back off. It depends on whether or not I could I remember causing us some problems with some Spells earlier.

[Speaker 1]
I see what this one does, but I futzed around with it a little bit turned off some of the automation The I think I've asked you this before but the volley crossbow is auto loading It loads one at the start of its turn. I think is that how that works? Mm-hmm Okay So it would go back to 16 bolts, whoops, I didn't mean to ping that twice.

Oh, that's Maya's turn. Sorry All right It's gonna bring us to Ziana Yana is 90 feet away from the shadow dragon It is a red shadow dragon Yeah Yeah, I was talking to you earlier Hello I'm guessing you guys already fought the drag. We're oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
We're in a game right now I was gonna meet you for a sec Alrighty, all right, go ahead Ziana Yep Boom hex and outage blast Yeah easy Yeah, Ziana is going to hex and then outage blast Range on hex, is it 90?

[Speaker 1]
Bam. It is 90 hot dog Perfectly positioned Oh My god, I'm so blind.

[Speaker 2]
I don't play Characters that cost spells. All right, so how many being a druid. It's a druid that's a bear I'm just a bear man As the attack is a 16 hit a 16 unfortunately misses 18 Second beam 24 it's easy No, I can tap that later.

[Speaker 3]
So there's eight force and For necrotic All right, it is god fucking damn it dude, holy shit, sorry Kept barging me is a Fading did like six times in a row. It's so fucking distracting. Oh my god, anyways And he said it's resistance of the necrotic damage so that's gonna be So we're looking at minus 10 Cool all right Ziana you got anything else for your turn?

That's it. All right Brings us to Bix and Kyrona All right.

[Speaker 4]
I have to pull up my sneak attack bonus because I can never remember it Level 8 846 all right, so fix is gonna go first How does fix not have anything ranged I think Yeah Kyrona has a spare longbow That he that they can borrow Give me one minute. I should have done this before but I didn't realize if he Don't look at my shame Okay longbow I Can Kyrona what's going on? I'm trying to get this damn crossbow to fire Longbow to fire but it's yelling at me about ammunition Okay No, I got it, I think I hope got it Really that doesn't hit all right Sorry Bix all right.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna say module settings. It's gonna reload the application. Is it not doing that again?

God fucking damn it MIDI just let people roll the goddamn No, it's so convenient that tracks your ammo for you.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sure this will make it easier for you It's okay if it tracks my ammo provided.

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't keep me from rolling my goddamn damage Holy shit anyways All right.

[Speaker 4]
So Bix misses but Kyrona has been holding her action to fire Seriously, all right.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, that doesn't know that doesn't seem right at all. No that adds up No, definitely not. So you have a proficiency bonus of plus four and it's supposed to make a spell attack roll All right, maybe something's wrong with the bow in my inventory then because probably based off your day Yeah, it's definitely it's basically off your dexterity bonus.

It's not including the plus three bonus. Oh, that's right I remember so that should be like He was rolling for that should be like it's more like that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah All right So To be I Don't remember if I roll separately for each beam.

[Speaker 3]
It's been forever since I played no worries It's been a few months. All right, both those hit And then extra six on top of those so we're looking at Cool all right, is that Kyrona sir?

[Speaker 4]
Um The damage from favored foe only comes after I mark it, that's correct Okay That's fine however It is now Blinded until the end of its next turn.

[Speaker 3]
Give me a second. I have to kick somebody nice All right now blind until the end of its turn Mm-hmm. All righty.

[Speaker 1]
How much of a kick was that? Oh, thank you Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 3]
You guys here. I have OBS on so it doesn't could be a notification when somebody leaves for trip No, they just tagged me like hey, does this work All right done.

[Speaker 2]
All right All right, so it's gonna bring us to Morgan Morgan currently Isn't doing shit as The thing isn't here yet. Oh He could have acted no, he would have yeah, he would have rolled out his totem. Okay All right, let me just ping it on my thing No, take her on his turn if that's okay, she's just going to toll the dead that's fine Vic if it could take a wisdom save All right.

Boom That is Morgan's turn Makes it charts. Okay The bear will move to there so that the weight isn't all over the place I guess that I guess the walrus will flop like a little bit further back so that are it's Hopefully comes straight at me That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not gonna bother raging until it gets to me Actually, Rana will use a bonus action to cost shield of faith That's around his turn is done as well Which brings us to the dragon It's dragon time It's sorry.

[Speaker 3]
I didn't hear it. Was that all for Rana's turn?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, she's done. She used all the dead and then shield of faith.

[Speaker 3]
It is now it's turn Yeah, boy Oh Oh, yeah, oh definitely what size is that cone Pretty foot cone. Oh, it's not really a big cone. It's pop it, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's gonna start off with the the biggest thing on the board here fuck Maya loves dex saves I think Do you see 18 dexterity saving throw? Oh, man, that doesn't go anywhere That's a cool aura it is My it takes no damage. That's it's a deck save.

All right, but I do need the walrus to make it I'm good.

[Speaker 2]
So well Just the good All righty exactly average All right, so you take 20 Dammit I should have raged and think it attack me Were you holding your action by the way? No, I use my action to summon this bear.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Okay Maya does a backflip I find the war sucks Walrus is gonna get up attack of opportunity as it moves over to Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Okay It's tusks time, baby Here is an attack Reckless. Whoa, I don't know that it's rolling.

[Speaker 3]
I guess you get the crit.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I Won't let me do it roll again 17 not easy Here is the damage BAM 18. Oh, damn And it's big awesome resistant to non-magical damage Excellent I think my wild shape counts as Anyways, yeah. Oh, although let's let me scooch the walrus down so I can look at Morgan's character sheet That is that is that is something good to know primal strike yet is Yep, they are magical.

So it doesn't matter.

[Speaker 3]
There you go. Now you could drive Morgan over your thing. He'll always be in the Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you've got Morgan on top. Thank you. I'm just gonna move him down in the corner then So he's not over its face.

So he's not in the fucking walrus's mouth That is that is his reaction done there What's it doing to the runner?

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't have any at the moment.

[Speaker 4]
It's just sitting there menacingly Raises to the top of the round though with Kairona This time I'm gonna hold my action until after it goes So I'm willingly putting myself at the bottom of initiative Yeah, that's okay.

[Speaker 3]
If you want I could reset your initiatives to like the bot if you want to like change your yeah Yeah, and just consider it me holding my action every time because I'm gonna keep this thing blind as fuck That's why we got to go back to group initiative just by side everybody goes at once. All right That's gonna make us go to Maya instead Maya will fire.

[Speaker 1]
She'll steady aim again and Fire the crossbow five bolts easy peasy I Shouldn't being a monk and said using a crossbow not punching things I Really wanted to play a monk clearly steady aim gives advantage. I didn't roll with advantage It's probably not gonna do it because I turned off MIDI so it's probably not gonna There we go, so that's that's a hit damage is sneak attack plus an extra 66 That is all magical piercing now that is Maya's turn done easy fast fuck boy brings us to Xiana Oh Scorching radars lost.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
All right Oh, wait a second, it's a it's a Red shadow dragon you can see like this hint of red.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's a red shadow dragon not scorching You have gutting bolt, don't you? Oh, wow All right, we'll start with that we'll start with the Eldritch Blast Alrighty Eldritch Blast Attack bam a miss Two misses, all right What level guiding oh, it's a pact magic one. Never mind.

It's always second So she could choose to do either other guiding either to use a pact magic or a spell Yeah Okay, sick, uh, is that only no it is 120 cool cool. All right blame 21 11 radiant and For necrotic hex damage, I have the two And yep, and now the next person to smack it has advantage Very good from the guiding bolt To get on the flying carpet Would that be an action or something? Oh, you could totally pull that out now if you wanted to okay done easy You are on the carpet I'm gonna put you it like Five yeah, five foot elevation to is our airship stationary No, it is moving right now How high up can the carpet go before losing the inertia of the airship?

[Speaker 1]
Sit So how far actually how fast is the thingy moving forward to the airship 60 feet 60 feet now the carpets faster than that Yeah That's so many less fireball I Need to do the Baldur's Gate Guardian of Faith or whatever and is in Everything just a wand is in to die.

[Speaker 3]
I did a cloud of Sturges once I was like, there's a thousand Sturges What are you guys gonna do?

[Speaker 4]
I Fuckin Dennis All right, is that the honest term yeah fix Fix is going to bonus action dash Is that too close for the longbow There's no too close Okay, unless you're within five feet of it and so you're good I mean, okay Very good And that's a sneak attack so That is it for Thanks, yep Awesome awesome And just to Morgan next and I am going to I'll see that's a way better.

[Speaker 2]
Nice Stick it up with the walrus will flop over and strike at the dragon Recklessly Recklessly Advantage 19 that hits BAM 17 bludgeoning and then as part of my multi attack. I also tusks it. Oh, what am I doing?

Oh Classic does a 16 hit 16 Unfortunately does not hit and then you know in classics in classic fashion Everyone who's played Baldur's Gate has done this before. I will then rage Whoopsie that's a whoopsie. That's okay.

All right. It was tactical. Trust me.

That is the end of my turn All right. Oh Sorry, my bear. I will command my bear to move to Yeah Yeah, those are it's two attacks body flop and tusks awesome and It can hold its breath for 30 minutes and it apparently has dark vision.

I don't know where it got that but it has The ocean I'm guessing I suppose I don't know how good walrus as I said are and I'm gonna be honest I'm probably not gonna check All right, that's good Rana will cast bestow curse.

[Speaker 1]
She'll use the Well curse the target must make a wisdom saving throughout the start of each of its turns if it fails it waits the section doing nothing that turn So it must make a wisdom save now or be cursed It is automatically upcast to fourth level because of the book of exalted deeds or loss of ten minutes Fails it is cursed Which then brings it to its turn which that drops shield of faith Incredible use my resources, but anyway Go on you're fucking the eighth level you have nothing but resources Now it's its turn. It gets to make the wisdom save again to see if it wastes its turn It wastes its action that turn sorry, you can still move or if it has bonus action Rana's just swinging one of her bells and a figure eight above her head.

[Speaker 3]
She holds her shield to its face Now that brings us to Kairona one of the These fellas gonna do anything Their turn was basically moving Okay That's a dash action Kairona I heard you Wait, let me take the deepest breaths Plus an extra three for each of those And I get a thing for favored Yep d6 All right, well the 27 hit points that is Below its max. How would you like to do this?

[Speaker 4]
um just one Gorgeously arcing eldritch blast over the walrus into the eye socket

[Speaker 3]
very good you watch a Twisting little I let's see here You watch two beams come into one twist together and just drill down the center mass After puncturing the head itself just kind of like goes straight through and then through again and This thing dissipates into shadow leaving behind a symbol

[Speaker 4]
That's disappointing a face

[Speaker 3]
with no eyes No real facial features except where the eyes are supposed to be I'm sort of wearing a mask Where the eyes are supposed to be there are staghorns coming out. Sorry bastard ain't everybody Who can see this to go ahead and make me a wisdom saving throw Man so many of my things I see it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty far back If you could see where that you know, what hell yeah this walrus rolls cracked or whatever Okay, never never worried about a thing Never needed to I rolled a nine what happened? All right, Maya and Bix Actually, I'm gonna drag you to into the other channel for a moment Oh Bye don't die alone So long.

[Speaker 3]
All right, you two have been exposed to rescue symbol Which is currently the green god symbol as well Bring god of war to him It's not you're not going to be dominated per se But certain thing when certain things come up when you come across a ritual site Just you can just tuck this Back in your memory here when you come across a ritual site, you will have the instinct or you will have the urge To complete it in Therese's favor and dedicate it to her And you may also have certain urges to dedicate other other actions to Therese Like if you come across a trying to the green god of war to me

[Speaker 1]
We aware which Say again, are we aware? This is is this a charm?

It feels like a charm It's a little bit of a charm. Yeah Are we aware that we're under the influence if you're so if you're looking you have a feature that can maybe work against Stillness of mind so you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened Yeah, like this is like a curse Okay, if it's a curse that I'm fucked. I Had to try this stillness of mind never gets to be used.

[Speaker 3]
No, that's right Okay, so if you had if you had Jesse up here and you would use counter charm that totally would work Thanks Jesse It's it's weird because like this is definitely supposed to be like this long-term effect and if it slots under curse At least of the way I've been working on it now, but I don't know how to handle Like ending it ending a condition. I feel like that would be Okay, here's here's an idea that I have if you have someone in your party who can end charms Here's how the curse is gonna work it's gonna activate the charmed condition at these specific moments It's like a like a program delusion or like a glyph of warning where it goes off of it on the set time We're under the set conditions So if you have somebody there and counter charm

[Speaker 1]
They would about um about minstrel dice. I think they can affect charm saves Uh Minstrel dice can be used to increase or decrease any check or saving throw made to cause or avoid being charmed But that's is that applicable here? I'm so fucking split on this It's okay.

If it's not I I'm just I'm exhausting off my option. No, that's totally reasonable I feel I feel like the curse is gonna override that or like it's not it's applying a curse Standard charm, it's a curse that inflicts a charmed like effect. Yeah Okay, would remove curse work then?

[Speaker 3]
so remove curse could work, but it wouldn't go under the curse rules for the That we include in the encounter manual Meanwhile Bix who is a Fae is just like I guess I worship Theresia now.

[Speaker 1]
Cool I Think if a you probably would have had advantage on the save. I think that's a typical Maybe that's just for phasing friends.

[Speaker 3]
I think they have advantage on saves against being charmed But that's the thing that we just went through a moment ago is technically this is versus being Yes I just accidentally closed the game. That's okay You can bring it back up All right, so we're gonna go back there We're gonna take a break for like 10-15 minutes and then you guys are going to a dragon cave It gets oh, yes All right, so we'll be right back Everything is perfectly fine I'm glad to hear that.

[Speaker 2]
Everything's fine. Yeah, I'm not kill you in your sleep Try You Can stab Morgan in the neck while he's sleeping and he probably Say that to an assassin rogue my dude, you can do it. You can try you can try Does anyone hear you're not killing?

[Speaker 1]
It's Morgan Okay, so as the harpies are going to begin scattering I'm just gonna go elsewhere oh hell yeah No, you have to tell them if we want their XP You force them to flee We're getting I just want making clear we're getting maximum XP this session no running away none of that crap We're killing everything and getting all The 25 XP a piece.

[Speaker 2]
So what you're All of it We're gonna double dip all of it too because we're gonna beat the combat encounter without using combat and then kill them anyway So we get the XP twice I love watch What did I Well, what was it? No, it was it was Eve playing Baldur's Gate It was the the mechanical is the robot guy at the top of the tower She like hit all the prompts properly and like got all the XP It's like wow easy and then it's like yeah, I'm gonna fight it on his XP just killed him Anyway, and got even more XP Beautiful Let's see here.

[Speaker 3]
All right, that's funny. I Looked over I'm like, I don't remember so my session XP counter journal, there's a mark for We're gonna take a break for 15 minutes, by the way So I can stand up to the thing, but I looked at my XP counter journal. I looked in the The session, all right, so I guess the one year the one-year anniversary was three days ago Well as I saw 11 722 but I thought said 23 I'm like I didn't I didn't make a mark like three days ago and that I I was like, wait, you know 22.

Oh Today travel mole combat wreath-born wrecks plus a frost roll I love that wreath-born wrecks.

[Speaker 1]
The arrow shows up the end with white horses like in the Princess Bride At what point of our travel did this happen? This would have been on the very last day Which green Just saw your tweet Meaning grab a drink. I'll be back.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna go acquire some Okay Hello guys, it's epic gamer here here to annoy James That's what my the good place would be People with OC track I would just be forcing someone to be on Twitter for like a year straight and the only other people on Twitter are people with Like Aramonga sensei fucking icons God, I wouldn't lie.

[Speaker 2]
I'd be I'd Fuckin find me.

[Speaker 1]
I remember some say because of the Australian island The town of Queensland in Queensland, yes Ah I'm not a degenerate. I promise Just sure What are they Rings of What was I looking for? Ah, yes none of your business I Need to ask James I'm seeing a bunch of harpies rolling d9s.

It's very cool. Maybe the harpies are getting lost I sure hope so Caleb I really liked last week at Steve's where They were stuck with the stupid door puzzle for ages and then you rubbed two brain cells together Solved it.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't want to rub two brain cells together. I was tired So I had to do with the Fucking I did enjoy Steve's new character Yeah, I like the worst things about it of the Steve elements, but that's okay It's like we get it you had like a pixie folk fuck a storm giant that was funny Maybe like the for like half of the first time you said it, but the third time it's done aware on me Steve Yeah, I like I like the idea but he kept reiterating it it's like do you get it did nobody But do you get it never do you dig and I'm like man I need to Well, I just close my eyes roll fucking Lean back in the chair and up the fall kills me.

[Speaker 1]
Oh Goodness I got a nice chicken sandwich here and some eggnog mix of bourbon.

[Speaker 3]
I Minds well, then I like eggnog but mixed with alcohol. It's usually good and in a glass that I've Left in the freezer for about an hour. Oh Hell, yeah All right.

There we go. I found the thing I was looking for Hmm. How are you folks doing right now?

[Speaker 2]
Pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Ready to rumble Cookies real quick children James you mentioned Countering Specific effects, where would I find that in the Chalmers Valley rule? Yeah, I think you said the encounter and you all did you see the exploration?

[Speaker 3]
Don't go to the encounter manual now Thrasios is not on there, but You will see what I mean when you look at curses which should follow it should immediately follow diseases That's before does nope you are correct Is what we had to do to make curses stick was we had to figure out a Way to because remove curse says you just get rid of it Yeah, I don't like that It's fucking retarded. So now I have to put in every single curse Any attempt to remove this with a spell or similar method requires it you could either Observe it which is trying to dispel it with a remove curse or something like that.

[Speaker 1]
And Then there's removal which is something like Which is something like trying to fulfill the conditions of the curse Right, I see How oh, I guess I can guess what would know that one actually so I'm not gonna ask For Remove curse hypothetically hypothetic Is that similar to the spell magic where I? Think the cell magic.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe it's counter spell words and plus Oh, that's it is both counter spell and a spell magic and I believe that remove curse is not The the will 5e's version of a counteract check right like your role, right? Yeah So removing us just removes it exactly.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah What we're looking at right now is that my curses in the encounter manual all basically do the dispel magic thing where you roll? And you would add your ability modifier Yes, unless of course you're an abjuration wizard.

[Speaker 1]
I Would be handy, but I am NOT So for example The book of exalted deeds Rana up costs every spell by one level would costing remove curse at a higher level benefit this check

[Speaker 2]
I do not believe so if it works like the spell magic it makes the minimum easier So if you cost obviously there's a difference if someone's casting a fourth level spell between a third and a fourth level counter spell, right? But if you're costing a ninth level counter spell literally doesn't matter what spell they cost Like it's it's all the same Exactly.

If you're casting a seven anything different and if you're casting a third level counter spell There's no difference between using a fourth or a ninth on it. They're the same spell. Mm-hmm Like sorry if someone like yeah trying to count a spell a what's a bad fourth level spell.

What have I got prepared? Fucking I don't know control water Like it takes the same level three counter spell check to counter spell a control water or a wish

[Speaker 1]
It's the same And it's just the spell casting ability modifiers if Rana would get a plus seven

[Speaker 2]
Because I was 24, oh I was gonna say it's your wisdom that Yes, no only abjuration wizards get to add their proficiency to that bullshit because they'll do a little scheme and bastards All right, I'll be right back Apologies You're fine

[Speaker 1]
And it would be a skill check wouldn't it so things like enhance ability would benefit it. Yes Hmm Okay, Rana might take a crack at the they don't know that curse do they Yeah Rana would have to pick up on being cursed.

[Speaker 3]
So maybe after the adventure she'll realize that's happened Something Rana could do is do like a research downtime action on the symbol that she saw or somebody right somebody else good and That's a method of oh Shit, what did I what did I see there?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, someone else might have experienced this before and they might know how to remove the curse rather than abjuring it. Okay Written gear that was his fucking name. That's what we named him I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. There's a dwarf. I don't know if you remember this guy.

I don't know if you played with this guy ever but There was a dwarf friend at There was there was a dwarf friend at the battle for white for the white orchid Karen I Think it was Paris second session in and she still has this guy's coat Yeah where the party ran in and took out took out a camp and attempt to figure out where the Princess was being held That's where they figured out the information that they were actually in the white orchid Karen

[Speaker 1]
I think you mentioned him when I rolled a dwarven ambassador

[Speaker 3]
That is

[Speaker 1]
Good and I should have used my genie wish on something better than rescuing children It was really good That was really good

[Speaker 4]
Oh my gosh

[Speaker 3]
It was now admittedly. It was at a point in the campaign.

[Speaker 1]
We're like we were not able to take full advantage of those effects Yeah The if I just used the wish to make myself stronger than I could have saved more children than whatever would have been Now I saved a lot of children and on mentally scarred them. It was That's why I would not have done that I should just get wish and wish for the book to be back All the ways to get wish in 5e of being a wizard or a sorcerer ring of wishes ring with iron flask Luckily bottle there's a whole bunch. I really like Brady's afraid.

He's Chad's

[Speaker 3]
They're fucking awesome, there's a reason they're on the first edition DMG cover

[Speaker 1]
The ring of wishes you cast wish so if you are unable to cast wish then let's use So you might as well make your first wish the best one Really like wish because it's like you can create an object up to 25,000 gold in value Like you could just wish to steal someone else's object of the exact same thing, that's free

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll mark down the 31st is when you guys get to Tell me a current date right now.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I'll add a note for God epic gamer really speed Ryan getting kicked from the server.

[Speaker 3]
That was amazing to me. Hey, I got this kid Hey, I got that. Hey, hey, hey, hey Okay Didn't even make a thread for it.

I told him exactly where to go for that fucking character I'm wondering if he made let's see here. I kind of want to be its carriage. I want to know if he actually made a Barbarian one.

Yeah, just didn't even fucking think about it XP Milestone yes, that is correct for this game Does have two stats that are above a that are above a 15 Is a first level character I Do like that.

[Speaker 1]
He sent the D&D beyond sheet as an actual character sheet PDF. I don't like looking through

[Speaker 3]
It'd be

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm sorry James I was gonna stab it next turn but the dragon died so cold scenic dagger remains What you get for not having miserable combats the enemies of like 600 health

[Speaker 3]
This is the first time I actually left the enemies HP up

[Speaker 1]
It was really well, yeah, no, I agree I Give all the the shadow harpies had like 60 health that would have sucked us But I think it's fine for like a dragon to have a bit of beef

[Speaker 3]
They're like the one exception. I think I'd said in that hit points video like that. Hey, this is like my one exception to this rule Like big monstrous things or all horses I Will yet again pat myself on the back.

What a fucking awesome Feature that's a make use of Really like the the walrus made all the saves.

[Speaker 1]
Well, what are the odds?

[Speaker 3]
Very low, but you know what that that was perfect

[Speaker 1]
exploration rules

[Speaker 3]
You make your check you have to have an extra you get the wild shape an extra thing upwards That's perfect Oh

[Speaker 2]
Apologies, I'm back Have I missed anything

[Speaker 3]
No, no, we're just waiting car winner you back

[Speaker 2]
Or

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, my parents got back from their hockey game like 10 minutes ago, so I was on mute but I've been here oh, okay

[Speaker 3]
Already, so I'm gonna drag people over Figure this and make sure that the lighting is I

[Speaker 4]
Love that we killed the dragon before the harpies got there so it was like they were all flying in to fuck us up and then they just saw their boss die and just 180 degrees turned around and was like nope.

[Speaker 1]
We're out of here I saw my boss getting active like hell. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Hey Dale I'm going to drop the players. Oh because of the fucking walls. That's right Maybe So what's happened so far after the dragon died is after a couple of hours the the moon Effect faded for Anna for a little while But after a few hours Basically at the start of the next dawn They're sorry.

No at midnight that night the moon reshifted back over to a more Like came back into view and it was quite close to its original position I was trying to lead you to Sick, I'm gonna draw just a couple more walls over here Make them all nice and craggly All right, there we are I'd love for folks to drop themselves. I don't know what you guys can see but I would love you to drop yourselves at the Bottom left right bottom left center.

[Speaker 1]
This looks dangerous This is the characters going into the dragon then need Mmm, that's Jesse.

[Speaker 3]
I his pistols loaded Already, so who do we have coming in for the for the party here?

[Speaker 1]
I have Sierra and Jesse Already and Cairo, which characters are you bringing it?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I thought I'd bring both since nobody seemed to like the idea of leaving Bix on the boat All right, and then Morgan and Ziona come along.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, Morgan and Zion are here Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
All right. So how's the party approaching this you guys going loud?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think I as my stealth experts Yeah, I think we're going loud Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
How lit is it in here much light?

[Speaker 3]
It is dimly lit except for the areas that have a lava just kind of spilling out of the walls.

[Speaker 1]
Those are bright light Hypothetically, how quickly does lava kill a person Jane? Assuming they're not immune to fire Soon, they're not immune to fire.

[Speaker 3]
You would die pretty quickly You wouldn't melt quickly you would more like evaporate quickly if that makes sense, yeah I think it's like one round Good to know if it's like if you're if you're like immersed in it then and yeah Well, it's hard to sink into lava because it's stone.

[Speaker 1]
So Nothing's pushing you down hard into it if that's happening Mm-hmm this earth elementals earth collide work on lava Yes. Yeah, I said Yeah, I would suck for it That is my inane hypothetical rule squish Awesome God Sierra has a lot of health. Oh, I've missed with her Foraging she got 180 temp HP Very I didn't want her to fight before the temp HP run and she bites Who wants to lead Morgan or?

[Speaker 4]
Get early Fine, I can't transform to it through all these weird areas too much lava Jesse has his heavy Hold on Before you go too far ahead I see Something with a lot of heads ahead and I'm willing to bet is a Hydra.

[Speaker 2]
Oh It's time It's trying to be quiet then.

[Speaker 1]
I Think we should just be quick Sierra says Okay I Just have the ranged people launch an attack at it as Sierra and Morgan rush it. Yeah at work to Jesse will creep forward sneaking along um My guys gonna are you in stealth? I just want to rush it.

I really just want to rush it Walking have to be to reach it attack I have a Dwarven throw. Oh, I didn't get in melee Sarah's just gonna um, oh, I guess we just roll initiative then right? Yeah doing that.

Sure Okay, fuck stealth pain in the ass Yes, nice, all right, Jesse's up first fuck what does Jesse do Um how They've clearly spotted us. How loud is a gun? Is that gonna aggro everything in this cave if I fire my revolver?

[Speaker 3]
It's gonna make stuff a little bit more difficult some enemies might investigate Um It's people Jesse has no damage spells.

[Speaker 1]
So he will just fire his heavy revolver All right, he has an offhand attack That hits There's the standard damage, he'll also do a Slashing flourish steals an extra five slashing damage With his offhand he'll shoot his light revolver Run out of its designated ammunition Just 2d4 8 Does an 18 hit the Hydra these are both at the Hydra. 18 hits?

[Speaker 2]
This one's This one's not magical piercing does 10 Cool that's Jesse done He's like flicking his pistols around Now it's It's All right, so that brings us to Morgan Charge forward I will bonus action enter a rage Once I find where it is, I'm on the wrong that's why I can't find it BAM Then I will I does a 24 hit. Yep. Oh Sorry Been so long since Jesse's done anything That's the extra cool All right, 17 magical bludgeoning.

[Speaker 3]
So I throw the hammer at it All right, 17 Is that the end of Morgan's turn that is all right that brings us to the heartbeat which is this one She's going to begin Singing her luring song 300 feet. Oh, baby. All right, so that's gonna be oh, I don't need to make my own wisdom saving throw But that is going to be everybody in the party Morgan is good.

This is versus charm. So if you had Jesse you'll spend two minstrel days Very nice.

[Speaker 1]
Does Jesse have counter charm at this level? He does That might have been a better action than shooting but any Other was a reaction Not by raw, what the fuck why does it exist? It's so bad fire Sierra needs to roll that assault.

Sorry Hey not walking into lava today Neither is the honor.

[Speaker 3]
All right, that's her turn.

[Speaker 1]
So we come to fix Um bonus action dash, whoa way too far Love track So good Seriously Not nice, all right Yeah, that's it Yeah All right, that brings us to Sierra All right, I'm gonna say stride, but this is off kind of bonus action rage Action attack she'll use her claws. I believe the first attack deals max damage 13 second attack I Raise at the end of the trip I Might have needed That's fine. I'll learn my rules next turn.

[Speaker 3]
That's her done But I figure you weren't gonna do the Flurry of blows given it was a second.

[Speaker 1]
You had to rage bonus action was rage I think she just gets a little bit extra damage with her. Oh First unarmed attack is just like max Yeah, I got that the thirteens there I think there's a little bit extra from manifest blow, but I'll find that out while it's not my turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay All right that comes to Sienna

[Speaker 2]
That's right now she can go faster cuz she's on the carpet like here

You didn't need to reckless That's fine it's about it's about it's about uh Yeah More importantly, it's about um, it's about sending a message about dying to these tyrants or so Yeah dying I Don't know man if a t-rex crits you they fucking her Yeah, I just take a flat half damage like I doubt it knocks me out a wild shape They would need to do 130 to knock me out a wild shape.

[Speaker 3]
It looks like big sizzle. It's gonna fail here. Uh-huh Bix you are nauseated at the moment Okay That is completely fair All right, that's gonna bring us to Sierra.

Sierra. What would you like to do? The thing is moving in the dark Bonus action dash.

[Speaker 1]
She is going to jump over the bear They see Punch this dinosaur in the face All right, so it should have been this one I should have rolled first This is a flat attack 20 hit your nose and It should be the versatile damage, which is a flat damage number. It is and her second attack is this one? That girl flat roll crit fuck That's brutal.

[Speaker 2]

I Have a stored one we thank you for reminding me Jack I remember the one time we did that in the entire room of enemies just vaporized With others when we TPK were you quickening that? Yeah, and then what are you doing just lost close on Okay, close ones also getting Eldritch blasted.

20 damage That is a hit You've taken nearly half my temp HP Most Of the damage that you're taking right now is just using your face to fend off the fucking jaw

[Speaker 3]
You're blocking with your wrists and and that's kind of how the temp HP is going down With your forearms that brings us to Cairo

[Speaker 4]
Rona has to move up cuz she can't see shit already I Still can't see shit So, that's it no

[Speaker 3]
Jesse You're boring and stuff like that from her on the corner

[Speaker 2]
Jesse takes a quarter Zayana would have that would have been exact lethal on Zayana if She has 65 max HP, she's a sock warlock Not stanky.

[Speaker 1]
Um, what's half of that 32?

[Speaker 2]
Wait, I need to take quarter. Hell. Yeah.

Thank you Hey, that would be my bear exactly thought if I wasn't raging and also failed Yes, he's down to 32.

[Speaker 3]
Oh All right, so right now Vix is retching That's gonna take up Vix's action, but she can still run around but they can still run around and Do the thing This way you start you throw up at the start of your turn the blood pulling at your feet and the rather Rank has to know of it has to untangle themselves from my guts. Mm-hmm All right, is that Vix's turn?

[Speaker 4]
Yes Because Yeah, I don't have yeah, that's it. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that's gonna bring us to Sierra She might as well attack the dragon since she's next to it Action attack the first attack has manifest blue It's a standard attack. There's an 18 an 18 does hit this we've established It's That's max damage, uh, I would like to use a key to stunning strike if it could make a con safe It's time James. Oh I will spend five herb dice Constitution say I Think it makes it still still makes it.

Oh, that's incredible. I'm gonna amazing right now Okay Our second attack, this is just a normal floor attack a 20 under here You've heard it before I'm gonna spend six this time That would be 3d 12 and 3d 8 Oh Through ones. Oh, all right.

It's done All right bonus action flurry of blows spending a key. They hit it twice more These have advantage because it's stunned it's That is Sierra's turn done She's just throwing oregano I Said I check against hate

[Speaker 3]
All right, that brings us to Xiana we're just strategizing

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I was gonna command the carpet to go back and jump up and then misty step and land on it Like a little bit back So There's no attack of opportunities Come on everything Just want to go for the dragon because you get advantage on it.

Yeah All right, Eldritch Blast with advantage on the drug on BAM Five force BAM. Yes, what the fuck? Oh disgusting, all right, that's All right now we come to the I would come to the Tyrannosaurus There's a bear in front of them They have advantage, oh they sure do.

[Speaker 2]
Bear that's okay half of 29 is 14 So I take eight and then six overflows to Morgan as the bear dies the total of 98 damage I Halved it, but that's okay. Yeah You have done six damage to Morgan

[Speaker 3]
Congratulations All right, that brings us to Chirona You could see just barely the image of heads fighting at Morgan

[Speaker 4]
Well, she can see the dragon, oh there you go I want to do anything No, I don't The only good thing I have for combat is Eldritch Blast I'm really good at it, but everything else is utility

[Speaker 3]
That's okay

[Speaker 1]
As you said that you are really good at it

[Speaker 3]
Like Damage and then another minus. Wait, do you have that thing that gives you?

[Speaker 1]
The other thing that gives you your ability score modifier No, it's boss at a bit Agonizing plus three.

[Speaker 3]
Well, no, it's a plus three. No, I don't it was wrong.

[Speaker 4]
I was like, wait a minute All right, is that her turn Oh, I hit it it is blinded.

[Speaker 1]
Oh shit Plus stun plus blinded Plus no Yeah scurvy All right, carry on One of the fun facts blade barbs get extra attack He hasn't used it yet And he isn't gonna use it this turn. He's using his actions to use healing hands On himself six very nice very nice Bonus action we can hit Ziana with a third level healing word Yo Man that it was average and just you'll start closer to the lava Getting out of the current position That is his turn done passes fuck All right, this is shadow dragon who is blinded and stunned and we move on to No, it doesn't Huh, we skipped Morgan.

[Speaker 2]
Oh shit. What's it me? Haha You're the best dog I will just hit once and then in my turn Damn Or do we throw it I Have a wild shape, but only got one left They can have me.

I Never get I get I never get enough through Morgan's HP. Uh, the while the bottom one boom 19 Wow It's a m14 Built him with the hammer, that's me done Already Now we go to the dragon and we move on from the dragon to Bix Sorry, I will also step up to the Are you are still within reach?

[Speaker 3]
Fix I assume that I don't going around or use a dash or disengage yourself.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Was I yeah, oh you want to get bit by a t-rex Um, I will use bonus action dash to stay out of their Attack of opportunity range.

[Speaker 1]
It sounds like a good idea the shame that would just be like Here and then I want to still be in range.

[Speaker 2]
I want to be near Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
I Think that's how this You've got the body right anyways Yeah, what is the bardic inspiration for you get to add a d8 to a saving throw or an attack roll or an ability check?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I will hold on to that for now.

[Speaker 1]
Sure princess to Sierra She will continue wailing on the dragon and is still stunned until the end of her turn so she has advantage on the first attack Which is a miss she hasn't hit an attack yet, so this is still her Manifest blue. There you go Here's the damage and she'll spend a key to do a stunning strike she has no more herb dice though Best magic item just straight up Max damage easy They're much better than bleed effects Bonus action she'll spend a key to flurry of blows. It is just the Advantage Advantage that hits she'll spend another roll the damage first sorry and then spend another key to stunning strike putting me to two 18 makes it she'll do one more attack with her last flurry of blows Advantage because it's still stunned it misses it is no longer stunned That is how long is it blinded for?

[Speaker 3]
For Kyrona's

[Speaker 4]
It is blinded until either the end of its next turn or the end of my next turn

[Speaker 1]
Okay, the end of its next turn so it would have ended while it was stunned No more advantage against it All right that brings us to Ziana We should move to perfect current spacing again, we all move up into here It's time

[Speaker 2]
BAM You should fly you can't see the point so just gonna do a little little little flying

[Speaker 1]
Oh Isn't it?

[Speaker 2]
It is a red shadow dragon again Yeah, but just to be able to hit these two without hitting anyone else You can hit Sierra. It's fine Yeah, but It's not what elevation she takes half damage she has temp HP I Will spell I'm pretty sure this guy's red. I forget whatever doesn't matter.

Cool. Cool. I'm Jesse got a 9.

Let's see here The car Rona was the only one that succeeded but now everybody has failed at least once So we will describe what that does after after the show The shadow the shadow dragon dissipates and you guys see that symbol once again That of a mast head with no facial features except for Elkhorns coming out where its eyes are supposed to be The I should note that the shadow dragon this area the shadows that's composed of have a far more greenish tink Itself you can still see the red scales underneath but like it looks like green and stringy I everything that's coming off of it That brings us to

[Speaker 4]
Are we sure it was a shadow dragon and not a snot dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Are we skipped Morgan again?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I will bash the remaining t-rex with my hammer Wait a minute What are the rules for ranged attacks so within five feet with five feet it's just a bad Yeah I'll step back. These guys look like they can reach pretty far. Oh Yeah, I'm pretty sure it has like a reach.

I have not left its range. I will throw my hammer 15 hits pog. All right, boom and Boom 25 damn it.

Whoopsie. Nope See, let me get rid of that. Oh 16 damage keep forgetting.

It's better to throw my hammer It's in the name Yeah, I Step back eat the hammer at it deal 16 step back it That's Morgan done Very good

[Speaker 3]
All right now we come to Bix

[Speaker 4]
Bigs gets to go stab tea stab tea

[Speaker 3]
It's 16 16 hits as a Class of 13

[Speaker 4]
There you go

[Speaker 3]
Princess to Sierra

[Speaker 1]
We can hit it with the old action attack Normal attack 13 I see I think you just said yep Minus action attack That's 19 37 that is her time She still has four rounds of for each left

[Speaker 2]
All right, we just use the honor Start with Eldritch blast and then We'll do the thing I know she's gonna do or she gets off the floor I Didn't wreck it reckless didn't it? I Think it recklessly attacked right? Yes, it did Yeah, okay.

So that's got a debate hits anyway, but fish for the crit. Nope, no crit I am seven force and then second beam also a hit for six force Full damage and then does the other have anything else to do on a turn? The scholar dice do you have the scholar stuff on here?

[Speaker 1]
After casting a spell you can spend scholar dice to do it a second time.

[Speaker 2]
I believe let me let me let me find the thing To read hold up. Sorry Secondary classes scholar Recast When that's from a scroll that's from a scroll Scroll binding No, that's twelfth And spend scholar dice to create a scroll and then you can cast it that would This is just making scrolls I Can calligraphy you can spend scholar dice to create a scroll last for a round. Oh Yeah, I can calligraphy it needs to equal All What action is that?

[Speaker 1]
It's a free action action.

[Speaker 2]
No, it is it is a free action Typically we solid ice things Otherwise Yeah, okay. So I assume it's part of the action to cast a spell So you'll expend a number of dice equal to the spells level. So what what do you want?

[Speaker 4]
Oh

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, James this is so if they make a scroll right with their free action would they be able to burn source Oh, no, you could just burn sorcery points making your Eldritch blast Bonus action and then it works the same way

[Speaker 3]
Okay, no, no, so you can do the I know what you're referring to you can you didn't go ahead and do that anyways

[Speaker 1]
Oh No, yeah, so three points of fire when you cast a spell so those three points apply to scrolls

[Speaker 2]
Um But it's also just She can just spend the sorcery point on the Eldritch blast and then just use the action.

Anyway, so yeah So casting for me scroll has a check doesn't it James it does Is equal time 10 plus these spells level?

[Speaker 1]
Is that a spell cost?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we have decided to call watching right? Okay Scorching right level two These all have advantage, okay. Okay.

Yeah, okay Let's just do the normals first 18 oh All right, that's fine 30 fire damage 30 fire damage.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
No, how would you like to do this? How would you like to do it?

[Speaker 2]
Three beams straight to the face Put one in the mouth. Yeah Boom easy done. I'm not in combat.

It's my raid my rake ends Oh Excellent I have this army of half these I can see T-rexes are native to the volcano, of course I'm pulling your beard Maybe a nature. I don't know why you do that.

[Speaker 3]
I Will make a nature check with plus three Okay All right, so all right Dinos do have a tendency to hang around dragons or other draconic creatures.

[Speaker 1]
I See that makes sense then All right Well didn't believe you do now So what are the half he's doing it's my next question it's kind of hanging out I did say we're killing everything The honor got me more fireball.

[Speaker 4]
Look if the harpies don't want to kill us. Let's leave him alone.

[Speaker 2]
So Anna has a wall of fire There's a little reaction and And we can still do the thing of like expending scholar dice to They failed morale. They're gonna go this way Well, I'm gonna quickly how many level one small thoughts have I got For I'm gonna eat all of them over four rounds just Doing some healing for myself All right, I wait for you to do yours Jesse's back to full. Okay, one two Three, that's pretty good guys.

[Speaker 3]
By the way, that was like three That was basically three combat encounters of one blue right fucking room in the time that You have one combat encounter, you know

[Speaker 2]
He'll All right, Morgan is to HP off max So he is very ready to go and I still have a wild shape and a rage held in the back pocket

[Speaker 1]
Sierra's gonna check over where the harpies were Morgan was going to follow along Jesse could be here in that time.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I know we'll soar on over in the carpet We get to move for a second round Sierra will move forward further Wait, so what we're doing again, okay on the dragon. Yes Consuming The two that we've already killed. Oh, are we just killing dragons in general?

[Speaker 1]
I need money These dragons have been harassing people of the lands Huh, I Want you getting for this? I Was hoping they'd have a horde.

[Speaker 2]
Oh You need money from the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
I see I see Well, I still got the pilot on if you need to borrow some I Keep that in mind this room besides heartbeat droppings and shit like that is mostly empty Where they just sit on the floor the fuck is like a nest. It's really filthy You can make an investigation check to look a little bit.

[Speaker 4]
Are they supposed to clean it up? They have wings for arms shit in the lava That is a good point. I take it back

[Speaker 2]
Like that's way better than just sitting on the floor and leaving it there Hanging out next to like piles of urine shit these things aren't cats They're like sapien like they have like a reasonably reasonable and well, they have enough intelligence to know to like trick kids down by the riverside, so

[Speaker 1]
Sierra has a check about she rolls 17 for an investigation

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna I'm just gonna give you 1d 8 in case that's too low BAM 24. You're welcome.

[Speaker 3]
Nice Okay, so looking around oh you see there's more harpies down that way the same hobbies Oh, sorry You see a few let's see here a Few symbols and basically How do I put this? There's like a bunch of different talismans or charms or like really minor artifacts That I don't have any don't have any value but like are clearly not crafted by something with wings for hands, you know

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Do any of you know what this means Sierra Does

[Speaker 4]
Would that be Arcana or what Arcana would be go home I get a 17

[Speaker 3]
I think What was that shit down, there we go So the 17 you're looking down with this there's a lot of Kind of hedge mage Paraphernalia here people who are not terribly good at practicing magic on their own will usually turn to spirits Or Faye or something like that in order to acquire some magic for themselves and it kind of looks like Somebody was interacting with these harpies for that purpose

[Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm

[Speaker 3]
There's a bunch of protective charms or charms for basically either, you know affinity charms, I'm going to say where See here you're familiar with sometimes magic users will use this to keep hordes of if they've Amassed any kind of like hoard of personal monsters or monsters for personal use Especially if they're stocking a dungeon with them They'll use affinity charms to keep them from like actively hunting each other down constantly and killing each other hmm How to keep them in the same place without perishing these ones in particular Have the mark of three razor blades That are kind of assembled like a Swiss army knife except they look far more I say razor blades But no razor blades are normally like very straight edge and stuff like that. These have a certain art nouveau to them That does not resemble anything human interesting Out of character.

[Speaker 4]
I am a bit too tired to Understand the implications. Can you be clearer? Yep.

[Speaker 3]
This is from a Faye Okay. Thank you Has Chirona was Chirona at the party out of curiosity?

[Speaker 4]
What party? Oh, yes party.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Chirona would recognize this as one of the symbols of Camphasia Okay. All right.

Are we moving on or what? Let's take a quick quick five-minute break So I'm gonna fix something up and then if you guys won't look around for the treasure.

[Speaker 1]
It's the matter of Locating it Oh Right Welcome back as am I Do you mind ending the combat encounter James we can see our total movement for the round There any treasure in the north area near the lava James Go ahead and make me another investigation check. Sure. Do I need to jump over and be in there to check it out?

[Speaker 3]
Probably Oh

[Speaker 1]
You'll get a running jump

[Speaker 4]
We could throw the dwarf

[Speaker 2]
You can try he's quite heavy

[Speaker 1]
It involves touching the dwarf though

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's also not advisable

[Speaker 5]
All right

[Speaker 3]
Oh Okay, so you find a hidden cache of gems and the light Gems jewelry, etc with a book that seems completely untouched by the heat And During your investigation you notice that kind of sounds like there's stuff happening Behind the wall of you don't know how but like there's a wall of lava.

You're just kind of like pouring over And it sounds like there's stuff happening behind that There's an echo behind it. Sorry, go ahead. This is the pit of an illusion I Best You're pretty confident, it's not an illusion You're everything good over there.

[Speaker 1]
I Found some things and there's something behind this wall. She just How well do you go with lava Not too well, that's what this for Fuck it's gonna eat the hammer out of it.

[Speaker 2]
Nope fire elemental All right, go check it out It was in the other room for a few minutes comes back Do I speak thingy? Ignan or elemental does anyone speak elemental or primordial? I guess it is or primordial.

Yeah, I Think Xiana has comprehend languages, right?

[Speaker 4]
Even better Hirona does not have Comprehend languages, but she speaks celestial common Elvish giant and sylvan If he's casting tongues on the fire elemental, yes All right touch it Yeah The fire elemental Can the fire elemental stop you?

[Speaker 2]
I think the fire elemental if it is touched does deal damage, I believe Oh, there it is loaded now

[Speaker 1]
It's 1d 10 Entering so I assume that would be the same

[Speaker 2]
It's with a melee attack takes it's touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack takes a d10 Be quick be quick

[Speaker 1]
Blimey Jesse does

[Speaker 2]
All right, can you go check in there for me as you wish just flies in there

[Speaker 3]
right, so it comes when it comes back it says Let's see here. There's there's a lot of treasure behind there Damn it And I spell suck dick for this today Fuck is doing here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, but I do have Useless I'm gonna go fucking insane.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. One sec here.

[Speaker 2]
This is what I get for not bringing my wizard again You know wizard I made a wizard for The heist but I didn't I was making them as we were doing the high so I didn't exactly have them ready in time

[Speaker 1]
Fancy I need to finish my new character

[Speaker 2]
I Know I discussed them with you on there on the day James whenever that happened Well, I'm on for go or whenever they're a graviturgy wizard Yeah, looks looks fun to play I just haven't had and it's like oh what are we doing today? Oh, we're going to hunt down a very dangerous creature. Well, I'm probably bringing morgue well We have wall of stone Maybe with wall of stone we make a tube

[Speaker 3]
They just haven't come out sideways instead yeah

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so I like flows this way

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, make makes it a lava flows out to the to that side That seems reasonable

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I'm still just rolling up treasure to try to verify that this thing's not working in a stupid fucking fashion

[Speaker 2]
What challenge rating five elementals are there Fuck I'm an idiot.

[Speaker 1]
Give us the goods James

[Speaker 2]
All right, Jack remind me next time that we need again the way we're in exactly this scenario I can summon a zon Yeah, those are the treasure sense pinpoint by scent of the location of precious metals and stones but just coins and gems Unfortunately, if I lose control of it, it's just gonna eat everything But then we can kill it and get it back if we need to holy shit, all right, let's see here holy Can I add new folders in here? I can I do not have permission sufficient permissions 15 gems worth a thousand gold pieces Each each, okay Oh They're getting added into the session report, never mind Can somebody roll for me on magic item table?

[Speaker 1]
I That's just a d100.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they're all d100 16 16 is a sort of oh my god. It's a sort of answering you need to roll again 369 one two, three, four, five six You need to roll a d9 Jack for which sort of answering we get unless James wants to choose. No, go ahead Three and I'm a first concluder that is Yes, that is the amethyst as the lawful neutral one Well, that's a plus three long sword if if someone's lawful neutral and they can do the Yeah, hear me out we can sell it Well, sorry, it's it's it's a lawful neutral sword I don't think you need to know you don't need to be the thing.

This is awful neutral sword No, you don't need to be the thing Yeah, it's just a that's just the type it is holy shit, okay

[Speaker 3]
Actually, she's only many more magic item tables

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's still good but if you were better Jack that could have been a rod of resurrection theory or the well of many

[Speaker 3]
No

[Speaker 2]
No spell jamming until I get the the next game or a sphere of annihilation This is the this is the biggest this is the

[Speaker 3]
alright, so you guys got 15 gems worth a thousand gold pieces each you got 14,000 gold pieces and 2,400 platinum pieces along with the sword of answering Concluder I Don't look that up now.

[Speaker 2]
I've never seen that sword It's a plus three long sword that you can just like smack someone back with Like when yeah when any While you hold the sword you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals Damage to you.

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage on that attack roll and any damage dealt by this special attack ignores immunity and resistance Nice Legendary, I would like the arrows keep to take a cut of the money that we live in a tear of 20% Is that gonna upset anyone as that was the purpose of this mission? This is how much would that be The only stuff I don't want to sell off I don't really want to sell the sword of answering but I don't know I don't want to give it to anyone else and I don't think any of us can use it unless Kaironas are ranger. They're a dex ranger, aren't they?

[Speaker 4]
yeah, and Ranged ranger on top of that.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
She's got a plus one rapier anyways I I kind of just want to sell it.

[Speaker 1]
How much is a legendary item? What that's gonna be a lot of money.

[Speaker 3]
Oh It's it's gonna be difficult to sell unless you trade it in for like a comparable an item of comparable price But you can totally what we can swap it for them Say we're not doing XP for old So magic items to get levels Oh If there's anything similar on the table, you know, oh my god if you were all just 21's a holy Avenger.

[Speaker 2]
Oh That would have honor a holy Avenger And their cloak of invis iron flask, yes the pokeball Universal pokeball Oh There's two charisma casters here.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know how to decide who gets the tome of leadership and influence flip a coin well, no, actually, um, I think while I have Oberon's wreath my charisma is 20. Yeah, it is So nevermind.

[Speaker 2]
Oh So your charisma is already being like magically amped. Mm-hmm. Yeah Okay I'm happy with the honor to take it then You got a book?

[Speaker 3]
Who's the other might be able to buy an item with this?

[Speaker 2]
honest Christmas 16 Or we could lay a blight onto the world and give it to Morgan The last thing that man needs is to be more charismatic That one's also something we could sell but that one's probably good to give to somebody that That one seems good for somebody but it feels a bit oof to not use it when someone's already at 20 Well, like ASI still will put them above 20.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, true As it raises the cap by two as well, I think Yeah to a max of yeah, like All Right, you got you're taking it Oh Jesse's Jesse Jesse uses guns though. So yes, he uses cuffs He has one healing spell that's useful Find somebody down the sort of answering and turn it into a gun That'd be sick.

[Speaker 2]
Oh What about what about um The Bits I need for my bear armor Would somebody have the other bits? They'd just be expensive right or would I still have to go find them because we could like try and trade the sort of Answering for the other pieces. I need to get that made for your bear armor Yeah yeah, it'd be possible if people have the the resonance seeds from the underdog and the cloud forest oh

[Speaker 3]
That was the thing about the the resonance seeds, so those are made of metal so I switched that to the some material that they use in Certain cities of the underdog

[Speaker 2]
Okay but regardless that would be That would be acceptable either way Yeah, we could just trade we could trade the sort of answering for that stuff and get that made I I

[Speaker 3]
Don't know how much you would go to like a procure, so you would probably go to Markers make in shares and say like this is all the shit that we want and we have one legendary sword for you to

[Speaker 2]
Procure it yeah He could probably makes me some pretty sick shit with that if everyone's happy with that

[Speaker 3]
You guys would be able to get a lot out of just trading in the legendary sword

[Speaker 2]
So wouldn't just be like one item. Oh Yeah, no Or we could get just super good bear armor Probably an upper limit on that bear over the effect of this Do we just want to divide the goal between all the characters here Some of it was specific I think Sorry, so some of those numbers were per character and some were specific. I believe the top numbers the 4200 was just in a pile with all the treasure, but I believe the 15 gems and the gold and the platinum was per character Sorry per player.

Maybe I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that's it says a platinum pieces That is just a pile then. It's a horde we just Yes, there are two piles.

[Speaker 3]
There's a pile in one room and then there's a pile of the next.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so yeah I have done it right, but it's not 15 gems each. Okay left over.

[Speaker 1]
I think you said each to start with Maybe they're worth a thousand gold.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, so the 15 gems worth 1,000 gold pieces.

[Speaker 2]
I see I see I see It's like that's that's ridiculous, but that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, this makes way more sense than whatever the fuck I was smoking Would be dividing between There's Rana Maya, okay.

[Speaker 3]
So if you guys are going to divide treasure, by the way, well, okay So my the way I'm gonna be dividing the XP is between player Mm-hmm. I Guess technically speaking you guys could do you could do the same with treasure or you don't have to it's up to you guys How you divide it?

[Speaker 1]
I was happy to just divide this by character.

[Speaker 4]
I Am happy Morgan is happy with either I'm gonna head off for the night. You guys okay free to divide.

[Speaker 1]
However, you feel is fair See you later guys Who's gonna divide it by eight if you want to mix Gold around them, that's fine. But I think like a lot of this is just gonna be paid back to The keep is the honor and Morgan

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, if you just are you already doing like the calculations is just how much is there total yes

[Speaker 1]
And that's not selling all of the that's selling the crown the ring

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you've added that under your character sheet, yeah and then it's Five thousand seven hundred and ninety five gold per person Five seven nine five.

[Speaker 1]
How much do I owe Morgan still?

[Speaker 2]
Four four seven BAM twenty one two four two I Don't know taking him on cool adventures and he gets to sleep in a log near a place with infinite food He doesn't really mind you can pay him back whenever you get to it, but all like would never really Morgan's pretty chill

[Speaker 1]
Since the honor's taking The tome, I think I'll deduct that some of what we from what we owe Xehanort if that's fine with Charlotte Sort of answering what to do with it.

[Speaker 2]
Air armor would be cool, but it's a very expensive Xehanort doesn't really mind what you do with Yeah, Xehanort doesn't feel she's owed much, that's fine No, no, no, this is on the keep money the money I borrowed from Xehanort but the Share that you borrowed from Xehanort is just her part of the keep too, right? Like it's just the wizard tower like With Morgan you actually borrowed shit, but other things Yeah, I basically paid money to make a house for myself Yeah, so boom after the tome of leadership just call it square there it's fine And then Yeah, Morgan will take the sword so he can try and get a trade off Well, if you want to take the sword, I'm just gonna say that's even then Yeah Easy done.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I no longer owe people money from the keep I can focus on leveling up my dragon and my keep Yeah, well Morgan will take that to the procurer and try and organize his bear armor See how long that'd take to make There we go BAM XP's in the seven eight eight one That's per Person per player.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
How much do I need Jesse for him to level up? He's getting most of that Thank you, Jesse 48,000 minus forty three thousand three hundred sixty six equals four thousand That means we need seven thousand.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so I've added a new sound

[Speaker 1]
All right, there we go, let's see here four six three four So Jesse is now dead on level nine he is finally leveled up he did it and I didn't think it possible Now let's roll his health Not dog average Oh Fizzle more spells Yeah, he gets more spells yes, let's go So now Maya Rana and Sierra all get a thousand and fifty ish Not bad Not bad at all, let's see Rana just leveled up. Oh, she's already close to a right. She is doing lots of cooked stuff She is 3,000.

Maybe I just give the rest to Rana Emptying I'll split it up evenly I would that to just start casting dream on people He wanted a wrong long rest now, fuck you Rana is 3,500 away from

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna assume you don't want to do the bear on the commissioning stuff now That'd be something I'd have to chuck in the downtime channel

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so if you guys want to like figure out stuff that you want to treat in for the For the sort of answering that'd be in downtime. That'd be perfect.

[Speaker 2]
Well, yeah, like um, I Just don't know Cuz Morgan's not really after much more But I don't know how much more like of worth we'd have after he caches it in for Whatever upper limit there is for making the spare armor, you know Like as you said, it's probably it would make sense to me that there'd be much more like worth in the sort of answering He just doesn't know what the fuck he wants from that And I also don't know like what percentage of that is so I don't know really like what to ask for

[Speaker 3]
Well, it's okay so think of a budget of like 50,000 gold and then think of the budget of

[Speaker 2]
How much would the bear armor like The bits I know. Yeah, how much would like commissioning all the underdogs for that?

I should be all that expensive All things considered this can be like double plates like 3,000 okay, I Can just I'll just commission the guy. Oh I'll have the sort of answering and I'll trade. I'm just gonna add that to my character sheet and I'll think of something in downtime to trade that for and I'll Give my commission.

I like double the goal.

[Speaker 3]
He's saying it all thinking of items that she wants Well, the honor just got a tome It's it's our choice magic items that doesn't sound like We can we can look through stuff later We'll go get food in a minute.

[Speaker 2]
Um All right, I'll probably just like give the guy that's saying it'll cost like three grand I'll just give him fucking 6k and be like, all right, you work it out and hit me up perfect, perfect Yeah, true Hold up, let's make sure I'm getting the name right for Assurace, yep At 9th level I'll get an extra spell What can I swap out?

[Speaker 1]
What's a useless spell? Crown of Madness can fuck off Useless spell. Humanoid target garbage Do a good old Plutonium import and get some 5th level Oh shit, okay, um, let's see here.

[Speaker 3]
Kyrona is already familiar with this And Landi is already familiar with this, but Let's see here. Oh Is this the curse stuff?

[Speaker 2]
Morgan and Zianna are cursed. Yeah, Morgan and Zianna failed. Yep.

Are we cursed? What have you done to me? Cursed?

Very simple. You mended my butt crack? You bastard.

[Speaker 3]
I got shit pants. Nice try. I'm wearing a skirt So The way it works is that you will occasionally feel compelled Or be compelled rather to when you're coming across symbols of either the Green God of Orton or Or ritual sites or anything that has to do with either the Green God of Orton or Theresea the Marquis of the Light, a Winter Fae at Zephain's side You will feel compelled to tithe to her or contribute to her in some way Uh-huh And when this happens it will take the form of a charm But up until that point, it's just like a latent curse

[Speaker 1]
James, my kobold dragon's not sentient, is it?

[Speaker 3]
The kobold is not sentient though Well, time for that to change.

[Speaker 1]
Jesse's learning Awaken. Oh, that's so fucking cool Well, I can awaken everything like Amethyst Wyrmling? Awaken.

Morgan? Awaken. Awaken.

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 1]
You bastard.

[Speaker 3]
Is that gonna give him more intelligence?

[Speaker 1]
Gotta. What's this? My new character I've made is an auto-gym and he is an artisopher.

He is an auto-gnome Needed an artisopher. Auto-gym is the perfect... Oh, I know it's gonna be it's gonna be the um The auto-gym that was sent to retrieve stuff from a cannon and just followed him all the way back to the keep to get it to him It's out of wi-fi range of the original Gym Matrix.

[Speaker 3]
It's just like a fucking mind flayer escaping the college.

[Speaker 1]
Escaping the Elder Druid Oh, returning imports not working. I should have I should have been more patient Holy shit, this is gonna be great.

[Speaker 3]
All right, folks. Anybody got any more questions for me?

[Speaker 2]
Um Uh, does the armorer in Ashores have an idea of how long the bear arm will take to make or Is that about two months? Two months easy. Yeah, if you want to put that on the calendar, that'd be perfect uh, how do I Do that?

How do I how do I so how do I can I just It's a journal, yeah, so journal notes it's on the left hand side not the uh, under like token controls journal notes And simple calendar. Okay, so that's how you reopen the calendar. That's good to know And then it today is the 31st of this month.

So if I go to next month next month So they're just the 31st of Walia That's correct uh, so if I um Add new note to then bear armor is finished whoops bear morgan title morgan save note I forgot to finish the convergence pits. They have reset last month Ha ha ha whoops But you guys know how the uh mechanics work now you should be able to blow right through it Oh, hold up simple calendar and then So that's actually today Dragon hunt party arrives at their destination. Yep.

That's us. So 31st of walia 1056 and I put that on my sheet

[Speaker 1]
Thank god, it was a shadow attack jesse would have just fucking got corked Like wait, jesse's an asimo Wait, jesse's an asimo Perfectly planned for this moment items

[Speaker 2]
compendium packs Items and spells items, they're still

[Speaker 1]
Oh Uh, james, I actually have a question about getting home did we I guess i'll wait until the others are done here if they want to come home with us or not

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I can create a map note too, okay, that's how you do all of that. Excellent.

[Speaker 3]
All right, that's good to know Yeah, you guys can let me know during during downtime basically because para can probably Once the caravan actually gets there para can probably Oh teleport people home Can uh, we need to take the airship home.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, jesse learned teleportation circle.

[Speaker 3]
Oh fuck. Yeah So now he has something to consider for your keep You should really have somebody start casting teleportation circle there daily It takes a year doesn't it how much would it cost to pay a wizard to do that? That's the thing is it's been a year and uh, one of the first places that Para put down a teleportation circle was in your keep with that Make it last for a year hers lasts for a year, isn't there right We didn't get the keep straight away.

[Speaker 1]
Nope No, it took a few months. That was that was so when kesi was playing though. Hmm because that's That's that's when um hates Wild magic sorcerer died as I remember him sending the message to otter he fucking died After just saying how fun it is to play uh Bro I Wish god, I wish the campaign back then was like the campaign like it is now god damn it I want those guys back so bad Yeah um Last annoying question.

[Speaker 2]
Um Uh James look, how does this work? Is this like re so is this just plate armor sized for a huge bear with an enchantment making it compact or Can it like resize to different sizes of bear?

[Speaker 3]
different sizes of bear so if it's not going to be

[Speaker 2]
If it's going to be enchanted then yeah Well, so the initial thing is like I could just get it made and that would we could just carry that around But then I have to put it on every time I turn to a bear that's that's not very practical so the only like enchantment that's like needed on it is the ability for it to essentially, um, either be stored in like a pocket dimension or um like Stored compact in some way and it expands um Even if it's like an action or um something to do Some some way to like activate it You know

[Speaker 3]
All right there I found the message um, yeah, so Storing it compactly.

It's gonna be the it's gonna be the tricky part

[Speaker 2]
Yeah because I know that there's a couple of like, um Magic items and things where you can essentially like you dismiss them as like a shimmer, you know and Because if that's the case and it's just like something I can just summon like on and off like a like eldritch um Like a packed weapon then I could essentially like turn into a bear equip it and then dismiss it and then um just only re-summon it if i'm a bear because if I re-summon it when I meet I just get like Fucking I have a giant jumble of plates just appear over me and trap me I don't think that'd be it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna have to think about that. I got two months to think about it. Um, yep Two months to like this is a few there's a few different ways that that could go Um, all right I actually don't know if it's going to count as plate armor.

It's probably going to count as like half weight That's fine.

[Speaker 2]
I'm whatever like you're willing like the max you're willing to give me. I'm Is okay go go This is all on you. But yeah, so like, um, I am down to I'm down.

I'm, I'm leaving a very open-ended on just like either I can look for things that um, but essentially i'm looking for like what's the upper limit of how much am I allowed to like How much magical enchantment am I allowed to put on this thing? And for 6k it's going to be on the lower not for 6k Not for 6k. I have a lot more money than that.

That's just for that's just for the armor itself That's just for getting the materials to make just the armor And get the armor made getting the enchantments would be a whole new different ball game and I have a lot of money. So And the sort of answering and the sort of answering but I think i'll save the sort of answering to Like trade up for something cooler.

[Speaker 3]
I thought you're gonna have to like you're gonna have to like put more more material if you want to go much beyond just the Getting that armor chain to the specific way You're gonna have to put a lot more materials into it, which means it's gonna be a much higher cost or it's gonna be a much higher Uh, or you're like I gotta go find shit.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, exactly um All right well if I get if I To start with if I like get it made with like some kind of like Compactment, um enchantment on it. Would I be able to go back and add enchantments to it later? Uh It's it's possible Okay, cool.

It's possible.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there's changing enchantments that that exist on there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah All right. Well Um Hmm Leave that with me then and I will give you like an initial like you're looking for a compact enchantment

[Speaker 3]
You're looking for a specific kind of creature that can do that for you

[Speaker 2]
Okay Um, yeah See here because i'll probably look through some magic, um Items and see if there's anything I specifically like want to pay to put on it In addition to that like summoning like resummoning the armor enchantment And once I have that I will uh Probably just leave it there for now and then have the room to like maybe upgrade it later for more cost

[Speaker 1]
Hot dog.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. All right I'm gonna enter this into Here's the secret block. Can the players see this?

Let's see here. Can you guys see the book at the top of the uh at the top of the screen there? Uh, yes Okay Go ahead.

[Speaker 2]
You should all have show players Corner Now I I did for a second now I don't what the fuck Um That's a good question from charlotte is getting rid of this curse going to be Tricky and like we'll need a quest for it or can we just like get someone to cast remove curse and that should be fine We need to research it.

[Speaker 1]
We need to research it. Yeah Rana's gonna be figuring gonna be looking at it because she's one of the few that's not affected by it right now Yeah, she gets to spend the airship home with you all being weird. So she'll fucking this isn't right Okay, I have the option to add a page now Okay, are you do?

Great new page rana. Yes Oh, you know what?

All right, morgan. Tell me if you find that thing go go ahead and click on that I've arrived.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's all it's all there. All right, I need to find a novelist Perfect I started building enough that someone with the bits gives it to me Which I don't know if that I don't know how rare these whatever they are are so

[Speaker 3]
Dome of this are fate But in chapter is going to tell you that dome of this are fey that usually don't get along with dwarves But very rarely they can be found in dwarven holds um, they're They're pretty suspicious of the dwarves normally, but they're happy to there's certain things that you can Do to gain their trust and once they do have that trust with the dwarf, they're like lifelong buddy They're like paired for life and they'll give you enchantments

[Speaker 2]
Sick Okay, so I would need to yeah So I would either need to find someone who's already buddies with the dome of this and is like already an enchanter probably Or I would need to go make friends with my own dome of this Exactly

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my establishment's gonna be finished in five days Okay, it's only been 90 days since I ordered it Unless they can't build all of the structures i've built at once That would mean I would need to wait Over a year and a bit for everything to be finished. I assume I could get separate workforces to build different structures I have the money

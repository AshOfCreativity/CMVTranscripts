[Speaker 1]
Cool. Alrighty. So, the team that is currently at the Glassblowers Academy, you folks are going to be approached by one of your professors, because a bunch of you came in asking to do new spells.

I mean, one of your professors is going to be, I believe it was Professor... Uh, not Hackett... Professor...

Herkul! Professor Herkul comes to you folks and says, Well, a few of you have come to ask me about learning new spells and learning some new techniques on recommendation of the Headmaster. I understand you've recently earned a small portion of his trust, which excites me.

I always appreciate more experienced students. But, as part of your assignments for learning these spells, I'm going to have you gals go out and acquire from me a few ingredients.

[Speaker 4]
What ingredients might they be?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see, let's see. Well, we have two options. Either you can go to the Cloud Forest, that's something of a trek, that's really where my ideal ingredients are, or you could go to the Forest of Sunflower Banyans.

That's south of here. The specific ingredients are generally from the Cloud Forest. It's fish from that particular realm, preferably magical fish.

More magical aquatic life, if you can find it. I find it quite helpful for flitting about. And given there's a rather terrifying wall of ice coming down the valley, I would prefer if I had more potions of Wind Walk and Gashy Swarm.

I think those are good preparations, so I'm going to send you lovely women to go out and acquire it for me. But, but, but, but, if you cannot make your way over to the Cloud Forest's newest teleportation circle, a time whale, well, that's a brown mark. You can always substitute this with some ingredients from the Forest of Sunflowers that lies just to the east of brown mark.

And for that in particular, I'm mostly looking for the sorts of ingredients that you might find on the ground.

[Speaker 5]
I think the Cloud Forest sounds the most interesting.

[Speaker 1]
It is. It's quite entertaining.

[Speaker 5]
Magical fish do sound fun.

[Speaker 1]
Now do be careful, it is dangerous. There are cloud giants to beware of, and she's leading you folks through the castle at this moment to take you to the teleportation circle. Did I mention the cloud giants?

I think I did mention the cloud giants already. There are a number of drakes in that region. Do need to be careful for those.

Oh, jeez, what have I... Well, I'm sure, with this old mind, I'm sure you'll be fine in that particular forest. Just be aware, if you have anything that controls the wind, that's generally quite effective in the Cloud Forest because it is literally...

it's clouds. It's clouds. The trees make clouds there.

That's probably the most important thing. So you might find yourself in a... with something of an obscured line of sight.

[Speaker 5]
Is there anything else that you can report to us before we make our way there?

[Speaker 1]
I shall think on this. She claps her hands and you folks go through a teleportation circle. What's wrong?

Nice.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, wizards.

[Speaker 4]
I'm the wizard, so watch your mouth.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So that's the point at which I'm going to let you folks go ahead and... link up with one another.

So the group from Sierra's Keep is going to be talking to a... or going to be looking for a ranger named Wayne. And it's pretty much...

according to the instructions that the guard receives upon the teleportation circle closing for the group from the Glassblower's Academy, he's also going to instruct you folks, oh, you're told to seek the ranger Wayne at this particular address for instructions on hunting potion ingredients. And basically the two groups are going to get parent-trapped into meeting at the same location while this ranger is not actually home. So, you can make your introductions.

I'm going to make sure that my coffee stock of Kraken Rum and water are all filled and that I am ready to run some... run a little bit of exploration.

[Speaker 2]
I'll start. My character Maya meets at the ranger's house. That's all there.

She has long white hair, big magical lenses covering her eyes and some kind of bodysuit monk thing. She's kind of a bitch.

[Speaker 3]
Can't we all?

[Speaker 5]
Pera is the sunniest and bubbliest little kobold you ever did see.

[Speaker 3]
Half-asleep on the back of one of the dragons that's arrived is a fucking homeless-looking dwarf covered in dirt and animal skins. He's just having a nap.

[Speaker 6]
There's a half-elf with plenty of books and potions by the belts and what looks like just standard adventuring leather armour and a bunch of colourful cloths sort of over it as well. Probably talking to some guys on building a potion shop because that's what she's doing right now. Very busy.

Busy, busy work.

[Speaker 4]
Melania is a yuan-ti, the more human variety. She's playing with some sort of metal contraption in front of her. Looks like a smooth metal ball that has shavings fall off and fade away as she moves it.

As she touches the ball, various little drones around her move around in buzz and hum.

[Speaker 5]
Just one second, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
All good?

[Speaker 5]
I have something planned out but I'm just going to improvise something short. So, Anai is an astral elf and she's just kind of playing around with just basic spells and just not really being mindful of anyone right now. She seems lost in herself.

And something that you can see when you see her face is that her eyes have this sort of shimmering effect and that's because of the time she was lost inside the astral sea for 73 years. And it's kind of left her... She likes spaces out often.

Aside from that, she is fairly short, has long pink hair, and is kind of a bozo. Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
I had more, but I'm just shy. Sorry. That's okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that was plenty.

[Speaker 5]
I guess. It's scary.

[Speaker 2]
We would probably be there first. I'm going to assume you two approach us.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, being on dragons and all.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that would make sense.

[Speaker 2]
My artwork stuff. Ah, but either of you happen to be the ranger looks at a note, Wayne. No, you don't look like rangers.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think my name is Wayne.

[Speaker 4]
We did have a ranger with us last week, but he's not here now. Don't think his name is Wayne, though.

[Speaker 5]
The fellow did have a giant frog named... what was it? Jonathan?

[Speaker 3]
Jonathan?

[Speaker 5]
That's his name?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Jonathan. Don't open the door, Jonathan.

[Speaker 1]
Jonathan, you stay behind at the glassblowers. You're still training a new pet, which is Nathan.

[Speaker 2]
Frogs! I see. So what brings you to the ranger's house, then?

We were told to meet him here.

[Speaker 4]
We were sent... You can go, Taker.

[Speaker 8]
No, you can go. It's okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Well, we were tasked by one of our professors at the glassblowers' academy to find some ingredients for him. For some potions of...

something to do with slow falling.

[Speaker 5]
Windwalking and gaseous form, I believe it was. Yes. As mindless as I can be, I remember things sometimes.

Yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it doesn't look like this man is here. I am going to see of his home. Maya's going to break into this guy's house and figure out where to go to this.

What the fuck? She'll go around the back and shadow step through a window or something. Maybe next time.

[Speaker 8]
If the house explodes?

[Speaker 2]
Don't worry. Maya can only roll badly.

[Speaker 5]
This is funny. What?

[Speaker 2]
Rolled a three. And then a con save, you said? Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Oof.

[Speaker 2]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you were hit by a bunch of cordoneveros with a paralytic poison on top of them.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not immune to poison yet. I multiclosed. No.

[Speaker 4]
I presume after we hear a big crash and bang and somebody falls over I'll go around and take a look.

[Speaker 1]
Amazing, so the you see a burly old man who's probably not burly hunchbacked, really having a trouble time walking coming down with a walking cane and a double-barreled shotgun. Why are you in my house?

[Speaker 2]
Am I able to speak while paralyzed?

[Speaker 1]
Start talking or I'll start shooting.

[Speaker 2]
Just frothing at the mouth.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, do we hear this? While we're just standing around?

[Speaker 2]
You would absolutely hear this man scream. Oh yeah, did you break into his lair? What am I saying?

I didn't break, I teleported, it's just entering. I'm the one that's broken.

[Speaker 3]
You're right about that.

[Speaker 2]
Can I try and break out of the paralyzed to talk to this man before he blows my head off?

[Speaker 1]
Sure thing.

[Speaker 8]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Alright, so, what is everybody else doing as you're watching this scene unfold in front of you?

[Speaker 5]
Can we actually see him through the window?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can. There's actually quite a few windows in this house.

[Speaker 5]
Is he actively pointing the gun? Oh yeah. Pair's gonna knock on the door.

Frantically. I think at this point, to prevent someone from getting shot I'm gonna just try and hold person. Well, that might make things even more awkward but he has a gun.

[Speaker 4]
You could always try a vortex warp.

[Speaker 5]
Or I could, if you would prefer. Vortex warp them out of there, maybe? Yeah.

Well, I'm still thinking you can try what you wanna do. I don't wanna hold up everybody.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well the thing is that they're technically behind full cover because of the glass window. Would you let me do it anyway? James?

[Speaker 7]
Sure.

[Speaker 6]
What is a vortex warp?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's a teleportation spell where you can teleport somebody else. But yeah, so I'll teleport you out. You either make a con save or you can choose to fail.

[Speaker 2]
I consent. Get me out.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so yeah, you appear next to me then as I expend a spell swap.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just be frothing at the mouth.

[Speaker 4]
Learned your lesson yet? Maybe you shouldn't just break into random people's house.

[Speaker 2]
Does the poison wear off eventually? Do I take damage from the arrows as well?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
How much?

[Speaker 4]
Shouldn't have reminded them now.

[Speaker 1]
And six poison. Oh. That's okay.

Alright, so the man goes walking outside, he's like, Well, I certainly hope there's an explanation.

[Speaker 4]
Shove my afford. It's up to you now.

[Speaker 1]
Didn't think you were home. I can see that.

[Speaker 2]
We just wanted guidance on where to go. We are looking for... Did we ask about the cloud forest or just...

We got sent to the ranger in general.

[Speaker 5]
About... I think it would be wise to mention both considering he just had a gun pointed in your direction.

[Speaker 2]
Probably. We're looking for potion making materials. We were told to come find you and...

Well, I was finding you. By my own method.

[Speaker 5]
My friend here thought you weren't home, so...

[Speaker 1]
Well, I wasn't. And then I was alerted. And then I came back.

[Speaker 6]
There we go, so it all worked out in the end.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, and nobody was hurt, so it's okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, you're still actually hurt.

[Speaker 1]
Hold on a second. Alright. First thing you want to look out for are the hide behinds.

[Speaker 5]
Do I sound okay? I just want to make sure.

[Speaker 2]
You're a bit quiet.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was just going to turn you up a bit.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I turned everything up. 10 healing. Thank you, Zianna.

Ow. Lay magic arrows or do I have to pull an arrow out of my side?

[Speaker 1]
That's a really good question. I'm actually not sure.

[Speaker 4]
It's four pieces of non-magical. And then they become magical when you lay magic upon them.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. In any case, what are you guys up to? Or what do you guys ask this guy?

He's just kind of like standing around like this.

[Speaker 2]
Can you show us? Can you point us in the right direction so we can get out of your hair?

[Speaker 1]
West.

[Speaker 2]
What should we be looking for specifically?

[Speaker 1]
Clouds.

[Speaker 2]
Can't argue with that.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, like, are you seriously venturing into that place? Because it's not healthy. Well, that's...

[Speaker 5]
We killed a pit fiend. Last week.

[Speaker 6]
Last week? Yeah, I think it was last week. I think we need just a little bit of guidance once we're in there to figure out.

Pretty much figure out where to go. What to do, what not to do. You know, just the general guidance you could give us.

[Speaker 1]
A bit of help we could pay. First of the month. Alright, tell you what.

Here's the thing I'm worried about right now. You folks look to handle yourselves pretty well. What I want, in exchange for my knowledge and help, is I want to live and hide behind.

[Speaker 6]
Pardon? Hide behind?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Hide behind.

[Speaker 6]
I want to live and hide behind.

[Speaker 1]
I'm told they don't exist. But that didn't help my dad when I watched him get grabbed up in front of me, and it's haunted me ever since, coming out of that damn forest. I never even found the body.

I had to settle for that, but chances are you're never going to find it. So the Cloud Forest is a section of terrain, and it sucks like reciting this from memory, a section of terrain in which the clouds produce water vapor, moisture, rather than actual leaves. They do it in the shape of leaves.

It's a magical forest, and it's produced, well, whatever you would expect out of a magical forest. There's magical fish in there. There's magical chipmunks.

Some magical toadstools in there. They're called feebstools around these parts. If you see them jumping around, they're friendly.

They work pretty well as slingshot ammo, and they don't mind too much either, which makes them better at it.

[Speaker 5]
I'll be sure to keep that in mind in case I use a slingshot sometimes.

[Speaker 1]
Here's the key. When night falls, first off, that's when the highlights come out. So if you see any arms reaching for you out of the dark, I don't know, pray and run.

They're really good at scooping folk up. Second thing, they tend to live in the lower forests. Here's how you know what's going on.

If you snap your fingers, this is how you tell altitude in a place like that because you're not going to be able to see the sun or most of your surroundings. If you snap your fingers and it doesn't really snap, you're in the lower forest. You're probably in one of the ravines.

If you hear an echo to what little bit of a snap you actually can get out of it, you're definitely in a ravine. That's step one. Step two, when you're in the highlands, that's where the cloud giants go walking around.

The hide-behinds never go near them. They always avoid them. That's why the cloud giants hate it because they can't find them.

In the highlands is where you're going to listen for the sound of running water. If you follow any bit of running water, you won't be able to find it otherwise. If you follow any bit of running water, it will eventually lead you to a pool.

Around that pool is where we always got our ingredients. I've never seen that. Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I was just going to ask two things, actually. Do you happen to have a map of the forest? And that pool, is that where we would find magical fish, you'd say?

[Speaker 1]
You can. I would imagine that there might be a lake somewhere inside there, but we never charted it.

[Speaker 4]
I guess we'll just have to see.

[Speaker 1]
I can start scribbling on the map here.

[Speaker 5]
I also apologize for interrupting, by the way.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine. Listen, not only have I been monologuing slowly, but we also have a little bit of input lag, which just happens whenever we have a Discord up with people from all time zones.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I just feel rude easily, and, you know.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so we're going to put these. Nothing to worry about, it happens.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So the hide-behinds are some... Is that a place or a monster that steals people? It's a monster.

[Speaker 1]
It's the equivalent of a cryptid.

[Speaker 2]
That's sick. Let's get into cryptozoology.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to maul it to death. Ah!

[Speaker 2]
We never saw Morgan again.

[Speaker 3]
It's like that post of just, like, if me and my friends found E.T., we would have beaten it to death with a rock.

[Speaker 2]
I assume the forest is too dense for flying about with dragons.

[Speaker 1]
You could use it to drop yourselves in. Yep, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not like we'd be able to spot the running water from our dragons, though.

[Speaker 1]
That's trouble. Most means of locating things don't work quite as well. They're unreliable, and this is the really important thing.

The compass does not work in the Cloud Forest.

[Speaker 2]
That's concerning. Is it some sort of magical veil over the forest?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's a magical forest, so I can only assume so. That makes sense.

[Speaker 2]
Well, thank you for not shooting me. I won't break into your house again.

[Speaker 1]
I'm happy to hear it.

[Speaker 2]
We will try and sort. We'll look into your missing father while we're in the area. Hopefully, things go well.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent, excellent. Alrighty. So, this is where we're going to take a short break, and we're going to finish prepping this stuff.

Okay. You guys want to come back in, like, 20 minutes?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, sure.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, my washing will be done in an hour, so I'll just need another break at that point.

[Speaker 1]
No trouble at all. I didn't know where folks were actually going tonight.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I should have been more specific. To be fair, I'm glad we weren't. In my defense, I didn't decide on Cloud Giants until just now.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, it's like that sometimes.

[Speaker 2]
I was really just thinking of climbing mountains and getting rare flowers and stuff, but this is way cooler.

[Speaker 1]
It's probably going to be pretty similar.

[Speaker 2]
It all works out in the end, then. I'm going to get a drink. I'll be back in a moment.

Are we able to take a short rest before leaving? Sure. My key back.

Easy clap.

[Speaker 4]
Do we know how long the journey will take?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, this will be your first time going through the exploration system.

[Speaker 2]
How many days' flight to the forest I can organize?

[Speaker 1]
Between 250 and 300 miles. How fast do the dragons move again?

[Speaker 2]
I've got the Cobalt here. I think their flight is 60. Yep, their flight is 60.

Their ground is 40. Making the dragons go on foot would be pretty funny, but I think flight is better. For obvious reasons.

[Speaker 5]
With flying, we can't pick herbs or stuff, though, on the way.

[Speaker 2]
Right?

[Speaker 7]
You can.

[Speaker 2]
We're going to have to be stopping, because this is a bit further than what we did to Cydostal. We pretty much flew the entire way to Cydostal in one day. This will take us at least two days or so.

So if we stop, we can storage in between. Because travel consists of 8 hours per day normally or so. Plus the dragon's land, we've got all day to set up camp and mess about.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Over an 8-hour travel period, you would get about 56 miles per day. I think the game also has rules for pushing those guys to about 12 hours.

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to push the dragons. They are good. How many of us are there?

We have enough dragons for everyone. I assume we've each flown a dragon here, but we can double up. So we would have four dragons.

[Speaker 4]
How many of us are there, though?

[Speaker 2]
Six? Five? Six?

[Speaker 3]
It is six.

[Speaker 5]
I can double up with somebody.

[Speaker 2]
Who would like to come on the slightly wild Cobalt Dragon with Maya? The others are kind of all nice and tamed.

[Speaker 5]
I think I would prefer a more tamed one. So does it ride with the millennia?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to take you guys four days or six days, depending on whether or not you fly for 8 hours or 12 hours on a given day.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go with six days. That gives us lots of time to forage on the way as well. Unless people are in a rush, then we can feed them up, but I'm not.

[Speaker 4]
I want herbs.

[Speaker 5]
I also want herbs because I'm an herbalist.

[Speaker 1]
I'm fine with that. I don't know why that just became the most popular one. Actually, Minstrel was coming up.

Minstrel and an herbalist. Everybody wanted to do that. For some reason, I guess that was the fantasy that D&D just never fulfilled on.

[Speaker 2]
These look quite powerful, though.

[Speaker 5]
I figure herbalists make sense for a healer. And I'll admit, let's see if I can find it. I mean, being able to increase constitution saving throws is pretty good.

[Speaker 4]
Also, the actual herbs themselves are fairly strong. Especially since you changed house, you recover spell slots.

[Speaker 5]
I'm sorry, how many days are we traveling again?

[Speaker 2]
Six.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'm trying to figure out my nature's bounding really quick. So I guess I would roll 6d10?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 5]
1d8.

[Speaker 8]
I put it all in my sheet.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra has it, you're right.

[Speaker 5]
I have it here. So it's 1d10 per day.

[Speaker 2]
So you roll it at the start, and if you don't get it on the first day, then that's how many days I think it'll take to get.

[Speaker 5]
But also at 4th level, I think it becomes 1d8 from the Verdant Appraisal. Oh, okay. So I'll just do...

[Speaker 2]
So say if you roll your nature's bounty, d10, you get a 5.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. I got a 1.

[Speaker 2]
You get a herb. Sick, you get to do one tomorrow then. I got a herb!

A parrot won't get one until the fifth day of the travel. Yeah, it's a really good system once you get to know it. So with travel, I'm going to go over this while James is busy.

So we have declared we're traveling to the Cloud Forest. While we're traveling, we each need to take up roles in the group. I will go over those in just a second.

We need one success per day of travel, I think. So we need each of us to succeed on our roles. And we can use travel packs to re-roll a failed check.

So the roles are... It's essentially what you're doing on the trip. There's camper, cook, entertainer, fisher, hunter, survivalist, tracker, and vanguard.

So I'll get into those in just a second. Basically, I'm monkey. If there's anything your character's good at, then you want to pick a role that's to your strength, so we have a better chance of succeeding our journey.

Because if we fail the checks, we get an encounter, I think is what James does. Which is usually bad.

[Speaker 1]
But you guys just have terrible luck with your encounters. They're not supposed to be all bad, but for some reason you guys always roll a 1. Well, you see, Maya can't...

You are 15 plus creature attacks. Interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Maya can't roll above a 5, apparently.

[Speaker 7]
So here we are. Get fucked.

[Speaker 2]
So the camper, they are finding out campsites each night. That's typically like a survival check. I think there's only one.

You roll once for the entire journey. The cook is the same, they are making our food. That would be like a cook's utensils check, if you have that.

Or maybe like a survival check if James is being nice. The entertainer is keeping spirits up during the journey. That would be a charisma check of your choice.

For example, with Maya, I typically get her to tell outrageous lies and do a deception check. So this sort of stuff is... You can change it to suit your character better.

We then have Fisher, Hunter, and Survivalist. They each follow the downtime rules. I don't know if either of your new players have had a look at those yet.

[Speaker 5]
I looked at them a little bit, but a refresher would be referred to as this.

[Speaker 2]
So the Fisher one, it just follows the downtime activity. There's a couple checks you make. You can make one check per day, so you'd be able to make all four checks if you would like.

I don't know them off by heart, but I can check for you. The Hunter is the same and the Survivalist is the same. These are all downtime activities, you just do the same one there.

And that is instead for our journey. It's pretty much the same process. The Tracker isn't really applicable here.

So I guess we'd have to double up on something else.

[Speaker 1]
Tracker would actually be pretty handy. Before we get in the forest, though? Right, so the thing...

Even before you guys are getting into the forest, I assume stuff like that is good for, like, preparations. Like, somebody's thinking, like, alright, they're getting their oils, their bait ready. Making sure all their instruments, the party's instruments, are ready to go.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Well, yeah, that would be like a survival check as well, I assume.

[Speaker 1]
Often, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
But if you can justify it with something else, like, maybe like Arcana defines you now, magical tools or something like that. That's up to James, of course. Yeah, we'd need a Tracker then as well.

The final one is Vanguard. They are the one keeping an eye out. That's typically just a perception, as we're traveling for the entire time.

I have the fishing, hunting, and survivalist ones here now as well. So fishing involves survival, nature, athletics or acrobatics, lighter hand, stealth or wisdom, and then strength, athletics or wisdom. That's written weirdly.

But yeah, the fishing has four checks, you don't have to make all of them. You want to get more successes than failures, though. And foraging and hunting are more or less the same, but they have different proficiencies.

Who has the best perception?

[Speaker 5]
My perception is a plus nine, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I believe Morgan's is only a plus seven, but he usually is our usual Vanguard. I don't really mind. What else can Morgan do?

Well, very importantly, I believe I'm only a couple of days off finding a leyline.

[Speaker 2]
Is that something you can do while we travel?

[Speaker 3]
Travel, yes. Traveling or meditating. So how many days travel did you say it was?

Six. Okay, so in the first two, I gain a ley tap and I'll figure out a leyline. And depending on the direction, I get to know whether, like an encounter we might face too.

The Vanguard bonus from Druid, which was the one I was using before, gives me a free wild shape that's a level up. Like, um...

[Speaker 2]
Right, yeah, that was... I think it's best to keep the Vanguard.

[Speaker 3]
If we still go into a combat, like, I don't really need it. It's the same.

[Speaker 2]
It's a bit, uh... Anae? Or is that your character's name?

Am I saying that right, Fiori?

[Speaker 5]
One more time? Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Anae?

[Speaker 5]
Anae? Anae, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What's Anae good at, skill-wise?

[Speaker 5]
Generally everything relating to charisma. Because I have a post-7 in the charisma things for the proficiency. Do you have any other skills?

My other stats are not that high. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That's okay. That's it. What classes is Anae?

[Speaker 5]
Herbalist.

[Speaker 2]
In your main class?

[Speaker 5]
Sorcerer. And I'm also a Warlock.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so there are bonuses if you do really well at your role. So, being a charisma character, we're probably going to make you be the Entertainer. If you're okay with that.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

[Speaker 2]
As a Sorcerer, if you do well as the Entertainer... During a hardy rest, your party can add your charisma modifier to an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw once before completing their next long rest. Which is really good.

You could choose your Warlock one. It was Warlock, you said. Sorry, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I did say Warlock.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Warlock have Eldritch Lore, which... By sharing secrets and knowledge with your party, you can render them immune to some of your effects.

On a successful check, your party is immune to your Warlock spells and class abilities. Do you have AoE spells, really?

[Speaker 5]
A few, but I think the Sorcerer bonus would be better.

[Speaker 2]
I do too. Because that's a straight up just plus seven. Could you please roll a charisma check of your choice then?

[Speaker 3]
Jack, if you wanted Hera to do Vanguard because she's got better perception than me, I can absolutely just take Arms of Shelter. The Barbarian Camper one lets me just use an Athletics to build the campsite, which I've got a better bonus in.

[Speaker 2]
Do you happen to have the Minstrel secondary class?

[Speaker 5]
Me? No, I'm an Herbalist.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to spend two Minstrel dice to buff that. That buffs it to a 21. I think that's good.

Alright, 2d8 down. And, what was it? Melania?

Is that your character, Sona?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I was looking at stuff to see what would be best.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, what's your best stats and skills?

[Speaker 4]
Int, of course, and then Investigation and Arcana both are plus eight. And I potentially have Guidance if that's allowed.

[Speaker 2]
Plus I also have... Guidance isn't really allowed for these things because it's more of a long term... Then again, you do make one check, but I don't think Guidance can apply.

You can cast...

[Speaker 3]
We just have to go through the same thing that Steve did.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it's only for things that... Generally speaking, it's only class features or other things that would apply for the full duration. So if you have spells, or if you have a means of keeping spells up for the whole time...

That apply a benefit, that's totally fine. But besides that, generally speaking, it doesn't work.

[Speaker 4]
I do have, like, five summons.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Oh, actually... Jack, do we want me to go Survivalist?

Druid Survivalist gets to cast Locate Object for free. That's pretty good. And I can just look for any of the, like, plant or, um...

Jumping toenails? No, I can't do... I could do Tracker and do Locate Creature, but I think that's more narrow than just, like, finding something.

You know? Like, finding, like, a specific plant or some bullshit we're after. Um...

Well, yeah, listen, I've got, like, three roles I can easily slot into. So you figure out where everyone else is going, and... What are sauna summons, sorry?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, three tiny objects are Familiar, and also an Unseen Servant, but that technically isn't a creature. Okay. Um...

And potentially a Phantom Steed, which is a warhorse.

[Speaker 2]
What's your Perception bonus?

[Speaker 4]
It's crap.

[Speaker 2]
I see.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Yeah, I think we want me or Pera doing the Perception. Yeah, I do too.

[Speaker 4]
I am also an Artificer-Wizard hybrid. What's a Cleric Vanguard?

[Speaker 2]
Wait, you have Artisopher? One level. Does that give you proficiency with all your tools?

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 2]
Artisophers get... Cook's... Cook's Utensils are not a tool?

[Speaker 3]
They sure are. I checked last night.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, what?

[Speaker 3]
Oh my goodness, I'm getting... I'm getting... I'm actually lead by you, you fuck.

I took Artisans' tools. Cora, we're calling you off the bench!

[Speaker 4]
I have Thieves' Tools, Tinkers' Tools, and Artisans' Tools.

[Speaker 2]
Artisophers get all of them at some point.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I'm only taking one level. One level of Artificer than Wizard.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, it's definitely not level one. It is... Tool Expertise, level six, yeah.

My bad.

[Speaker 4]
I could help take the Vanguard, I suppose, with...

[Speaker 3]
That one also only doubles your... That one also just gives you expertise in anything that uses your proficiency for a tool. It doesn't give you every tool.

You get a lot of tools as an Artificer, but you don't get all of them.

[Speaker 2]
I'm getting confused, because you have the All-Purpose Tool, and so does Armor, and... Yeah. It can do Cook's Utensils.

So silly. Would... would, uh...

I could take Vanguard. I was thinking maybe Tracker, using your Tinkers' Tools, if James is okay with that.

[Speaker 1]
Yes! No, that'd be perfect.

[Speaker 2]
Could I please get a Tinkers' Tool check from Melania?

[Speaker 4]
With what proficiency? Uh, what stat?

[Speaker 2]
Justify any of them for me, please. Justify your best one. What is your best one?

It's easy, though.

[Speaker 4]
I have a 20 in Int.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. All I can do is I... Fine-tuning our battles and, like, magic items out of the way.

[Speaker 3]
Making sure everything's well-maintained. I got...

[Speaker 2]
I think... like, that's fine by me. I think that's good.

If you just... yeah, give us an Int. That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
I guess.

[Speaker 2]
I can't minstrel dice this. Please, you're all good.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not quite sure how to roll a Tool Proficiency check here. Wait, I don't even have the tools, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
If you just roll an Int Proficiency, uh...

[Speaker 4]
I know, but I don't have Tinkers' Tools.

[Speaker 2]
As a proficiency?

[Speaker 4]
I don't have the actual tools.

[Speaker 5]
Like, inventory-wise.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine. Maya has some, if you would like to borrow them.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll use those, then.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yeah. Funny. Hot dog.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, wait. Okay. I rolled with the wrong character, my bad.

[Speaker 2]
Is that... are the numbers still right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, 1D20 plus 8.

[Speaker 2]
Neat.

[Speaker 4]
I've entered in three Proficiencies.

[Speaker 2]
That's two successes. Alright. Parro, do you want to do Outcamping, or...

What would you like Parro to do?

[Speaker 5]
Um, I can do Perception. I wish there was something I could use Medicine for. Cooking!

Yeah. I don't have Cooking Tools. Would I still do Medicine for Cooking?

I mean, with Herbalist, you can increase Cooking with the Herb Dye.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you wouldn't be able to use your Medicine Proficiency. Um... But you would be able to increase the check with the Herb Dyes.

[Speaker 5]
Or I could increase the check if you wished. Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Just spend 16 levels of Herb Dyes on this cooking chest for the best meal we've ever had.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 2]
I also have something I can cook with. I'll do Survival for Myers. She'll do the Camping.

[Speaker 1]
She'll be back in just a hot second.

[Speaker 2]
So, Anne, could I have a Perception for Morgan's Vanguard?

[Speaker 3]
If you're happy with that kill. Let me just check on the Barbarians Vanguard.

[Speaker 4]
By the way, is there a rule for what the DC is for this check?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not...

[Speaker 2]
James, it's region-specific. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Got it.

[Speaker 2]
It's never been above 15, but it could be.

[Speaker 3]
He's holding all the DCs in his grubby little fingers.

[Speaker 2]
So... I know Xiana doesn't really shine at Travel.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I keep on rolling twos as well. Not just are my best modifiers plus two, I also only roll two.

[Speaker 2]
But we have enough successes that it shouldn't matter. Cool.

[Speaker 3]
Um... In case the DC... You know what, fuck, I'm not using these for anything else, and I lost my Focus spell.

I'm going to spend all of my Focus points cranking that to a 20. Nice. In case the DC is 20.

So... Those fucking cryptids got me scared. Caleb's scared, not Morgan.

Morgan's busy napping.

[Speaker 2]
Would Para like to do a Wisdom check for cooking? Yeah. Herb Dice the fuck out of it if needed.

But if you fail, I think it's fine. We've got three successes already. Now we need one per day.

[Speaker 4]
So I could help re-roll something if you need.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think Burning Herb Dice in this one is a good one. I didn't bring any Travel Packs to re-roll.

[Speaker 5]
Any Wisdom, or should I do, like, Survival?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think it would be Cook's Utensils for Proficiency, so...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, which I don't have. Does anyone have any that I can borrow?

[Speaker 3]
I've got these. I'm gonna double-check, but I am almost certain the answer to that is no. Tool Proficiency's Musical Instrument.

No, it is not me.

[Speaker 5]
I also don't have Proficiency for Cooking Tools.

[Speaker 2]
Para's Wisdom's pretty good. It'll be fine. We have Herb Dice.

[Speaker 5]
Should I just do a Flat Wisdom Ability Check, then?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, do a Flat Wisdom, and if James is okay with Medicine, we can add your modifier to it after the fact.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, my Medicine's a plus 13.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, diggity dog.

[Speaker 5]
Which is why I'm like, man, why did I do that to myself? Because I took the expertise in it, and it's like... You know, Medicine doesn't get used for anything.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like, it's identifying.

[Speaker 5]
Do you want to re-roll that? I have Chronoshift.

[Speaker 2]
I think just add Herb Dice.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, um, how many Herb Dice do I have? Did I ever keep track of that? It's the same as Hit Dice.

[Speaker 2]
And you would have got them all back after our pit-fiend incident.

[Speaker 5]
I can just use two at a time if you want, if that's easier. No, I don't use my Herb Dice, so it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Only versus pit-fiends. Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
No, wait, hang on, that's wrong. Is it?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that should be a D8. Hang on. I am a fool.

[Speaker 2]
Unless Para's taken some levels in Fighter. Seven's still good. Alright, so, we've got left for Zianna, we've got Tracker Survivalist to Hunter.

No, not Tracker, sorry, Fisher Hunter Survivalist.

[Speaker 4]
I did do Tracker, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, you did. Para's saying what we didn't do. Yeah, we've just got Fisher Hunter Survivalist left for Zianna to pick from.

[Speaker 1]
How many successes do you guys have so far?

[Speaker 2]
What's the DC? Alois so far has been a 20. Morgan used his Focus Points to up his Wisdom Check.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, perfect. Yeah, you guys are in the clear. And that was what, five?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that's five out of six we've done so far. We just haven't had Zianna make a check at all yet. Do we need to make a check per day of travel?

It's per day of travel.

[Speaker 1]
Zianna, if you just want to do like one check and chance it, or if you guys want to chance whatever the last encounter is, either one of those are fine. But I am just about ready to run here.

[Speaker 2]
What's Zianna's best proficiencies?

[Speaker 3]
Probably something in Arcana and shit, right? I'm not intelligence.

[Speaker 6]
I'm very good at persuasion.

[Speaker 3]
You're a sorcerer. I'm fucking dumb.

[Speaker 6]
I know, yeah, it's very strange that I make a lot of potions, but I'm not that good at intelligence. I've got a plus six in Arcana. It's actually not that bad.

[Speaker 2]
What about history? No, plus two.

[Speaker 6]
Arcana, plus six. Insight, plus six. Persuasion?

Hey, I could persuade the plants. Plus seven.

[Speaker 2]
Persuasion's not any of the checks for any of the rolls left. Religion? No, it's the other one.

History and nature.

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 6]
No, it's just a plus two, if it isn't.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, just roll perception or something. Something, or just an inch.

[Speaker 6]
How many hours do we need per day? I guess my intelligence is plus three, so it's slightly better than the usual. I think just try one of the inches.

No, no it isn't.

[Speaker 4]
How many hours would we be doing this stuff per day?

[Speaker 1]
Probably about four to eight.

[Speaker 6]
Actually, I was wrong. If it's not charisma, it's a plus two. Could I use Arcana in some way to gleam the magics of the land?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, that'd be perfect.

[Speaker 6]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
I guess we're like survivalists.

[Speaker 6]
Hey, I didn't roll a two, I rolled a three! Can I re-roll that with Chrono Shift?

[Speaker 3]
Really, it shouldn't be like that, eh?

[Speaker 4]
Can I re-roll that with Chrono Shift, or no?

[Speaker 3]
You should be able to, I believe.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, try again.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not as familiar with the chronogist, but it seems like...

[Speaker 4]
It's a reaction. Reaction and a... yeah.

[Speaker 1]
What is this?

[Speaker 6]
I never knew the dice got this high.

[Speaker 2]
We banished Sianna to a different timeline and got a new one.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we got the Sianna control dice. It's awesome. Maybe that's the secret.

[Speaker 5]
We just have to let her roll like twice every time.

[Speaker 1]
Already? No, that's perfect. Good stable successes.

[Speaker 2]
This process will get a bit quicker once we're familiar with how it all works.

[Speaker 1]
It takes everybody who uses it for the first time probably about an hour. And then every time after that it's like, alright. So, you folks fly across the lake here, sticking reasonably close to the borderline From your aerial perch, or aerial position rather, you can see a few different interesting sights around here.

The main one is probably the activated sun shrine to the left. Sianna was there for the set activation. It's still streaming light into the sky, unbroken.

You're high enough up in the air that you can just barely see the Rhine creeping in on the horizon. Speaking of which, I have to advance that. I've been neglecting the cross-advance.

I'm going to fix that tonight, so don't you worry.

[Speaker 3]
I could just not advance, you know?

[Speaker 1]
That would be pretty cool of it. But there is one place where it needs to... I need to clear it out because it has activated the Coral Spire.

Which is good. Okay. You're also able to see what looks like...

You keep seeing something that looks like a... Who here is in charge of perception and such? You guys are the Vanguard, right?

[Speaker 2]
I believe that was Mr. Morgan.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that is me.

[Speaker 3]
I was replying, but my mic was muted.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. So you look off to the left, and you see what looks like a small army in the water. Oh, jeez.

Riding on waterweeds and various water elementals. You see a few giant crocodiles and these little fey-looking creatures. Just kind of patrolling the waters, keeping an eye on you.

But it does look like some of them are advancing towards the... Isle of Dread over here, towards the Sun Shrine.

[Speaker 3]
I will share this information with the party. I don't know what we can do about it, but like... Now you know.

Now you are also aware.

[Speaker 2]
We have talked to like three people who have remarked about how we haven't defended any of the Sun Shrine to that date. Maybe James is trying to tell us something.

[Speaker 1]
Never. If they were bad, what might they do? How would you stop them?

You know, and advancing onwards, you guys can see the Cloud Forest. Cloud Forest is interesting because you can still see like regular trees and a little bit of regular greenery through this. And the trees that the cloud like quote-unquote leaves are attached to trees that otherwise look normal.

They just look like regular oak trees. Maybe a little bit more bluish tint, but at this distance you actually can't tell if that's just on account of the fact that it's covered by clouds and your vision is a little bit distorted looking into this place. But there's like multiple like bows and rings and like branch networks, canopies of clouds that are separate.

It's not just like one giant... It's not just one giant connected cloud that roasts through the entire land. It looks like there are gaps, but they don't touch each other much like a regular canopy might.

In Cloud Forest, there's more emphasis on forest than cloud. That's probably the best way to describe it shortly. Now you folks are going where?

The highlands? The ravines? Which area are you headed to?

The running water. Are you folks planning to have the dragons drop you off?

[Speaker 2]
Would we be able to be dropped off down through the forest? Or do we have to get dropped off outside the forest and then go on foot?

[Speaker 1]
You can get dropped off through the forest, I think.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we'll try and get around this area, I think. If someone else has a better idea, I'm happy to hear it I only have bad ideas.

[Speaker 3]
See, I have patented worse ideas.

[Speaker 2]
I think the running water takes us to what we're looking for and then we can go look for giants and steal their toenails once we've accomplished the pool goal.

[Speaker 5]
Now, are the dragons dropping us off and then flying back to the keep?

[Speaker 2]
Ah, fuck, I didn't think about that.

[Speaker 5]
Or are they dropping us off and hanging out wherever we dropped them off?

[Speaker 6]
We'll probably just explore with the dragons, right?

[Speaker 1]
You guys have an artificer with you, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, we do. One Loveland Artificer.

[Speaker 1]
Right. You would probably be able to craft a using some of, and we can flavor this as actually being one of your spells just dual purpose as part of your engaging the tracking preparing one of the mechanisms that you use to prepare your spells as a dual purpose flare. That would be sick.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Dragons back to you. That would be 100 gold?

[Speaker 1]
Based off the... yes, I believe so.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, 100 times the creature's CR. So I don't know what... probably at least 700 gold and I don't have that much.

[Speaker 1]
What's the feature that you're looking at?

[Speaker 4]
Well, we're trying to grab the dragons, the cobalt dragons' attention and the other dragons. I personally don't know of any dragons that are lower than CR 7 and it says the GP value is equal to 100 times the creature's CR therefore 700 is like a minimum estimate.

[Speaker 5]
You're just making a flare to get their attention rather than...

[Speaker 2]
Well, you can just tell the dragons, hey, look out for our flare when we're ready to leave sort of thing. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
That's not a problem then.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's okay.

[Speaker 4]
And you said 100 gold?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so personalizing can be, okay, on a successful check you can prepare a trap to incapacitate your intended target. So this wouldn't be...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I figured you were... Yeah, I...

[Speaker 1]
It was just as part of... since you did do that I figured as part of that exploration action you would be able to prepare some additional supplies as well from like a travel pack or something like that. Some of you actually do have travel packs so you could just say that you have a flare in there.

But other options...

[Speaker 4]
That works for me then.

[Speaker 1]
With materials whose GP value equals 100 times the creature's CR. So if you guys wanted to use that for one of the cloud giants... That'd be funny as hell.

Jesus. It's just a really big, like, pneumatic splinter designed to go directly into the toenail. But it sounds like some other people would have to contribute materials and you folks could decide whether or not you did that probably after our next break.

So, you guys land inside the cloud forest you go through multiple different layers of, again, cloud-like material that seems to have a consistency much like how actual different clouds in a real atmosphere have a different structure to them. So you go through like Nimbus, Cumulonimbus as you folks are going down. Until you hit the bottom and you hit this region of like what's mostly just fog.

You don't have a lot of vision. You don't have a lot of line of sight. It's generally restricted somewhere between 60 to 30 feet.

The places where it only goes out to 30 feet usually indicates that there's like an object in the mist or producing mist. But not necessarily. But you guys right now have to lay the land.

The first thing that you see when you get down there which have not noticed you they don't seem to be terribly perturbed anyways is a small herd of deer. These deer have several white spots going down their backs as well as three white stripes going from the crown of their head to their tail and two more that go on either shoulder blade to shoulder blade. Every once in a while they stand up and you see that they sniff the air and their antlers expand.

It appears as though all of them have antlers the male and female. And they expand a little bit inside the mist as they kind of like as they like raise their heads up you see them expand like a breath organ might.

[Speaker 7]
A bit wacky. Fuck, I was forgetting something.

[Speaker 3]
James, two days into my travel into our travel I needed to roll for a ley line. Well not roll for a ley line so two days into the travel I got my I encountered the next ley line which is an elemental line somewhere. If you want to draw that in.

I have an elemental tap now. Oh boy. Surely no one would use this for nefarious purposes.

[Speaker 1]
So that line is going to run between Bronloch and Ugger.

[Speaker 2]
Well what element does that relate to?

[Speaker 1]
I think it's all of them.

[Speaker 2]
Just put Bronloch on a fault line.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, so what are you folks doing?

[Speaker 1]
What would you like to look for first?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to snap my fingers. Does it make the correct sound?

[Speaker 1]
You get a pretty good snap out of it. It's a little bit humid in this place so it's a little bit hotter than normal but you're still able to do it loudly and you hear no echo.

[Speaker 4]
Gotcha. Can I also cast all of my buff spells as well? Tiny so you can find familiar Gift of Alacrity.

Not familiar.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. You just have like the two minute overlord scene.

[Speaker 3]
That was a good one.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. I've been holding that in for like two days, I swear to god.

[Speaker 3]
No, I was commenting the scene you were talking about. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
As you folks are waiting, as you folks are sitting down, you also hear a loud inhuman screech and you see a lot of the mist and fog part before you. A small herd, probably about twelve of elk. Sorry, not elk, moose start moving through the forest.

They have more of a bluish tint to their fur. Their eyes appear white and their antlers glow in this fog area. Occasionally you hear them make additional noises and every time they do the fog ports in front of them.

[Speaker 2]
Do they look Do they look like the Hide Behind?

[Speaker 1]
Do they look cryptid-ish? No, no, they look pretty standard and you guys are seasoned adventurers so you probably would have come across a quote-unquote magical biome at some point.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes when you're in a magical area like this Does this look like something I could like, make, like influence the weather on? Would this be better for us if I just like toned the weather back a shade?

[Speaker 8]
So what do you help them if you can?

[Speaker 3]
If it's someone with a frost I can't do jack shit is the problem. Yeah, why not? I've got three anyway, so I will expend my forecast later to decrement the weather in the area.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. It gets more foggy out.

[Speaker 2]
Fuck. Can I do a nature check on the scream we heard? Did it sound like a like an elk screaming sort of thing or was it like a monster scream?

[Speaker 1]
It was definitely like an elk scream.

[Speaker 2]
A little bit more like a thriller haunting but Right, okay, it's just a spooky elk it's not a cryptid.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are, like I said, being in magical biomes you guys probably would have been at least once in your lives seen a quote-unquote natural creature that's more or less adapted to the magical biome.

[Speaker 2]
Maya has seen cows that have mushrooms growing on them and they're red and white.

[Speaker 3]
And you can milk them for mushrooms. You can get shears, you can trim the mushrooms off. That's how normal cows are born.

Shave them.

[Speaker 2]
That's good. Maya's going to start searching for running water. She's going to listen and she's going to listen.

If she can't see it then she hasn't found it. So... Would that be like a perception?

[Speaker 1]
Sort of thing. Nice. You are confident that there is no running water in your immediate area.

Your immediate surroundings. After a little bit of moving around because I assume by this point you guys are doing a little bit of searching.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's probably not right next to you guys but you do hear the occasional elk scream getting further and further away.

[Speaker 5]
To expedite things a little bit, could I have my owl familiar just scout around above to see? Well, I'm not really sure if I could hear the water too well but if I could see any sources of water within the area?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they could do that. They would have to fly within. This would probably be investigation.

But you can't add proficiency to it. The only caveat is that they would have to be pretty low to the ground in Oregon.

[Speaker 5]
So I would roll off the owl's sheet, yes? Because I made a sheet for it and everything.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That's still a minus two. On investigation. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
It's fine. As long as it's as bad as Morgan at Charisma Chicks.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we don't speak about that.

[Speaker 1]
The owl goes north and it can't really seem to find anything north.

[Speaker 2]
We should just journey vaguely into the Forest Depot, I think is the best. Surely we'll stumble upon it if we wander aimlessly.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. What specific stuff are we looking?

[Speaker 2]
We've got giants. Are there like... The highlands are safe from possibly the hidebehinds.

We need to follow running water. That leads to the pools that the Ranger Wayne would find ingredients from.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, there should be a bunch of components around the pools if we can find them, but we need to find water first. I would like to look around for any animals. Just like small forest critters.

[Speaker 1]
There's the deer, there's the elk. The elk have been moving further away. They've been east.

They've been moving east. In addition to this, go ahead and make me a quick... Well, actually no, I don't know why I'm asking you for a check.

They're just around here. First up on the list is a number of squirrels whose tails are like... Their tails don't even look physical.

They just look like constant smoke. Tail-shaped smoke and bits of cloud are constantly coming off of them. So they're just like grazing the track visually because they're just constantly streaming through the fog.

[Speaker 3]
I will spend 10 minutes while everyone else is looking around and stuff. I will spend 10 minutes ritual casting speak with animals and then I'll walk up to one of the squirrels on one of the trees. Do you know where the water is around here?

If I might be so... If you'd be so kind as to help us. That's the last thing I need.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if we're done. Fuck's sake.

[Speaker 3]
I thought it was only the rats. The rats and the snakes.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, it's everything. ...off the leaves that collect in various... and of course the watery pools that just collect in the branches here.

It can be quite dangerous as I'm sure you well know to travel about on the forest floor. Do we prefer our water from higher up?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's fair enough. That's understandable enough. I'm just wondering, like, if you knew where the water was.

And if not, do you know who does travel around on the floor? Who would need to, like, drink out of a stream?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, no, I don't know anybody who needs to drink out of a stream specifically.

But I do know that the local fireflies are pretty fond of using that area for speed dating.

[Speaker 7]
And a quick meal.

[Speaker 3]
All righty then. Thank you very much. You've been a great help.

Appreciate it. You need anything? I can do you a quick favor, if you'd like.

[Speaker 7]
Well, yes.

[Speaker 1]
I've found... I've gone for many years... My family, for many years now, has been traveling near one of these streams for one of our favorite...

It's one of our favorite places to bury nuts. But there's a little bit of hard stuff in the ground now that we can't seem to dig around. And it's really been bothering us these many years.

So if you could dig it up, we'd be awfully happy. But do be warned, there are some awfully long arms around that way that like to grab you out of the trees. Oh.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
I'd say it's about a thousand paces north of the stream itself. Look for where it crooks, and you'll see a small lamppost in the middle of it.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Thank you very much. We shall...

We'll try and attend to that so you can safely go back to inhabiting that area.

[Speaker 7]
Excellent. Watch out. Careful not to poke your feet on the bones.

They're very sharp.

[Speaker 3]
All righty. I will leave and inform Maia and the rest of the party. Yeah, there's some bad shit happening a bit up north of here.

Lampposts and bones and cryptid-sounding bullshit. But it sounds like we're at least near the streams we're looking for.

[Speaker 4]
Something is better than nothing, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And if we can find the streams, we can follow it along. So my friend up there, he wants us to have a look into it.

Because it's apparently been disturbing some of the wildlife around here. So if we can do something about it, that'd be nice. At the very least, we should probably check it out while we're on that path anyway.

[Speaker 2]
Since we're in the area, we might as well. I did tell Wayne that we'd look into his father's disappearance, so it could be all connected.

[Speaker 3]
Bones in the ground, a weird lamppost that's bent, and long arms coming from the trees. Sounds like whatever he was describing. Freaky and unnatural.

[Speaker 2]
We should keep searching for the river, then.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. I'm gonna go ask the deer. I'm gonna go ask the deer.

[Speaker 1]
At about this point, it is mid-afternoon. Is anybody else in the party looking to do anything? Prepare?

Search? I know there's some tiny servants around, I know folks are... If you have anything to improvise, you could also ask me that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I was hoping... You can go.

[Speaker 5]
No, you can go.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Yeah, I was hoping to take a look around as well. A metaphorical look around, I want to take a smell around more accurately.

How would you like me to do that? With my... Like, all of my servants, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Go ahead and make me a 10-ball. With advantage.

And that'll help cut down on procedure time.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Okay. I still have the highest modifier.

Second, while we're timed.

[Speaker 1]
What are your tiny servants made out of, by the way?

[Speaker 4]
They're little metal drones that fly around. They're controlled by the metal ball I play with. Same with my familiar and other things, they're just different variants.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Let's see here. There was somebody else who wanted to ask a question as well.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I was just going to have my owl go around again. If that's okay? I don't know if it's been enough time and I don't want to double up on a check.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, I think it'll be fun.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'll just do it really quick so I don't take up time. You said investigation, right?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 5]
You know... Oh, I'll just roll again then.

[Speaker 1]
You cleared out an area, and you guys have a... That's one better!

[Speaker 2]
It's still an 8, though.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you have also confirmed that as far as you and the owl are concerned, there is also no water to the west.

[Speaker 5]
To the west, you said?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. So you've cleared out north and west. Uh...

I will soon have something. Uh, Zianna, did you... Did you fish, forage, or hunt?

[Speaker 6]
Uh... I guess forage would be the closest thing. I did an arcana check, so...

I guess foraging for, like, magical herbs and stuff would be, like, what...

[Speaker 7]
Alright, perfect.

[Speaker 1]
So while you're in this area, while you're looking around, you find a plant that looks like a bunch of gas sacks. Sprouting from a flower. You find, at first, a really big version of one.

Like, big enough, like, the blooms are big enough. Um... They almost look big enough to hold a person.

Um... And then you find several smaller varieties. You're able to add at least three of the smaller versions to your inventory.

[Speaker 6]
What should I write them down as, just...

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see here. I have a... Uh, you write them down as balloon bellflowers.

Alright, and then Landy said that they were going to be back in ten minutes. So if you folks want to take, like, a five-minute break, feel free to do so. And then I'm going to get to Melania's action.

Because she's going to discover the... She's going to discover running water.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
And we're back.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, again.

[Speaker 1]
Bless you.

[Speaker 5]
Bless you.

[Speaker 1]
I just misspelled something.

[Speaker 4]
You misspelled something?

[Speaker 1]
I did spell something. Badly. Or rather, I failed at spelling something.

Oh. I have a paper tablet here that I write most of the notes on.

[Speaker 5]
It's fine, though? It's safe?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're just erasing the start of it. It's fine.

[Speaker 5]
That's fair.

[Speaker 2]
I am back. Did I miss anything?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. We took a short break. Is everybody back?

Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I never left.

[Speaker 3]
There's no fucking way they're starting a lawnmower out the front again. You've been mowing all morning. I'll be...

[Speaker 1]
Amazing.

[Speaker 4]
Lovely.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so the first thing that happens is that several of Melania's... Let me close this tab. Several of Melania's drones have returned back, each carrying something different.

One of them is carrying a wisp, which on closer inspection looks to be kind of... It looks like a... It looks like a mix between a dragonfly and firefly.

It has that big, fancy carcass on top. The... What are they called?

Oh, god. Elytra, I think is the name for the shell wings.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Elytra?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I think it's the name for the shell wings that don't actually flap themselves, but are like the top carapace.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, like the Minecraft item.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I think that's what it's called. Um... I literally think that is the Latin name for what...

and what it's named after, but it has those four really extended wings that spread out from underneath. But in place of a head, there is just a small little ball of light, and there is a smaller, secondary ball of light that sometimes flashes at the rear of the insect. The second drone...

Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
To clarify, I hear water spilling, right?

[Speaker 1]
Rather, the drones are returning the signs of water. Got it, okay.

[Speaker 3]
The dragonflies and all that will be the direction.

[Speaker 1]
It's trying to... because right now it's trying to escape and pull in a specific direction. The second drone comes back with a small, basically, cup fashioned out of a leaf.

Got it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. How many cons does it have to roll if I drink out of it?

[Speaker 1]
One way to find out. Well, you wouldn't know until you actually drink it, that's true.

[Speaker 4]
I'll feed it to somebody with higher con.

[Speaker 3]
My cons are not even that high, it's my health that's ridiculous. As a bear. As a bear.

I think it's the same.

[Speaker 1]
The bear evaporates and you can no longer turn into it, ever. Aww, my bear.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, all the bears have the same con as me.

[Speaker 2]
We are just a bear, man.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Can we go in the direction of the one that got the firefly?

[Speaker 1]
Wasn't there a third drone? There was. Yeah.

The third drone is not carrying anything with it, but you see a small, crystalline looking mushroom jumping after the drone. And it's just like, it's building up a lot of momentum with every single bounce. It doesn't have legs or anything, it's just like really rubbery as it bounces along the forest floor.

And it's just following the drone. It comes to a stop, which is a little bit difficult for it, it shoots up way higher than it was previously jumping, and then each jump afterwards carries it down slightly further and further until it's just bouncing around your knees.

[Speaker 4]
So I got a little slime pad. I'll just head back, take my drones and head back to the group, inform them of what I found, and ask, do any of you want to drink this water?

[Speaker 2]
How good does the water look, James?

[Speaker 1]
It looks like smart water. It looks great.

[Speaker 5]
I'll drink it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll give her the little plant cup.

[Speaker 5]
I will grab onto the plant cup and drink the liquid without hesitation.

[Speaker 1]
It's the best water you've ever tasted. Oh hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That water is really fucking tasty. Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh hell yeah, and fucking Morgan just wades into it. I haven't found the water yet. I'm on my way then.

I'm on my way.

[Speaker 8]
Good.

[Speaker 1]
More water.

[Speaker 4]
So, what I'll do is I'll fill in everybody and what was found, and then... Which one do you want to head to first?

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 2]
They all came from different directions, your drones?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Follow the Firefly one to the lake?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so they all came from a relatively similar direction. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay, my bad. The Firefly should just go directly back, probably. Use the lake as a guide.

[Speaker 4]
We can also follow the drones.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, I guess they did go there.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. So the drones start leading you pretty much in the same direction as the Firefly. The Firefly takes a few more detours.

[Speaker 4]
As we go, can I start ritual casting Phantom Steed for myself?

[Speaker 1]
If you wanted to do that before you got... So I don't think you could do it on the move. But if you wanted to do that before you folks actually set out, you would have had plenty of time for it.

[Speaker 3]
As in...? While we were scrolling around, I ritual cast... While we were just in the clearing, I ritual casted Speak with Animals while everyone was just standing around, so you would have had time then.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I know, but I can sit on the steed and continue casting, right? Or no?

[Speaker 1]
Are you ritual casting...? I don't think you can move while you're ritual casting.

[Speaker 4]
I don't believe there's actually any rules on moving while ritual casting.

[Speaker 1]
Right.

[Speaker 4]
It just says you have to use your action to continue casting for any spells that have a duration longer than, say, an action or bonus action. And that doesn't preclude movement.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright. That'll work nicely then.

So while you're moving along, you'll be casting Find Steed, just kind of weaving...

[Speaker 8]
A phantom steed, but yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Weaving clown stuff into it.

[Speaker 4]
I was thinking more of a tank, but yes. A tank that dies in one hit.

[Speaker 2]
The only thing I can find... The only thing I can find is if your concentration gets broken, so we'll just avoid that happening.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I always assumed that you couldn't move while you were doing that, but I think that's just... It's just like an artifact from my real life table back in South Jersey.

[Speaker 3]
I think it's also like a lot of people's mental scape of things. If they imagine someone doing a ritual of any sort, they're like sitting down, fucking drawing some shit in the floor.

[Speaker 1]
At least I imagine it like that. Especially if it's something like Alarm. I would guess that I probably would need to stay near where I was actually casting Alarm.

[Speaker 2]
Teleportation circle.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, probably that one.

[Speaker 2]
Teleportation line, as I've moved.

[Speaker 3]
As I walk. As I'm just going on a stroll for the full duration. I've left the circle in pieces going through town.

[Speaker 6]
It's as if you teleported to the place. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly.

[Speaker 6]
I can also cast up to...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I can also potentially keep up to 5 of these going at a time if I basically non-stop cast Ritual Cast Phantom Steed. So if any of you guys want steeds...

[Speaker 5]
I would like a steed.

[Speaker 3]
How long does the steed last for?

[Speaker 4]
One hour each. Each one takes 10 minutes in an action to cast, so...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, jeez.

[Speaker 4]
I can keep 5 going maximum at a time.

[Speaker 2]
How fast is the steed?

[Speaker 4]
It's a warhorse, so 60 feet and it dies in one hit. Except it's weird how it says it dies. Some people say it dies over the course of a minute, gradually fading away, but...

Who knows? I figured I'd wait for it to get hit before asking.

[Speaker 2]
How easy is it to navigate a horse through the forest?

[Speaker 1]
You guys are following a trail, and once you actually get to the stream, which takes you about an hour, it becomes distinctly easier. The Phantom Steed, I believe, has something of a... It's not quite like a fly speed, but I think it hovers above the ground, right?

[Speaker 4]
As far as I know, it's just a warhorse that I summon as a Ritual. Sorry, a riding horse. Yeah, nothing else.

A speed of 100 feet can travel 10 miles an hour at 13 miles at a fast pace. And Yoru can also, I believe she also does have Phantom Steed. And she can also Ritual Cast, which means you can have up to 5 horses, or 10 horses at a time.

[Speaker 2]
It's a large horse, and we could probably just double up on horses as well. They're a large creature.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, those are small, so she doesn't need her own horse. You could have a horse anyway, you see.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you guys are moving along. Eventually, within about an hour, horsed or unhorsed, you folks come across with my S-Pengo. Okay, there we go.

We're good. We're good. We're safe.

You're what? S-Peng. It's my...

It comes off my Galaxy S23.

[Speaker 4]
I thought you said something else, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have the Ultra? Do you have the S23 Ultra?

[Speaker 2]
Does that have the S-Peng? I'm so jealous. I miss the Galaxy Notes.

[Speaker 1]
It's a lot of fun, and it's my first upgrade since the S8, so... Jesus Christ. She crushed it.

She saddled me. Okay, so, as you folks go along, you come across the stream, or rather creek. It's fairly easy to take your horses through.

They just kind of plop on through like they don't really lose their balance or anything. And they're phantom steeds, so they don't get the normal horse nervousness at bodies of water that they don't know the exact depth of. As you folks go along, you come across a large eddy, or stone, in the center of the creek, and you all start hearing whispers.

[Speaker 5]
And we understand the whispers.

[Speaker 1]
Make me a perception check. Sorry, let me say that again. Make me an intelligence statement, bro.

[Speaker 8]
All of us? No.

[Speaker 1]
I think just the people listening.

[Speaker 2]
That's my favorite kind of perception.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I would definitely be listening for this kind of stuff, since we're blind. Is this magical?

[Speaker 1]
It is.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I've got advantage, then.

[Speaker 1]
At least I think it is. It might be something else.

[Speaker 4]
Frick, a 16.

[Speaker 1]
All right, let's see here. Success, success, success.

[Speaker 2]
Is this for everyone, James, or just the people listening? This is just for the people listening.

[Speaker 3]
Good thing Morgan doesn't listen.

[Speaker 2]
Why is she self-absorbed to notice?

[Speaker 1]
Changes.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I think that worked. Yes, it did. Okay, so we're going to activate this.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. Where are we dropping our tokens?

[Speaker 1]
That would be on the left side.

[Speaker 5]
Left?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Left. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And everybody, who wants a phantom steed? Just me?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I would gladly. Yes, I'll take one.

If they are free.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I currently have none.

[Speaker 3]
Four. That's an interesting token. Hold up, my one looks like this.

[Speaker 5]
That's one of the default ones. Whoa, nice.

[Speaker 4]
I'm enjoying all these phantom steeds we have.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. It all has steeds.

[Speaker 5]
I can just imagine it being here.

[Speaker 3]
How the frick do people rotate these things? I just- Shift. Yeah, shift or control.

It's either, either or. Learning. Shift is way faster.

Why is shift so much faster, what?

[Speaker 2]
Why is one of them faster than the other in the first place? Shift only does the eight axes.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, yep yep yep. X-I.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think you'll find it's pronounced X-I's.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have any pictures of horses to use, yes.

[Speaker 3]
How dare you invoke the holy name of Core here.

[Speaker 6]
I can't. A giant elk is speaking.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so. The, uh... There's Melania, Pera, and...

And I. Okay. So play, brothers.

So, Melani- Pera is the only one that actually recognizes this voice. It sounds like Jaster.

[Speaker 7]
And he's saying, Just over and over and over and over.

[Speaker 1]
Melania and then I in the meantime, You just hear, Alright.

[Speaker 7]
They'll leave you too. They're going to leave you too. They'll leave you behind.

You'll never leave this forest.

[Speaker 3]
Now call me paranoid, but this sounds like cryptid talk to me.

[Speaker 8]
Honestly, I'm not listening.

[Speaker 3]
Morgan's never listening.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna refresh because the map has not loaded for me yet.

[Speaker 2]
Rip, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I've been blessed with horse.

[Speaker 2]
Real horse.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, who wanted a horse?

[Speaker 3]
I'll take a horse. One more for me. Okay, and you can...

[Speaker 2]
Do not have a horse. No!

[Speaker 6]
Do you want a compendium?

[Speaker 2]
A compendium? Sorry, I'm losing my mind. In the compendium packs, there's monsters.

If you search horse, there's just the tokens there.

[Speaker 3]
You can import one of them to yourself.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I've been doing.

[Speaker 3]
That's why I have such incredible things such as this.

[Speaker 4]
I do prefer a token, though, because it makes it clear where I can be at any time.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, that's fair.

[Speaker 4]
Am I on the map, or... I don't see myself. I think I see you.

You're under this griffon thing.

[Speaker 2]
That's me.

[Speaker 4]
Rick, I am.

[Speaker 2]
Paris.

[Speaker 3]
Is this you? Yeah, that's Zianna. Paris the curled.

[Speaker 1]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Morgan, if you give yourself a height of one foot, you can be on top of the horse.

[Speaker 1]
For some reason, the horse takes priority. I recommend editing your token settings in your actual character sheet. Oh, really?

[Speaker 4]
You can do that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if you edit your character sheet's token, just go to actor tabs, double-click on your character. It'll bring up your character sheet. If you go from there to token, those are your default settings for any time that you drag your token out onto the...

[Speaker 4]
Gotcha. How do you make it taller, though? Or, you know, float in the air?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think you can. I'm looking through it.

[Speaker 5]
They have an elevation. Oh, really? Yeah, it says elevation of feet.

Then you can set it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Where is this?

[Speaker 5]
Do you want me to set your elevation or something?

[Speaker 1]
Morgan's is already set.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I just added it manually then. It's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... You folks are going along. The other party members, you can still hear the whispers, but you're not listening.

You start getting really... Just the sense that something is watching you, folks. Channels start flitting behind different trees.

[Speaker 2]
Fine, I'll listen to the whispering.

[Speaker 3]
I will also be listening to the whispering, having everyone else who's ready for it, too. Yes! And it's not that much better.

[Speaker 2]
To be fair, Jaster, he deserved it.

[Speaker 1]
We've done it. So that's Maya, Emily...

[Speaker 5]
And didn't you already roll a save for this? Or are we re-rolling saves? Oh, I thought we had to re-roll.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, you don't have to re-roll. Myself and Maya hadn't rolled yet because we weren't listening, but we have to listen now!

[Speaker 5]
I'll delete this, just to... I'm standing.

[Speaker 2]
That's not good. You'll have to see that.

[Speaker 3]
Or you can do the Chad thing.

[Speaker 1]
Roll an 8. Rolling an 8. Okay, Maya...

I think it's just Maya, Morgan, and... Let's see here.

[Speaker 2]
I love insanity.

[Speaker 1]
Cyana, I need you to make me a wisdom saving throw. In the meantime, Maya and Morgan, you two are stunned. Maya, Morgan, and...

Cyana, you are protected. Is this a magical stun, from what I can tell?

[Speaker 5]
Or would I have to do an Arcana for that?

[Speaker 1]
Or is that just not how it works? You can do either an Arcana or a Medicine check.

[Speaker 5]
Would I be able to do this immediately, or is this too late, by the way? To check on them?

[Speaker 1]
That's totally fine.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll do an Arcana then. 16.

[Speaker 8]
I could kill him! He turned up!

[Speaker 3]
Even when he's not here, he's here! Look! This time I'll make sure the dragon fucking swallows you.

I ain't taking any chances this time.

[Speaker 1]
That's right, I was taking no chances. Okay, so... Let's see here.

Para, I think is the only one that's seen this right now. I'm going to get to Ana in just a second. Para, as you look up, riding along your horse there, there's a brief moment of panic.

Morgan and Maya have both kind of just frozen up and fallen off their horses. Ana runs over to check on them. You look up for a moment, and you see what looks like Yaster.

He's pretty recognizable, Yaster. Except he looks just like completely black. He looks inky.

Like the light around him is just being sucked in. And you can see like these little flecks of starlight on him. Honestly?

Say again?

[Speaker 3]
I was going to say, honestly, that's probably normal.

[Speaker 1]
He probably just does that. He phases in and out of a proper illusion of Yaster and this inky starlight. In the meantime, Ana, you go over to check on...

Let's see here. You go over and check on Morgan and Maya. You tell them this is likely a magically induced, or supernaturally induced, effect of seeing or hearing something that normal people generally shouldn't.

As you go over, you can see that they're actually bleeding a little bit from the ears.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. Can I do a narcotic to see if I can use the spell magic on this stuff?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Here we go.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
So, two things are going to happen. First is a bunch of worms that are like pale, glowing and ethereal, are going to crawl out of Morgan and Maya's ears. That's also probably normal.

Far more than the ear canal could actually hold. They look too big to actually fit inside the ears.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's awful.

[Speaker 4]
Can I touch one? Okay, wait. Quick clarification on a...

Sorry, blanking on the name. The secondary class I took that specializes in doing scrolls.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's timely.

[Speaker 4]
For feature... Let me put it in chat. Lasting a number of rounds, does it have a minimum of...

Does it last the beginning of my next turn or the end of my next turn?

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 4]
If I roll a one? The scroll. So if I create a scroll with one scholar dice, does it last long enough for me to use it without action surging or anything?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. So it will probably be until the end of your next turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then I'm going to use one of those.

[Speaker 1]
That should just be a free action to make the scroll.

[Speaker 6]
You can create it and use it in the same turn.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm dumb. You're right.

[Speaker 6]
I can't read.

[Speaker 4]
My bad.

[Speaker 2]
I don't have it in front of me, so you're fine. A lot of the dice expending stuff is just a free action. I know.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I just can't read. Y'all are known to your son. You are greeted by the sight of Yaster.

Standing on top of the rocks here.

[Speaker 3]
This bastard, what is he doing here?

[Speaker 2]
I didn't invite you. How'd you get here?

[Speaker 1]
You get to hear a little voice breeze next to your ears while you stand up.

[Speaker 3]
Do we see the worms? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
What the... Yuck.

[Speaker 4]
That's why you should shower.

[Speaker 3]
I shower? I showered last week. Don't lump me in with that oath.

Or was it last month? It was sometime around then. Whenever I was last near a lake.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the second thing I want everybody to do is roll initiative.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take pleasure in gutting you, boy. I killed Yaster, honey. I needed this.

Appreciate it, James. Thank you, James.

[Speaker 4]
I've got a 25.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to rip him apart quite literally.

[Speaker 4]
Can I edit the initiative in any way?

[Speaker 3]
You'll have to get James to do that.

[Speaker 4]
I have a 25 for initiative instead of 20.

[Speaker 2]
I have a 24 because of alacrity.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Melania has 25 and I have 24.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sorry. I should have said.

[Speaker 6]
No, it's okay. I'm not in the combat track.

[Speaker 3]
You can add yourself with the thingy. With the sword and shield, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I can't see.

[Speaker 3]
Oh shit, I would have got my lead ice back.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, there we go. I'm stupid.

[Speaker 1]
That's a lair action. Okay, so that is relevant. Did somebody else have access to...

Let's see here. It was just Ana with alacrity, right?

[Speaker 5]
Melania had alacrity as well.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so I think you said it's 25 and 24? Yeah, I have a 24.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sorry. We should have said something that's on us.

[Speaker 5]
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
First off with the 25, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 4]
Just to clarify, I'm not supposed to see any enemy?

[Speaker 3]
Or is this supposed to be an enemy? That is an enemy. If you ever see that token, kill it.

Especially if he walks into wherever we are claiming this is his house, and that it was always his house. He's lying. It's my house.

I have the key, and kill him.

[Speaker 4]
Gotcha. Okay, so what I'm going to do is... You see, it would be smart for me to just drop a concentration spell straight off.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to take a selfie with his corpse and send it to his hirelings. They'll appreciate it.

[Speaker 4]
The rule is I can't cast a spell at all if I cast even a cantrip as a bonus action, right?

[Speaker 3]
No, you can't cast two leveled spells at a time.

[Speaker 6]
Right, cantrip. You can do a cantrip and a leveled spell. You can't do two leveled spells.

[Speaker 3]
I think action search lets you do two leveled spells.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
I can't cast a cantrip with a bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
It's hardcoded into the rules of spellcasting that you can't cast more than one leveled spell in a turn, I'm pretty sure.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's if you cast a spell with a bonus action, then you can't cast a leveled spell at all for the rest of your turn. Yeah. You can do two cantrips, yes.

Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop a hypnotic pattern on this guy. No, I'm going to actually mind weapon. So that is...

Int save.

[Speaker 2]
If only Jasta had a brain.

[Speaker 4]
After that, bonus action, command my little tiny servants to pick up any rocks I throw down and to follow me. Stay behind me. As I...

[Speaker 1]
First thing I'm going to have you do is click on that saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
Hang on a minute.

[Speaker 1]
If you succeed on this...

[Speaker 4]
Is this a save against magic, or is this just a...

[Speaker 1]
This is, yeah, because it's against your own mind weapon.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, what I'm going to do is... I'm going to chronergy that. Chronal shift, that's my reaction.

Go bye bye. Yes, yes. And I make another save.

[Speaker 5]
Fuck, okay. Would I be able to silvery the barbstone?

[Speaker 4]
No, because it's only on a success.

[Speaker 3]
You can only force enemies to reroll stuff.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. Yeah, so... And take hand...

So I take... Does anything happen to me, or is it reflected at me?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you're going to be... Basically, it's going to get reflected back at you.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I take 3d6 damage, and then I also... On its next turn, so I'm still good here, and it also doesn't affect any of my familiars, because it's targeting me. Therefore, I can still move.

My familiars move whenever they move. When do my familiars move, by the way?

[Speaker 1]
On your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Let me get my...

[Speaker 1]
And then all of these...

[Speaker 3]
Is it supposed to be a reflection, James, or like a bounce back? So does Jasta still get affected, or...

[Speaker 1]
It's like a reflect... It's like the scene in fucking Harry Potter, where they're dueling with wands, and the two spells collide, and if one of them reaches the other person, then they get fucked.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So yeah, it is very much alike. If the owner gets it back on them, then he doesn't have to do shit.

[Speaker 4]
Am I okay to move over here? Don't ask the rules. With my horse, and then my familiars and such dash.

My owl doesn't have to dash, but yes.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. Alright, and then...

[Speaker 4]
Nothing moves. And I'm going to have my familiar run up to his face and take help action for whoever attacks the guy next.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good.

[Speaker 4]
And I'll move all my tokens.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so I have...

[Speaker 5]
Whoa. I was going to try to CC him, but... With what I just saw, and since I have arcane knowledge, I think I'd be able to tell what happened for the most part.

So I'm just going to Eldritch Blast his ass.

[Speaker 3]
Wait a minute. Hold on just a second. Huh?

James. Yo. You fucked us.

That's not 30 feet. You bastard. Wait, what is in 30 feet?

The ability you pinged if an enemy within 30 feet makes you make a save.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. The castle's not in 30 feet. Tasha's mindwave has a 90 foot range.

Has a 90 foot range.

[Speaker 4]
I was going from back here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Then I'll give myself the...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. And I still have my reaction. And, okay, screw that, silvery barbs.

Yes, yes.

[Speaker 3]
What the fuck, Jack? You're supposed to be the smart one that picks up on shit like that. You're making my tired ass do it.

I only roll the way I want it to have detriment.

[Speaker 2]
That's true.

[Speaker 3]
That's true.

[Speaker 2]
Shit.

[Speaker 1]
I would have been doing this from back here. I don't think this invokes magical resistance. I think he just has to roll once.

[Speaker 4]
That depends on what magical resistance.

[Speaker 1]
Well, magical resistance normally lets you roll twice, but I think this only lets them roll another d20, which, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Die!

[Speaker 1]
He never rolls like this in session, by the way.

[Speaker 4]
Yuru, Yuru, help, Yuru, help, help, help, help. Make him roll again, please.

[Speaker 5]
Silvery barbs.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, and I'm giving advantage to... I think this is Maya.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Hey!

[Speaker 4]
Yes! Finally!

[Speaker 5]
I'm giving advantage to Sianna. With my silvery barbs. Easy.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Alright, so he's going to take... Oh, my mouse died.

Freak!

[Speaker 5]
It's okay, I get to put my mouse back.

[Speaker 1]
And then...

[Speaker 2]
You can tell the last one was a Jasta roll because it had no modifiers applied to the roll. I just clicked on the little d20 thing. Okay.

That's the Jasta we know.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so they take the damage, and I. You were rolling Eldritch Blast, as I recall.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, well, I was going to CC him originally because... I'm just going to do that now. So I'm going to...

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
He has to make a dc17.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'm just going to fail. This is an aberration.

[Speaker 5]
No! Freak! Oh!

Oh, well that's my bad. Then I'm going to quicken spell. My Eldritch Blast.

[Speaker 3]
Pretend I have the satisfaction of killing him now. Two beams.

[Speaker 4]
You can't do that.

[Speaker 3]
It's a tragedy all around.

[Speaker 4]
What? You can't do that because if you cast a spell as a bonus action, any spell, including non-leveled spells, you can't cast any other spells.

[Speaker 6]
You can do it the other way. If you quicken spell hold person.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Then you can cast it. It's very finicky, but...

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I love how the Sage of... I love the clarifications they released. Made it infinitely more complex than the already...

Like, complicated understanding that we have there.

[Speaker 6]
It honestly should just be, like, one leveled spell per turn.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Bonus actions, however you feel like.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, there's this complicated bonus action. What the fuck?

[Speaker 3]
Needed to be as unintuitive as possible. Go fuck yourself. I preferred when I didn't know the rules and I just let people cast Finger of Death twice because they were sorcerers.

That was pretty cool. They just go blam, blam! I think Jack got to do that, actually.

Was it Kyari that just Finger of Death quickened Finger of Death? No. I think you had Metamagic from some...

No, that was...

[Speaker 2]
You let Alex do that to a Kraken, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that was the same fight that I... Knocked Morby out of the air.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Let's see here, what was the... Ana, I'm going to click on the attack rolls if that's okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sure, I wasn't sure if I was still doing that.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 1]
Well, this is going to be a hit.

[Speaker 5]
Eight damage.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It looks really...

[Speaker 5]
You can do eight plus five. Ooh.

[Speaker 4]
Should be another five as well. That's what you have. I can only see...

Because I don't think I did that correctly.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I did not add it correctly. Seven damage.

[Speaker 2]
Here's a fifteen for your purposes, Jane.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry. It's okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's all good. Here is an eight for also your purposes. I'm just going to put...

I wonder what that number's doing there, floating in midair.

[Speaker 2]
Justice player by Matsu literally can't roll with any modifiers added or anything. It's so much effort. I don't know how he...

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what he's... What demonic magic he's done to his character sheet to make it the worst thing possible.

[Speaker 5]
I have been so tempted to just be like...

[Speaker 1]
Monsters. I don't know why. I think something's just screwed.

Okay, so the Ultra Splash looks really effective. We're going to move on to a lair action. Oh my goodness.

Let's see here. I got the worms out of my ears. Too bad.

Alright, so any horses within ten feet of Maya or Morgan are going to disappear.

[Speaker 8]
I should have known.

[Speaker 1]
I should have known. It's just Alani has left, I think. Alright, I need you folks to make me, anybody who's caught in that radius, to make me a PC-16 intelligence saving throw.

[Speaker 5]
Do I have to make it twice because I'm layered over or is it just once?

[Speaker 1]
I think twice.

[Speaker 3]
No! No! Nice!

You can't invade a mine until it's empty, baby! Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, sorry, Bob's works for this.

[Speaker 5]
Is Anai in the radius?

[Speaker 2]
Anai is not.

[Speaker 1]
The horse was.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, okay, okay, I got confused because... Oh, nice! I'll delete mine.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so those of you who failed, take 20 psychic damage. Those of you who succeeded, take half. What was the DC, sorry?

It was a 40. PC-16! Fuck.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I knew I should have.

[Speaker 2]
You just killed him. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, how much damage was that?

[Speaker 7]
20 on fail. 20 on fail, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, okay, okay. So most of us take like 20, okay, yeah. I'll do it quick.

That's fine.

[Speaker 1]
And then, Maya, you were on deck.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, I'm just going to start doing my stuff now.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm. Alright, I will quicken spell if I can find... There it is.

Mass Cure Wounds, just hitting us five... Um... That's not with the modifier.

It should be 13 total.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, no, it's already got the plus three in there, if you open it up. It does? It rolled a seven.

You rolled a four, a one, and a two.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, no, it's just, it's just, yeah, absolute doo-doo. We all get 10 health!

[Speaker 3]
I was only missing 10, this is perfect.

[Speaker 6]
Aha! All a part of my plan. Then I'll shoot some Eldritch Blasters.

[Speaker 1]
Also hits.

[Speaker 6]
Nine total.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that deals eight.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, one of those had advantage. From self-rebarbs.

[Speaker 6]
I had to use it on my saving throw. It has to be the next thing you do. Yeah, the next attack, ability check, or saving throw.

Which benedict are my familiar?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, benedict are my familiar, though.

[Speaker 1]
Get the benefits of health back.

[Speaker 2]
Maya also had self-rebarbs, it would have been on the... Nope, no crit.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Is that going to be your turn, Xiana? Yup.

Alrighty. Go ahead, Maya, start beating them.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, um... Our bonus action is Shadow Step to where she is. She'll then toss a kunai.

Has advantage because of the Shadow Step. What is Jasta wielding?

[Speaker 1]
Any weapons? His normal gear? He's got a rapier in one hand and a volley crossbow in the other.

Fucker.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I would have sneak attack. Nineteen off the first.

Uh, she'll toss another one and then step back. Fifteen hit him.

[Speaker 1]
Fifteen misses. But he's empty! Easy.

Okay. Uh, he is going to... You see this, uh, inky light kind of sink into a ball?

And you sink it almost into, like, a hole in the air. It's where it makes it light and dark and it just streams into it. Forming an inky ball thereafter.

Uh, you guys know what's possible already. I need everybody to make me a dexterity saving throw. This is versus magic.

Is this just a spell you said? Uh, it is versus magic. It's not a spell.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Some of you have magic resistance.

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 1]
I'm paranoid.

[Speaker 5]
I'm kind of stupid. Was I inside that?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, that's how you get everyone out of it.

[Speaker 1]
Including familiars and... Well, actually, your drones aren't... Are your drones on the board?

Got it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, they're, like, on top of the horse. I told them to be behind me, technically.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that's gonna count.

[Speaker 4]
Somewhere over there.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, they might not have to make a saving throw. This is going to be thirty damage on a fail, uh, fifteen damage on a success.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. The owl would be out of this thing. Out of the what?

The owl's high enough up that it would be out of the range. There you go. And keep Pythagoras.

[Speaker 5]
That's a lot of damage. Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
There, you can use that for... Any self-purposes. Alright!

Uh, behind is a... Left behind, once this thing detonates, is a small bottle that appears to be filled with smoke.

[Speaker 2]
Like, Jaster detonated? He's gone and there's just a bottle?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Is combat over?

[Speaker 1]
Combat is over!

[Speaker 2]
What's in the bottle? My arcade lets me get the loot first. What have I got?

I don't have Arcana. Can I investigate the bottle? There is my check if that's allowed.

[Speaker 1]
18? Uh, looks magical.

[Speaker 4]
I do have Identify if you want me to take a look.

[Speaker 2]
Please do. I have no clue what this is. My SS holding it up.

I wish I got to attack Jaster more.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, and then I'll sit down and cast Ritual Cast Identify.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It is an ever-smoking bottle.

[Speaker 4]
I'll tell everybody else that, though, of course. Is it Stopper, by the way?

[Speaker 1]
It is.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Why did it choose Jaster, of all things, to impersonate?

[Speaker 3]
Sorta weird.

[Speaker 2]
I was going to go for something scary in our minds. I would have picked a pit fiend. Not him.

This is strange. We should keep moving.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, make our way into the water.

[Speaker 5]
Did he die and we just didn't realize it?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I'm sure he'll show up his house in a little bit. Bastard.

[Speaker 1]
In the Items tab, I have configured ownership for... Make sure that's the case. For a Discovered Items tab.

And I'm going to start importing stuff into there.

[Speaker 2]
Do I need to deworm my ears still?

[Speaker 1]
No, they're out there. Still just kind of hanging out on the ground there.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to quickly just stomp them out. Disgusting.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder what that little button that says Show Players does. Because it doesn't appear to be anything.

[Speaker 5]
It'll send it to us. It'll just take over our screen, usually.

[Speaker 3]
This one's for Para. Yeah, that made it. And this one is for Anai.

[Speaker 1]
I still have no idea why ownership doesn't stick on Foundry.

[Speaker 3]
13 there, 12 there. Are you damaged? Are you damaged badly?

Melania or...

[Speaker 6]
My healing?

[Speaker 4]
I'll survive, I still have half my health.

[Speaker 3]
You're good, you're good. You're not, okay.

[Speaker 4]
I have half health. No, it's okay, it's okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's too late. The spell slots are already on here.

[Speaker 4]
That's an entire spell slot. I do not use them, trust me.

[Speaker 3]
I do not use them. You will see.

[Speaker 4]
I figured I could tell from what's been going on so far. I'll also summon my tiny servants back. I'll start ritual casting again as we go.

Also, this time I'll make sure to have magic stones on hand so I don't have to keep casting them.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, so we won't get to the river quickly. Everyone hop on. How many people can you carry?

It's a large creature, so up to James is just... It'd be like most of us, I feel.

[Speaker 6]
I can sit on my flying carpet and fly.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you have a flying carpet, so we don't need to carry... I don't remember. I'm a monk.

You're fast. You can probably just carry the other three. Pretty handily, I would imagine.

This is a huge creature.

[Speaker 4]
I am still going to cast my own steed.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just so we can travel while you're casting the steed and then you can ride your own horse. Because this lasts like two hours.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, two hours. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
So, you folks are going to move along. Following, going around the large eddy, traveling through the creek bed. The wisp line that you guys have been looking at speeds off.

And you guys can see more lights up ahead. Sorry, you see one light in particular going up first. Wait, is there more light?

Pause it. No, I was right the first time. Goddammit.

And in my notes. You do see what appears to be several lights off in the mist. As you get closer, as the wisp line gets closer, you can see it is a lamp.

It is structured a little bit like a chandelier. It has one central light in the center that's just kind of like a glowing ball, a glowing orb. And then it has seven arranged around it.

[Speaker 2]
Identify. That could be the one the squirrel mentioned.

[Speaker 1]
It is a continual flame. Or it is under the effects of a continual flame spell.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. How long does it take us to get there, by the way?

[Speaker 1]
Probably about another half hour.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so I do have my speed.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you kind of almost have it. It's also enchanted to damage creatures who eat it. Or attempt to eat it.

[Speaker 4]
Got it. I'll pass that knowledge on to everybody else.

[Speaker 1]
So don't eat the lamp. Uh, yes. Everybody looks at Morgan.

All for no prejudicial reasons.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want to take it? I can mage hand it off, if that would be helpful. Do we need it?

I want it.

[Speaker 6]
If you'd like to take it, I guess you could, but... Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then I'll use mage hand and pick it up from a safe distance in case it explodes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the mage hand just kind of fades against it. I don't think that... Got it.

When I say lamp, I meant lamp post. Oh!

[Speaker 4]
Okay, never...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, I'm not taking that. I hate a lamp post.

[Speaker 1]
It just hit me, I'm like, what? I'm really trying to pick it up with the mage...

[Speaker 2]
I assume it's like the Narnia.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It's the... If the Narnia lamp was made by us.

[Speaker 2]
Elves, you say? Some filigree and... Well...

We're looking for these nuts then.

[Speaker 3]
This is where the bad shit is. Oh, actually, what am I doing? Merf.

Whatever sound an elk makes. Fuck. Shit.

Who has ever...

[Speaker 4]
I wonder what Morgan's saying right now.

[Speaker 3]
Maya has it. Morgan's complaining about the fucking lawnmower out the front that's still going. I'm gonna lose my mind.

It's still going. I'm gonna fucking lose it.

[Speaker 1]
You still have guns in Australia, right?

[Speaker 3]
No, we don't! They took them away!

[Speaker 1]
No, we've got guns. That's why you can't let them take it.

[Speaker 6]
We've got .22s, rimfires.

[Speaker 3]
I've got a .22 fucking like 30 minutes out of town in my fucking grandfather's safe.

[Speaker 1]
That's my gun. If you need to go get it.

[Speaker 3]
I can't just whip out the Glock.

[Speaker 1]
Shame.

[Speaker 3]
A gadget concealed carry.

[Speaker 4]
How about we give the bottle to a familiar that way we can use it without expending one of our actions.

[Speaker 3]
That's a decent idea.

[Speaker 4]
Currently, I think yours, familiar, is only mine. No, it has to be yours since mine got murdered in the explosion.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds good. Tape a bottle to it now.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have anything else to do with the lamppost. I'm not gonna try and pick it up again.

[Speaker 2]
I forget exactly where the squirrel said the nuts were buried. Was it here?

[Speaker 3]
It's closer to the river, I believe, but it's somewhere around here, yeah. I'm also forgetting the exact specifics about it. It was just south of the lamppost, right, James?

It's between the lamppost and the river. The river should be about a thousand...

[Speaker 8]
I'm locking it in.

[Speaker 3]
It should be somewhere... There's bones in the ground somewhere near the lamppost. There's also the hands coming out of the trees to grab you somewhere near the lamppost.

The river was a thousand paces south of the lamppost, roughly. Those are also squirrel paces, I imagine, so...

[Speaker 2]
Was it one thousand paces north of the lamp, or the...

[Speaker 3]
So the lamp was one thousand paces north of the river. Of the stream.

[Speaker 1]
That's, like, observably not the case. The lamp is in the crook of the stream. Yeah, this is, like, squirrel paces, though.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, could it...

[Speaker 1]
No, I mean, like, it's not north of the stream. The lamppost itself is not north of the stream. The lamppost is in the middle of the stream.

[Speaker 2]
Do you think there's...

[Speaker 3]
So maybe there's another lamppost a thousand paces north of here, and that's where he was talking about.

[Speaker 2]
I think he... I don't think there's another lamppost. I think that is just where they're talking about.

Maya's gonna head towards that direction and look for these stupid nuts and bones. Can I roll, like, survival or investigation to do that? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
First, I need to know who else is going with you, and what is your marching order?

[Speaker 3]
I am a little bit behind with whoever's still riding on me. Yeah, I'll follow behind as well.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I would go with a casting... I'd go with two casting detect magic as we go.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, cool. I can float, like, sort of above.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, organize ourselves up here. So we got Maya at the front. And we got the Elks just behind.

Oops. What are we doing, like, right to left, or...? Yeah, right to left, so right is the front.

[Speaker 6]
I'll float, like, above the Elk.

[Speaker 3]
Don't worry about this Morgan token, he's just gonna hang out over there. I need him to add to initiative. Easy.

I will activate my... Actually, Morgan's gonna go hang out with Jester, so I can slit his throat given any provocations.

[Speaker 2]
I'll activate my x-ray vision lenses and look through the ground. It's just dirt, then it should be... How far does it go?

30 feet radius, and it lasts for a minute, so I'm pretty quick. I can cover some good ground. And, yeah, I doubt they're digging more than 3 feet deep to bury their nuts.

I sure hope they aren't. Mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
So, you move along, you're moving pretty quickly. You think you see a skeletal structure behind one of the cloud trees next to you for, like, a brief moment. And it just kind of lifts up and exits your radius.

If you continue moving along, you don't see anything really of import for a hot second, but then you start seeing, like, little arrowheads and broken fletching and what appears to be a intact bow and intact hunting knife beneath the earth. This is about 50 paces out from the uh, 50 paces out from the lamppost.

[Speaker 2]
I am going to tell the others that there are weapons and discarded ammunition in the ground. Be on your guard.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's very sweet. Wow.

[Speaker 6]
Do we have a description of the ranger's father that got missing, or say what weapon he would use?

[Speaker 3]
We'll just see a random dude, I'm sure we can just ask.

[Speaker 6]
What if they're dead, though?

[Speaker 3]
Is that probably worse than whatever the fuckin' weird arm thing's got to him? That sounds much worse.

[Speaker 1]
After another 25 paces, you see a you start seeing the outskirts of, with the X-Ray vision, you start seeing the outskirts of a circle made of bones, extremely neatly placed. It looks like a bird's nest, except it's geometric, it's nearly like a mandala, or fractal in terms of how well all the bones have been placed and organized. And there are a lot of bones.

Well, that's probably what he's talking about. There is a section of dirt in the middle of it.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, why must have they put the nut there?

[Speaker 3]
I was set out of character, too, because I'm still an elk, and I forgot. Just elkin' along.

[Speaker 1]
Did you want to turn into the elk that you saw earlier? No.

[Speaker 3]
I wanted to turn into the biggest elk. I needed to be a huge, I am a giant elk, so that I could carry, like, three people.

[Speaker 2]
Anyone want to volunteer?

[Speaker 3]
Actually, how would you rule it? Like, can I just turn into things that are bigger? For, like, a better stat block?

Is that allowed? Like, for, like, flavor-wise? James?

I need you to reword that question. I'm not exactly sure what you mean. So, for example, like, would I be able to turn into the elk I saw earlier, but at the giant elk size?

[Speaker 1]
So I don't think that you would be able to. Unless you saw a giant elk variety of it, I don't think that you would be able to.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay. So that already answers my question about turning into dinosaurs by just making lizards bigger.

[Speaker 1]
Well, no. Dinosaurs are...

[Speaker 3]
Dinosaurs exist here. But I'd actually have to see one instead of, oh, well, I saw a pretty scary looking, like, lizard, but it was, like, a foot tall. But when I'm, like, high-level, I can use, like, the Tyrannosaurus stat block.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes. I will note that... I'd have to actually see one.

Yes. Instead of I would upscale... You did...

I think you specifically did see one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I did.

[Speaker 1]
I'm aware. But there are, yeah, there are other...

[Speaker 3]
4d12 bite attack bastards.

[Speaker 1]
There are dinosaurs around the valley. One other thing to note is that you're in a pretty good position to actually do so if you ever get the... What is it?

The dire line? Yes, I can make things dire.

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm. What?

[Speaker 3]
One of the ley lines is a dire line and you... You said every creature in the area.

[Speaker 1]
Animals and dire animals exist.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, some of the ley lines just make everything on that line dire. But sometimes they make it dire, but small line.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, see, look, it's like a ley line, but it's dire. So, yeah, it's a 50-50 chance as to whether or not that makes it dire, or it turns into one of those tiny animals from Spy Kids 2. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Well, no, no, no, no, that's the resonance. I can resonance to make them smaller. The line itself always turns them into dire creatures.

[Speaker 1]
But I can resonance them into the little ones if I would like. Perfect. Okay, so, Mai, you have not actually approached the center of the nest as yet, correct?

No. That's scary.

[Speaker 6]
Couldn't Mage Hand be enough to, like, dig up the area? What about two Mage Hands? What about...

What about a tiny servant? What about a tiny servant and two Mage Hands?

[Speaker 1]
A tiny servant has strength of four, by the way. If you want to make, like, a little tiny servant that, like, drills into the earth... A little shovel servant?

Yeah. The lemming.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'll do some tinkering, then, like, change the ball here and a few slivers of metal fall off, and attach themselves to the servant, making a little drill thingy, then.

[Speaker 1]
In the distance, you hear, like, a whoop sound, and you hear a branch smack against a tree, but nothing else happens. The tiny servant goes over, starts drilling into the earth, does so pretty effectively, goes down and... What's that?

[Speaker 4]
Does it matter where on the map it is?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that's fine. Just know that they're 30 feet ahead of Morgan. Or, sorry, 30 feet ahead of Maya.

Yeah. Or, I guess, more than 30 feet. Probably 45 feet away.

And that'll just be a reference. So they start digging down, and then you hear what sounds like a drill breaking or coming against something that's too... It's almost like the sound of a jackhammer when it hits something that's too hard for it.

It's like, alright, it's going, it's going, it's going, and then, like, a clinking sound that indicates it's sort of rebounding.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll bring that to the attention of everybody else and say that supposedly didn't work.

[Speaker 2]
Fine, I'll check it out.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe have somebody teleport in?

[Speaker 5]
Let's see. Let me... Um...

Do I want to do Death Ward? Or do I want to buff you?

[Speaker 4]
The tiny serpent didn't die as it flew over, so...

[Speaker 6]
Hold on, let me just detect guidance.

[Speaker 2]
I'm already casting my magic.

[Speaker 1]
X-ray vision will have faded by this point.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, yeah, I was expecting that. That's fine. With guidance, I will go up to the death trap.

I mean, not the bone circle. Not a death trap. Watts, come into contact with the trail, looking down.

[Speaker 1]
Looking down, you see a little bit of earth. It's differently colored. It's moving a little bit.

It's almost like swimming in a second layer that's like a mix of fast-flowing separatory rock.

[Speaker 2]
Kill it with fire. This must be what the squirrels were talking about when they said they couldn't get their nuts back. I am not trained in Arcana, so I don't know what this means.

I'm trained in nature. Can I do a nature check?

[Speaker 7]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
How do I stop the magic?

[Speaker 1]
It's not... It's definitely not natural. Good enough for me.

Can I do an Arcana check? Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Seems safe. Enough.

[Speaker 1]
For now. Okay. You have heard of a spell like this that produces an effect like this.

It's called Forlorn Insistment, where it carries a creature deep beneath the earth. indicating its position, or to indicate its position for later retrieval if somebody wants such a thing. It's normally a kind of...

And also, Ni and... Milani will be aware of this from the Glassblowers Academy, because they have their own variant of this. To indicate its position for later retrieval if somebody wants, it creates a little bit of a hard barrier of earth not too far beneath the ground.

[Speaker 6]
How deep does it pull the body?

[Speaker 7]
Very deep. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Want me to try and dispel?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Like, pull it out?

[Speaker 2]
If it's dispelled, will it just leave whatever's dragged down at the bottom?

[Speaker 1]
Or will it return it to the surface? Tiziana's understanding that usually reverses the effects of the spell. I'll pop him out.

That'd be great.

[Speaker 4]
Then I'll go up, finish casting the attack of magic at some point, or is that not happening now?

[Speaker 1]
Oops, sorry. I misused the detail. The caster chooses whether or not the spell magic will recover them if it's dispelled by somebody else.

Sorry, if it's not, the caster can choose to reverse it by casting the spell again, but as far as whether or not other people can reverse it is up to the caster. They set it as a glyph of warning.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, never mind then.

[Speaker 1]
But you can do it if they set it as such. We could just dig the full way down.

[Speaker 6]
I have stone shape. I've got the stone wand. So the shape would be...

I could make a small passage 5 feet down. 40 feet total. Deep.

[Speaker 3]
As long as it's straight.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to catch you up. They found a spell, or signs of somebody.

[Speaker 3]
I have been here and listening. It's every time I think to speak I have to remind myself I can't right now because I'm an elk. Oh no, Otter had a...

Okay. Otter's restarting. I am still here.

My cat has been exiled to the other room as she's eating.

[Speaker 4]
Stone shape could be helpful.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think stone shape's the way to go.

[Speaker 6]
How far is far down? Is that more than 40 feet?

[Speaker 1]
There's only one way to find that out. There's a few different ways to find that out. I want everybody to make me a perception check.

[Speaker 4]
How many? Can I make one with each of my summons?

[Speaker 1]
Frick.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Fine.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Who has the lowest tier?

[Speaker 5]
Maya within Maya.

[Speaker 8]
Yay!

[Speaker 5]
It automatically connected me. Interesting. I have no idea how he turned my computer off because the button's really hard to push on a good day.

I actually have to really push down on that button. I do not know how he did that.

[Speaker 3]
Conversely, my button's really easy to press and it's on the top of the computer so every time the cat's just fucking around and stands on top of the computer I'm just like, oh, this is the end.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, Maya, now that Hera's back, pretty much everybody's keeping a pretty good lookout for the most part, you know, keeping aware, keeping alert. Maya, you look to your side and you think you see what, like, a long furred arm that is, that has, you see no sign of anything that it's connected to is how ridiculously long this is. Just kind of hang down from a tree next to you and look as if it's about to scoop Sienna up.

At the moment you turn to it, it disappears.

[Speaker 2]
They're getting crypted. Did anyone else see that? Sorry, what?

[Speaker 3]
Did we? The elk snorts. Never mind.

[Speaker 6]
I'll go. Which one is it? Not wall of stone.

I'm safe. Diggy diggy hole.

[Speaker 1]
I am. My brother's singing with me. Oh, don't go.

Alrighty, so you shape it, what is it, 40 feet down?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, yeah, using all of the charges of the wand I can do a tunnel 40 feet down.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you still do not see anything, but the whatchamacallit, does the sign that this thing is buried here does go further down.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. It still hasn't been dispelled, has it?

[Speaker 4]
Do you want it to?

[Speaker 2]
I think we'd try.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then I'm gonna create a scroll of, well, I'm gonna try to create a scroll of dispel magic by expending two scholar dyes. That should give me an average roll of a 7. Okay, then I'm gonna use the scroll, cast dispel magic, then expend another scholar dye to keep the scroll around for future use for two hours.

[Speaker 7]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, the um, let's see, roll this, I need you to make me a dispel magic roll. Okay, I think is just plus your intelligence modifier? Oh!

That gets it.

[Speaker 6]
Unless it's like, 12th level. Level 500.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Zianna, real quick, I need you to describe to me what the stone shape was exactly. Are there any additional details to your stone shape, or is it just a 40 foot rock?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I can just like, pretty much void the rock 5 feet down every time I cast it. So it is pretty much just like a cylindrical tube down 40 feet.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, what's the range of dispel magic? It's like 60 feet, right?

Touch.

[Speaker 4]
I'm pretty sure it's... No, it's 120 feet, my bad. I don't know why I thought it was touch.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you guys see a body appear at the bottom of the hole. Oh!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, look at that! Does it resemble the ranger guy from earlier?

[Speaker 1]
Skeletal ones? Right, yeah. And it's getting dark.

Oh, I can...

[Speaker 3]
Yes!

[Speaker 4]
Yes! I can send my drones down before anybody goes down.

[Speaker 2]
And they carry the body out?

[Speaker 4]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I have three of them.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to get the body.

[Speaker 4]
They can carry 180 tons.

[Speaker 2]
Utilizing my spider climb, I will walk down the hole. And if the body doesn't move as I approach, I will drag it out of the hole.

[Speaker 1]
It's just breathing right now. Staring upward. It's mostly rags.

There's some cracked leather armor.

[Speaker 2]
Come on, buddy. Let's get you out of here. That's lifting them up.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then you bring them out of the hole.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, Para, can you tell me what's wrong with them?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Utilize your big medicine brain.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Para will go and check. Do you want me to roll medicine?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 5]
Weep. Weep. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. You can surmise that this appears to be like, the breathing is fine. The levels appear to be fine.

No sign, other than a lot of dust and dirt. Like, they look filthy. Uh, just covered in dirt and such.

But otherwise, no sign that this person was under the ground for any extended period of time that would normally kill somebody. Is this man lucid? You're able to conclude that he's probably in some kind of state of psychological shock.

[Speaker 2]
Just sit him on the elk. We can get to that later. I think that solves the not problem and the missing father problem.

Looking at this man now, does he look like Wayne?

[Speaker 1]
I think it's probably too dirty to tell. Uh, but based on context, I will not blame you for that conclusion.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, anyone have Prestidigitation?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I can Prestidigitate the dirt away.

[Speaker 2]
Give this man a sponge bath.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll cast Prestidigitation as many times as it takes.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Looks like he kind of like twitches a little bit with some of the dirt being washed away, but otherwise, yeah, it does kind of look like Wayne.

[Speaker 8]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Slightly more saggy features, blue eyes instead of brown, and what was probably darker hair. Now gone thoroughly gray. Whereas Wayne had a salt and pepper look.

[Speaker 4]
I'll hand them over to Maya. She seems to know better about this stuff than I do.

[Speaker 2]
I have no clue, but if we sit him on the elf, we can now finish what we're here for and then get out. So if anyone has any opposition to that, we can keep looking for we can follow the river.

[Speaker 4]
We're also here for cloud giants.

[Speaker 2]
If we do find them, I'm happy to try and take one on, but as far as his giving me the HIVs.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, eat easily. Looking back in the direction that you guys thought the lamp post was, you guys can't actually see any light coming from that region.

[Speaker 4]
Do we hear any running water?

[Speaker 1]
If you listen carefully, yes.

[Speaker 2]
If I snap my fingers, what does it sound like?

[Speaker 1]
It's getting a little bit harder. You guys are definitely traveling downwards. It doesn't echo as if you're in a ravine, but it is pretty difficult to snap.

[Speaker 4]
It's not too late to turn around now, is it?

[Speaker 2]
We could just take this as a win and maybe come back once we fix this man's psychological condition.

[Speaker 4]
We can carry him around. I've got tiny discs. Floating discs.

A little metal contraption with tank treads. It's a ritual cast as well. It carries 500 pounds, even if nobody wants to carry him.

[Speaker 2]
That would be handy. However, if we're leaving now, we can just get the dragons to carry him.

[Speaker 5]
Are we planning on heading back to Bronloch now?

[Speaker 2]
At least if we're going to stop somewhere, I don't think we should stay in the forest for the evening.

[Speaker 5]
Because if we're just going to head back to Bronloch, I could always just teleport him out.

[Speaker 3]
That probably works best. Oh, we took dragons here, didn't we?

[Speaker 2]
The dragons are nearby.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. We just go back to the dragons and teleport out.

[Speaker 2]
That wouldn't target everything. Or did you say just the man we sent? Or would someone go with him?

[Speaker 4]
Um... I did want...

[Speaker 5]
Out of character, I did want to do some actual combat. Yeah, we can just send him through.

[Speaker 2]
Um... That's at will. You can do that one, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Just send him to Tiara's keep. Someone will pick him up eventually.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet.

[Speaker 5]
Let's send him out. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Let's keep going.

[Speaker 2]
Here now, we might as well push on a little bit further. Let's follow the running water. The sound of running water.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. You guys go a little bit further back towards the water. What is the light situation of the party right now?

[Speaker 5]
Um... I have light as a cantrip. I also have darkvision.

Um... I can cast... I do not have it prepared.

Never mind.

[Speaker 6]
I can cast darkvision.

[Speaker 3]
I can't see until I untransform. Oh. I'll cast darkvision on the elk then.

Well, I'd only lost two hours, and we've been doing this for a bit now, so I don't know when it's gonna run out.

[Speaker 4]
The drones have blind sight 60 feet, if that matters.

[Speaker 1]
It does.

[Speaker 8]
Pog.

[Speaker 1]
Are the drones with... Go ahead and set up your marching order again.

[Speaker 4]
Is it right to left again, or... Is it left to right this time?

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, it's half my druid level. No, I'm like this for three hours.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. You can front line, please. I don't want to get eaten.

Oh, it's terrifying.

[Speaker 6]
I know, yeah. I'll be in between the, um... elk.

[Speaker 3]
Behind the elk, I will lead. Alright. Elk can lead.

Elk and John.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. As you are... moving along, the elk's in the front.

Cool, cool, cool. The drones, which is funny, because it can't really see at the moment. Well, actually, no, it has that light on.

As we're moving along, the drones freeze up for a minute. Or not literally for a minute, but they start beeping and whirring. Chirping back and forth, kind of like a scared R2D2.

And you guys can see in front of you, you can actually see the outline of what maybe is the lamppost. Like, you can see the light of the lamppost, but it looks darkened. As if something is, like, standing between you and it.

Like, you can only see... You vaguely see there's something in the mist that's being outlined by the light.

[Speaker 4]
What does it look like?

[Speaker 1]
It kind of looks like... It just looks like a tree. Except the form isn't quite right.

Um... There's a section of the trunk that's, like, thinner towards the bottom that you can actually see. And then it thickens right around probably about the 20 foot height is when it actually thickens.

And then it gets a little bit thicker afterwards. And then past that there's the lamppost. The light doesn't actually reach that far.

So it looks like, I don't know, a Comcast remote.

[Speaker 4]
What do you guys feel like we should do?

[Speaker 2]
We could blow it up. The only placement called Weathergear Fireball to be used.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, is it a little chilly right now?

[Speaker 3]
Better unpack the grenade. Every camping trip should take a grenade.

[Speaker 4]
I always pack multiple.

[Speaker 3]
What do you folks do?

[Speaker 4]
Smart.

[Speaker 6]
Do we...

[Speaker 4]
We can just attack it.

[Speaker 6]
Do we just... Is it in the way or is it in between the way we came from?

[Speaker 1]
All right, and I just cast the fireball.

[Speaker 3]
We've done it. We have Fireball. It's beautiful.

[Speaker 8]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
I can't wait for, like, as the fire goes off it just illuminates the forest and we see dozens of creatures around us. The classic.

[Speaker 7]
That would be awful.

[Speaker 4]
If that does happen, I'm ditching you guys.

[Speaker 1]
So, the fireball illuminates the area. Briefly casts a bunch of the mysticide from the concussive force. You see dun-brown fur and hairless feet and hands attached to...

You don't even... attached to what is, like, the beginnings of a torso. It is so high up.

It was standing at a... It was standing at a... One of the hands reaches up and you can hear something shaking.

Just barely, though. Not nearly enough weight or noise for a creature of this size. And one hand, it just pulls itself out of the way of the fireball.

Oh, I hate that.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Oh, I hate whatever this is.

[Speaker 2]
Do you still want that combat? No.

[Speaker 4]
I wouldn't say no out of curiosity. It only has 19 saves.

[Speaker 6]
And can, like, actually ignore fully succeed and not take damage. It should be fine.

[Speaker 2]
As long as you get evasion at, like, 8th level or whatever.

[Speaker 1]
By the way, the fifth stool that's been following you guys around has calmed down a little bit. It froze up probably about the same time as the droids did. Now it's back to hopping around.

Perfect. It's trying to lead you guys down the... It's trying to lead you guys down the stream.

[Speaker 4]
The street?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, stream. The creek?

[Speaker 4]
Oh. I'm down to follow.

[Speaker 2]
That is where we need to go.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Let's follow the... thing.

[Speaker 1]
You guys followed it a little bit further. It takes probably about a half an hour but as you move along there are a lot more... Anxiety starts to leave your bones a little bit.

The fireflies or these... or wispflies keep passing by you folks and just calmly float along. You see, like, literal streams of them going along until the area gets brighter and brighter and brighter.

The lower fog is pretty much removed and the canopy at this point looks like a... Looks like a night sky that's being illuminated by spotlights. Like a cloudy overcast sky that's being illuminated by spotlights.

Almost like the... Like the light of cities if you've ever seen the light of a city bounce off an overcast sky. Or like a stormy sky at night.

Except it's much, much closer. It's like this cotton blanket that's roiling and moving above you guys, illuminated by all these fireflies. And the lower fog again is more or less dispersed.

There's a lot more regular green vegetation around. Something is blue. The herbalists are free to make me a...

It's just only 1d8. Herbs. Anna, you're going to find 5 herbs here.

Pera, you're going to find 1.

[Speaker 5]
How does the kind of herbs work again? Do I have to roll for that?

[Speaker 1]
You're going to roll 2d6 on your table.

[Speaker 5]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
And then everything... Those are the ones you guys just find laying on your path.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Would this be like the end of the day's travel? Yes. Because I would find another leyline at the end of today.

Synchronicity.

[Speaker 5]
Did you say 5 herbs?

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, right.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. You're fine.

[Speaker 3]
I found a forecast line at the end of today then. Interesting. I will also get a forecast conveniently having just used one.

[Speaker 1]
You folks come across a... You folks come across a pond. It's...

Realistically, it's pretty large. It's peaceful. It's distinctly well-lit.

There's a bunch of small glowing rocks and stones kind of lighting up the shoreline and the underside of the shallows of this pond. You can see bioluminescent fish occasionally coming up and snapping at the wisp lights. You have arrived at your destination.

[Speaker 4]
So here we're looking for ingredients for potions, right? Yes. So...

Do we all want to roll a check and see what we find, or...? I can just roll an arcana.

[Speaker 5]
See if I find any shimmering magical plants or fish or something. Cool.

[Speaker 4]
Cool. Yeah, let's do that. Can I give her guidance?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you could use that here.

[Speaker 8]
Okay, I'll throw her guidance.

[Speaker 5]
19.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, traveling along the shore bank, you find a small foal that looks to have drowned in the water somewhat recently. The tail is squiggly. Yeah, there's a little bit of white cloud stuff still streaming off of it.

And it also has an air pouch, a really prominent air pouch, around the throat. As you look around, you can see two more nearby, which are using their pouches to float across the water. They look rather concerned because they're floating directly towards you.

They don't appear to be able to control their direction. So we'd like you to add a cloud, which is called a... Let me type in the chat.

Whoa.

[Speaker 5]
Cloud. Oh. Okay.

Uh, just... Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. What is everybody else doing?

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I was a bit out of it for a second.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine. I'm going to ask everybody what they're doing at the moment. We're not going to roll checks just yet.

I just want to get a feel for where everybody is.

[Speaker 3]
The elk is going to wait until everyone has hopped off and lay down. Morgan, useful as always.

[Speaker 4]
Very useful. I'd be looking for the ingredients.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll look around for those. How close up to my three hours am I getting, actually, James?

[Speaker 1]
You've still got time. Remember, this comes down to short rest.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. I'm going to start having a short rest in my elk form. In fact, that's a good idea.

And because I found a ley line today, that would mean we're on a line, right? Yes. That means that I can fucking actually use my ley dice for once to help checks.

As long as people are doing checks near Morgan, I can dump all of my ley dice onto literally any check while we're on the ley line.

[Speaker 7]
Nice. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And if you need rope. Okay, so Sianna and Melania are also looking for ingredients. What are Pera and...

Maya was fishing, yeah. Maya's fishing. And Pera...

[Speaker 5]
Pera's also going to look around for some herbs and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Those of you who are herbalists, you can add your... we'll say to the quantity of items that you find.

And if you would like to collect the other two living flower bowls that have now come towards you, you can.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'll just set it to three in my inventory. Okay.

Actually, wait, no. I'll just have, like, two alive, then one.

[Speaker 1]
I'll just have set as dead just for organization. Totally fine. Okay.

Melania and Pera, I want you folks to run through the downtime action for herb collection. Maya, I also want you to run through the downtime action for fishing. Easy.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Herb, herb, where is it? That's hiring. Natural acquisitions, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Melania, do you have access to that document? Or you should have access to that document. I don't know if you're familiar with it.

Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I've looked through it a few times. Just having trouble accessing it for some reason.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want me to lead you through the checks?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that would probably be fastest.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect.

[Speaker 5]
Which section is it?

[Speaker 1]
That's in downtime. So, if you go into the pin posts in character creation, there's dropbox. One of the dropbox files is in downtime actions.

Oh, gotcha. I have it.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Maya. You are getting some dice.

[Speaker 2]
How many actions am I allowed to do for my fishing, James? I have rolled all four but I can remove.

[Speaker 1]
You've rolled all four but what?

[Speaker 2]
How many of the stages do I get to attempt?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, all four. This is a bit of a rich area.

[Speaker 3]
So, Maya, on your 16, here is a 10. Thanks, boss. And on your 13, here is a 20.

Thank you, boss. Those are my barbarian laid ice. You are welcome.

That way I don't have to remember that I, oh, how many barbarian, how many druid, no, it's just like ICBA, you have all of the barbarian ones are gone. I only have druid ones left.

[Speaker 1]
Every time? Okay, so as you guys look at Morgan's elk form, a bunch of small critters have taken to also streaming up to him and just laying next to him, like the smoke squirrels are currently sitting on his, they're currently sitting along his snout. Several exotic birds, mostly parrots, a couple of toucan species, once again adapted to this particular environment, have taken to flooding on his antlers.

Several of them have dropped feathers that you guys can collect. I'd say you could probably collect about three. How many d12s did you roll?

Three. Three, you know what? Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

[Speaker 3]
We're on a ley line, finally. I rolled really short. Wow, you rolled those detours like booty cheeks, James.

[Speaker 8]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 3]
I rolled eight, ten, and twelve for my three. You rolled one, three, and four.

[Speaker 1]
The dice give it.

[Speaker 3]
No, I'm happy to take that. I'll put down the bird feathers. I'll collect them.

[Speaker 1]
Every time that Morgan assists you with ley dice, you see a little bit of neon green or teal energy just pour some of its... neon green or teal energy just pour out of one of the points on his antlers and just flow towards you. It hits the ground and speeds up towards you like a straight geometric line.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just going to put down eight rare bird feathers in my harvesting and assume that's going to be enough. You're going to know what to do with that later, James. Excellent.

I've got those written down now. And if anyone else needs more help with checks, then I'm here to help.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm going to do mine now.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Let's fix these up. On the ten, let's...

Alright, your ten goes to an eighteen, and the seven... Yeah, we'll use three, just in case. And your seven goes to a twenty-four.

Well, no wonder you guys had so much fun with your secondary classes when I'm... When you can actually use the dice for checks. I'm going to live large while I'm on a ley line.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And then, Melania, what we're going to have you do is...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll do it. And I can do other things. I just have a few questions first.

Okay, so can I have my drones give me advantage with help action?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, and can I guidance these checks?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay. Would I be able to help with bless?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Bless doesn't apply to... It applies to attack rolls and saving throws only.

[Speaker 7]
Oh. Sorry, no.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, you want an emboldening bond for that.

[Speaker 5]
I will remember that, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
It's okay. Okay, so perception... Rick, I meant to roll the advantage.

I'm dumb. So that's a 15 plus that, so 16. And then three nature checks.

And then roll. Okay, so then that is 26, a 26, and another 26.

[Speaker 3]
Also, that 15 is a 25.

[Speaker 4]
Is it too late? To chronoshift the 15?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, do you want to?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm gonna take a long rest in a bit anyway. And I have one left anyway, so.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll roll again then.

[Speaker 1]
It was about to be four 26es.

[Speaker 4]
21.

[Speaker 1]
There, so 31.

[Speaker 4]
And then I'll add...

[Speaker 3]
And then I'll add... Oh, do you get to re-roll the guidance as well?

[Speaker 4]
No, just the original. And then I'm also gonna add my own scholar dice if I can convince you that this is the result of an intelligence check made to solve a problem or figure something out. If you read the forging...

Sorry?

[Speaker 1]
I might be inclined to do it in other cases, but you've already beat pretty much all the DCs that are active for this place by a lot.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, but I want to go higher. I know! A number needs to be bigger!

Actually, if a number was bigger, it would be slower.

[Speaker 1]
I just want to caution you. Because remember, time does pass between sessions, but those dice go back slowly. Yeah, that'll be okay then.

Okay, so what's gonna happen is you guys are going to... We're gonna handle the exact ingredients afterwards, probably. I'm gonna move on to events, but what's going to happen is Maia, Pera, and...

Let's see here. We got Maia, Pera, Danai... Zianna, did you...

You got yours, right? Or did you do your same one?

[Speaker 6]
I don't think I have.

[Speaker 3]
I still got laid ice. Go crazy.

[Speaker 1]
So so far, Maia, Pera, and Danai are going to get three rolls on the magical table of peace.

[Speaker 6]
Which roll do I need to make?

[Speaker 1]
What are you doing? Yeah, were you doing the foraging? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And the foraging was what, perception of three natures?

[Speaker 1]
You can do this. So foraging is canvassing, which is usually perception or survival, then usually history or nature, usually nature or sleight of hand, and usually nature or survival. And that's on the downtime actions in natural acquisitions.

And I just put that in the chat, because what's going to happen is while you guys are doing it, while you guys are doing this, while Maia is fishing, is that everybody for what you're doing? I think it's everybody, right? We got Pera, we got Sianna's about to do hers, Danai did hers, Wani did hers, I did hers.

Cool, cool, cool. So while Maia is fishing, you see a little bit of a ripple appear in the water. You see like a feminine humanoid, vaguely humanoid form.

Kind of split up near the surface. Just take a look at you, go back down. And then while you're continuing to fish, you kind of see that form pop up closer and closer and closer.

Just for a moment, just look at you.

[Speaker 2]
Just staring at it as I'm fishing.

[Speaker 1]
Hi. It appears in the reeds nearby, just kind of parting a few of them, just watching. When you say hi to it, it like smiles shyly and then like recedes a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
It's okay. You can come out.

[Speaker 1]
She whispers, hi.

[Speaker 2]
What was that? Sorry, I didn't hear it. Hi.

[Speaker 1]
She like looks back and forth to each side before she says it again.

[Speaker 7]
Who are you? Oh, I'm the guardian of this small lake.

[Speaker 2]
Do we need your permission to be here?

[Speaker 7]
I mean, I did let you in. Or I led you here rather. With the wishflies.

I sent them to find you.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for that. That was very helpful.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, you've done a good service. I see you have a friend there I have not seen in some time.

[Speaker 1]
Who are you referring to? She points to the fellow currently on either a floating disc or the elk.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we sent him home with a teleport.

[Speaker 1]
Y'all did not give me a confirmation of that.

[Speaker 2]
I did not take a teleport test. Fine.

[Speaker 1]
Teleport requires that you go with him.

[Speaker 2]
He's not an object.

[Speaker 1]
He's alive.

[Speaker 3]
Unlucky.

[Speaker 2]
Send a snail with him. Oh no, the caster has to go with him. He'd still be with us on the elk.

Thank you, Morgan. You are welcome. Yeah, I think we met his son.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I have not seen him in a long time either. No, he and I never met. But him on the elk there and I, we did.

[Speaker 2]
Something's wrong with the man. We found him buried, but he still seems alive. Do you know how to fix his mind?

[Speaker 7]
I think I could. I'm worried that he will be... He looks...

He looks shocked. But I think I could bring him out of it. I'm worried that he might...

No, I think I can do it. I will work magic.

[Speaker 2]
That would be good.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so she creeps up further to the shoreline. Go ahead and make me a perception check. You didn't notice the beard before, but no.

No, you don't see anything. Alright, so you bring the guy over? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That's Jim Morgan to bring the dude over. I ain't just snorx at you. You can come get him yourself.

I ain't moving. I got birds on me, antlers and shit. I ain't disturbing them.

I will very slowly hobble the man over.

[Speaker 2]
I have nine strength.

[Speaker 3]
So does Morgan.

[Speaker 2]
Fucker.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. Technically, Morgan has nine strength. These gauntlets of ogre power or the fact that I'm an elk at the moment mean nothing.

I'm sure those just...

[Speaker 2]
I'm not going to complain because she had Morgan help with the fishing. So I will slowly get the man over to this guardian.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you drag him through the pebble beach here. She takes him into his arms. He's sort of half-floating in the water.

She kisses him on the cheek and then the forehead. You see these little green and blue fairy lights emanate from her shoulders then run down in ribbons over her biceps and then her forearms and then her hands and out through her fingers and over his body. And he blinks a few times takes a deep breath closes his eyes and then opens them again.

He's like, Whew. Okay. He's looking at you, Maya.

He's like, Hello. He starts taking notice of the other people around the camp. Giant elk.

Four other people. A bunch of mechanical drones.

[Speaker 2]
We found you asleep nearby.

[Speaker 7]
Are you okay?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
I didn't think I would live through that.

[Speaker 2]
Through what exactly?

[Speaker 7]
Well, I got um You know, it's funny.

[Speaker 1]
My son and he kind of like pauses for a moment and you see the ribbons of light still going over him pulse and then he continues to just go, My son said he saw something behind the trees. I didn't really pay any attention. And then I felt like I got grabbed.

[Speaker 7]
Just kind of like taken through the forest. I was through a dumped in a circle of bones. And I was just beginning to see something on me.

I'm a pretty quick thinker, so I cast a spell on myself. Old trick I learned from a thief. In the hopes that somebody would find me later.

Looked like it worked out pretty well.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, the squirrels. You interrupted their food supply.

[Speaker 7]
Quite lucky. Damn, alrighty. Well, if it's squirrels that found me.

How many days has it been exactly? I am not sure. Well, that's fine.

We all lose track of time in here. A few folks need help getting back to the back to the edge of the forest.

[Speaker 1]
He looks back for a second, interrupting it. He's like, oh my god, you're here. Sweetheart, how long has it been?

And she's smiling. The mermaid is smiling at him. Since 40 years.

Jesus. You see the light pulse again? He's like, oh, that's a while.

[Speaker 2]
Does this mermaid look like Wayne?

[Speaker 1]
Does a mermaid look like me? Yes. There's something of a family resemblance.

Specifically the hair. I see. Has that lighter red color that he clearly didn't get from his father.

[Speaker 2]
I think your son would like to see you, so we have our own means. We rode dragons in the forest. If you would like to accompany us back to your son's, or possibly your house even, then we'd be happy to take you.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that would be nice. I'd like to spend a little extra time with my wife here, but I'll come back pretty soon. She goes, alright, my love.

Do it through the feed, but this time I have prepared a gift for you. It was intended to fix this. I actually made a second one.

[Speaker 1]
It's been so long. She starts crying saltwater tears. She dives back into the water briefly and brings out two globes.

[Speaker 7]
She goes, these, if you take them through the cloud forest, the hidebehinds won't take you. They are drift globes. Oh noice.

[Speaker 2]
We encountered something odd. Why did we find a bottle of smoke inside it when it dispersed?

[Speaker 7]
Ah, that. That's complicated. Oh dear.

When someone has died, even if they've been resuscitated, sometimes a little shadow of them is left behind. And those shadows tend to sink to places like this.

[Speaker 3]
So that was from when Chester died the first time. But not the last time.

[Speaker 2]
I think Jesse mentioned something of Chester dying. So, a bit scary.

[Speaker 7]
Mmhmm. I would be wary of them. If they've taken note of you, it's usually not for the best.

[Speaker 2]
If we leave the forest, will we be safe?

[Speaker 7]
It won't follow you. They don't have a will. So they don't have a will of their own.

They have to be commanded by something. That's like the real Chester.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus Christ!

[Speaker 3]
There's another Jesus Christ. That's just spit and straight facts, James, and you know it.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Fatality. Poor guy. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
But they don't appear unless they're in places like this. So if you haven't been attacked before, um, I think you're probably okay.

[Speaker 2]
That's good to know. We will finish up our gathering here and leave you be. Thank you for your hospitality.

[Speaker 7]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Speaking of which, go ahead and roll me three checks. I'm just checking to see if we get a crit. Roll me three d20s.

What is this for?

[Speaker 2]
Fishing. Oh, I did already. Do you want me to do it again?

For my wisdom check.

[Speaker 1]
These aren't for checks. These are for the results.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, no, I did the results already. That was the three I rolled before. My wisdom check does...

I rolled three d20 flat. I'll delete my recent one.

[Speaker 1]
I rolled a five, a four, and a nine. A five, a four, and a nine. All right.

Any of those results getting adjusted by anybody? Can I adjust them?

[Speaker 5]
I can chrono shift one more.

[Speaker 1]
I could guidance. It's not a check. It's a team result.

If it's not a check, I can't lay dice it.

[Speaker 2]
It's not chrono shift. My minstrel dice can't convince a fish to get on the hook, can it? Oh, I don't know about that.

Oh, good. It'd be like the path... It's not pathfinder.

Wayfinder?

[Speaker 1]
Subclaw? The trailblazer? That one, yes.

Rangers, I think, just get features like that for free.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that makes sense. No, I don't have any of that. Do I get XP for those rolls based on table they're on and stuff?

[Speaker 7]
So, what are you...

[Speaker 1]
Are you folks going to rest here?

[Speaker 2]
It seems fine to take a short rest.

[Speaker 3]
I am taking a short rest while I was chucking out all those lay dice and everything.

[Speaker 2]
It seems safe here.

[Speaker 7]
All righty. She's like, yes, the hunt behinds won't attack you here.

[Speaker 2]
Are we able to summon the dragons down here? Get them to rest? I'm sure they would appreciate having a break.

[Speaker 7]
I would be careful bringing them over... I would be careful bringing them through the forest. I would be very careful bringing them through the forest.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Dragons can stay elsewhere then. I'm sure they will find us when we signal them.

All right. Do you folks... Yeah, I think we rest here for the night and then leave in the morning.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. Long rest it is. Time for some XP.

[Speaker 2]
Is I rolling on the magic table for my fish or the regular...

[Speaker 1]
That was the honor. I believe it. I believe it.

[Speaker 6]
I was also wondering if I could do any rolls as Arcana for the magical stuff.

[Speaker 2]
What was the honor doing? Foraging?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, foraging. Foraging stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You can do two nature checks out of the four. Oh no, three.

Yeah, I could do three. And then the last three can be Arcana. All right.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
All right. That's time. Some numbers.

You are getting the bottom of the barrel. That first 14, it's now a 21. And that 16, it's now an 18.

And now I have no lead ice. No rope for anyone. All right, so you'll be getting three magical results as well.

Let's go! Everyone got three magical results.

[Speaker 2]
I think each magical result's 30 times what you roll in XP.

[Speaker 6]
Is there a table for this or do I...

[Speaker 2]
You rolled D20s for each success.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Speaking of which, so if I ask everybody to give me those now... Damn it.

Oh, I rolled four successes.

[Speaker 2]
Should I have rolled four D20s?

[Speaker 1]
No. Because normally what it does is it costs you, I think, either four successes or three in order to actually roll on the magical table. Right, okay.

But this is a special place, special conditions. All right. But offering you more.

So... All right, so we're basically going to have to figure out the XP in chat, which is fine. But that'll be good.

The next morning comes. This fellow who identifies himself as white spends the night with his wife on the other side of the lake. They come back in the morning.

He's looking pretty happy, pretty refreshed. He's like, by the way, did you ever find my bow or hunting knife?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I think I saw it in the grounds near where we found you.

[Speaker 7]
Uh-huh. I'm going to have to come back for that later.

[Speaker 1]
But for now it's probably best I go see my kid. I've been, I've sobered up a little bit. Still pretty happy, but I understand that it's been ages for my boy.

He did not sound happy about this whole situation. I'm going to get the mother of all I told you so's when I get back. How is he, by the way?

What does he look like?

[Speaker 2]
Sort of like you. I broke into his house and he tried to kill me.

[Speaker 3]
He had a shotgun.

[Speaker 2]
He hasn't lost his edge on knowing bad things, it seems.

[Speaker 1]
Good man. We'll have to see what he kept at the craft. You know, he initially didn't like it all that much going out in the woods and stuff like that.

But I guess he'd tail if he took after traps. He must be pretty good at it. I would assume so.

Hey, so you folks he activates his drift glow. You guys have access to one now as well. And it clears the lower fog out from the local area.

Well, y'all want guidance back to the place?

[Speaker 3]
Are we grabbing his shit on the way or are we just heading to the edge of the forest?

[Speaker 1]
I think I need to get back to see my cave. I don't think...

[Speaker 3]
Forest edge it is.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, you folks will not be bothered. You're currently under the blessing of a fey creature so you will not be bothered on your way out of the forest. And you have the drift glow besides for critters that do not respect the fey spirit's blessing.

You guys may get to the outskirts. Along the way you hear several whoops and hollers and that sound of a branch breaking against a tree. More than once at different pitches and tones.

You guys come to the edge of the forest with a little bit of cloud cover layered on top of you from the tree and then an additional layer of cloud cover. It's partly cloudy on top of the... like the normal actual weather.

Even though you notice like the actual clouds don't seem to pass over this particular forest. They just kind of disappear as they meet its edges. Or as they go over its borders.

You guys hear an elk scream from behind you. It's one of the natives of the forest. So it screams, just kind of like pierces the fog, blows it aside.

Creating a similar path to where you folks were. It starts following after you. Starts walking after you folks.

You see an arm about 40 feet in length. Just the arm. Grab the elk.

It screams again for a moment. You hear a crack and then just movement.

[Speaker 2]
Fucked up.

[Speaker 1]
I hate it here.

[Speaker 3]
I fucking hate it here.

[Speaker 5]
The arm by itself was 40 feet?

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Holy shit.

[Speaker 3]
It's about as terrifying as the finger monster, Jack. I hated that finger monster.

[Speaker 2]
We don't get grabbed though, because they obey our wards, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the drift lobe. At this point, you have the drift lobe and you are beyond the forest border. Right.

[Speaker 2]
Let's signal our dragons and go home.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What a fucking day.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll fire the flare then.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. All of your dragons return. They look unharmed.

In fact, they look like they've had a meal recently. Classic. You have six days of travel back.

Give me a moment. You guys will need to redo your travel roles. Give me justice for this area.

And also your flying.

[Speaker 3]
There's a long rest on our days of travels back. Hit dice slash secondary class die come back as normal, right? Nope.

[Speaker 2]
Travels one per day.

[Speaker 3]
You have to choose either one hit dice or one secondary class die. So I've got six back. So...

I have two more days until I get the next lay tap. But I don't want it to be a forecast tap. So I might...

Give it a lay dice for that so I can't do it on the first day. So the first day goes by and I get a dice back. And how exactly does this work again?

Um... Use my lay dice to increase or decrease the results when determining the effects of a lay line. And then within the range.

So... Boom. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? I'll take it. But did you roll 2d6 for the result?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Is it not? Oh, wait, what?

2d6?

[Speaker 1]
So you rolled 2d6 to determine the effects of the line. Right.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Where is... Where is that?

I thought the effects of the line were determined by the cross my path die.

[Speaker 1]
If I scroll down here... It's a... Laykeeper taps is a 2d6 table.

I assume you do that because I think you've... So that's not when you get it. That's cross my path.

Um... Determining the effects is the 2d6 table.

[Speaker 3]
Where does it say what I need to roll to determine the type? I think I've been fucking this up, but that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you have because you've been rolling 2d6.

[Speaker 3]
No, I haven't been. I've been rolling d8s this entire time. Because my cross my path die is a d8.

Because I never played with it as a d10 because that's only... Yeah, that makes a lot more sense, thinking of it. I can't find on the document where it says 2d6 for the thingy.

That's a good point. I think you might have just skipped it, but that's okay. I know it now.

And the knowing is the battle. Um, alright. So I don't get to...

Alright, that's fine, that's fine. Let's just wipe it clean. Five.

Five is an elemental.

[Speaker 1]
Odd, isn't it? Okay, so cross my path... That's interesting.

Okay, so in cross my path where this should appear is a description of how late taps are used can be found above the latekeeper taps table as well as in the late line section. Same regional features. Um, yes.

Okay, so it should have a note there. I'm going to add it now. Are you blaming Knight for this one as well?

No, this one was all me. Knight did not help me with the secondary classes. I don't know what Knight did.

[Speaker 3]
So important question before I just like discard this.

[Speaker 1]
Knight made a lot of monster stat blocks with incorrect grammar that I could not convince him to correct under any circumstances. Um, and talked a lot, which was good, because I need somebody to talk to when I'm designing it. It's one of the reasons why I love ChatGPT.

Um, but most of his work was in the monster manual. Or the encounter manual.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm going to just like take a fresh leaf then, and just roll 2d6 for all three of the taps I've got stored and call it a day. So, alright. I've got an elemental, a tar, I swear to god if I roll a 2 and just get the same 3, I'm going to fucking...

I'm going to be mad. Okay, a new one! Uplift line.

Alright. Uplift. What does that do?

[Speaker 2]
When I've got some time I might just start making the monster stat blocks in Foundry. Are there any that you want in particular, James?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, uh, the wisps. Thank you so much for offering that. I would love to get the wisps.

Because they're very fun. And I've not gotten to use them yet. They're one of my favorite fucking monsters.

[Speaker 3]
Um, so, question, James, how the fuck does the time alteration work? Does it slow down everything? So, like, what, like, does time to, like, for example, if I used my tar tap, for example, time slows to half its regular speed.

Um, does that like, does that affect us? Or does that just affect the area around us? Or like...

[Speaker 1]
That affects everything in the area around you to where, like, the...

[Speaker 3]
So, so, if I'm understanding, so everything in our area that I've used the lay tap on, it would look to be the same speed.

[Speaker 1]
It would look to be the same speed.

[Speaker 3]
But outside of that, outside of that everything, like, if we were, like, there for a day, two days have passed everywhere else.

[Speaker 7]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Glad I understand that right. Alright. Now I've figured it out.

Alright, now I know that I don't want a tar lay tap. So I've rolled two more days at six days of travel. 2d6.

We roll that. So if you want to slow somebody else down. And then I can roll the d8.

Ah, beautiful. Alright. Getting rid of the tar.

We're taking a dire line. It's beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
Dire Morgan.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. And then I get another tap.

[Speaker 1]
But I can't hold it. So cool. And it looks like Per is also going to get somewhere.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I rolled for him already. Cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways. So yeah, so you guys get back six days later.

[Speaker 7]
Fly in the Bron Locke into an aviary.

[Speaker 8]
Uh huh.

[Speaker 2]
Christ, you're right. Language is elven. You elvish.

Night, what have you done?

[Speaker 1]
I asked him so many times to like I think this is an artifact just in the Polish language. It's been a few weeks ago. So I remember this being an issue of learning it.

Using articles before proper nails was basically like people just default not knew it. I had to keep asking. Like, okay.

The Thorn. If you're describing an attack or like a feature you would say the Moss Fairy. Right?

Yeah. And that's the standard 5th edition grammar. But he would just write Moss Fairy.

Like Petal Drake. Petal Drake XYZ. I'm like, this looks not where he's like, well why does it matter?

Because it has to be worded in the same language as things. Why does that matter? I'm like, well because we're working on a professional project.

Anyways, that's why it's still not out yet. No, it's also not out for many other reasons. Most of which are my fault.

Selecting who worked on it was one of those. But it's still my responsibility.

[Speaker 2]
Doesn't help that Wes is the co-shit, the bad in the middle of making it.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-mm. Who knows? Maybe there'll be a good marketing.

Like, hey, if you don't want to switch to 1D&D but you still want to taste of something fresh maybe this is their jam.

[Speaker 2]
A lot of the 5e plays I know just aren't going to swap to 1D&D.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So you guys are going to make it back to Grondlock. You fly in.

Dragons are kept in sort of temporary stables. Do they have an aviary? No, I don't think Grondlock has an aviary.

I think they probably just ask you to land outside the city. Outside the town.

[Speaker 2]
I will start building one at Sierra's Keep.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. And White goes to find Wayne.

[Speaker 2]
How does that go?

[Speaker 1]
Anybody following him along?

[Speaker 2]
Maya absolutely needs to see this.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, let's all go along if we want.

[Speaker 2]
I'm on the way.

[Speaker 1]
Uh-huh. Let's see here. He actually asks you folks for directions of where to find his son.

And it turns out his son has been living in pretty much the exact same place he's asked for. Ranges are weird. They sure are.

He goes over and just kind of walks up, like, hesitates at the door and knocks on it.

[Speaker 2]
No answer?

[Speaker 1]
Knocks on it again.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, no. I know the trick to getting his attention. No!

[Speaker 3]
Wayne's going to teleport into his house again.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe it's a safe place.

[Speaker 3]
God fucking dammit.

[Speaker 2]
Can I get an advantage because I know what's coming? No, this is a different one. Okay, dex save.

[Speaker 4]
If you fail, I'll just chronoshift. I'll chronoshift the dex save so you can try again.

[Speaker 2]
It's not worth it. I'm going to take a long rest in, like, a half an hour IRL anyway.

[Speaker 5]
15 is too large.

[Speaker 8]
Hello, Vladimir.

[Speaker 1]
You'll be okay. So you dodge what is this time a bunch of spikes coming out of the floor through holes you previously did not see. Here again, a crash upstairs.

Somebody coming down the stairs in a hurry. Uneven footsteps. This time the racking or the chambering of a pump-action shotgun.

French gun, as they call it in this section of the world. Hope you got an explanation.

[Speaker 2]
I found your father. He's okay. He's outside.

He's waiting for you.

[Speaker 1]
Open the door. This is a body I haven't been looking forward to seeing in 40 years, but might as well give him the news.

[Speaker 2]
Just open the door.

[Speaker 1]
He goes over, opens the door. He looks like shot, like, just turns pale white. He's like, what?

Did one of you... Did one of you raise him? Did one of you turn him into one of those goddamn zombies?

He's not a zombie. He's like, he's real.

[Speaker 2]
He's normal.

[Speaker 1]
They lock eyes and like, I'm sorry for not believing you. I did get grabbed. Wayne says, oh, this is clearly fake.

Fuck's sake. White just grabs him, grabs him in a hug. They both start crying for a little while.

[Speaker 5]
Aww.

[Speaker 1]
White actually pulls out of his backpack, couch, one of the few rags that's still, I don't know, it's still contained. He's like, by the way, I found it about 40 years late, but I did find a fix for that leg. There's a little bit more crying.

He's like, you know, when I took you into that forest, it wasn't... I got a lot to tell you. This will bring it all here.

Your mother didn't die in childbirth, but she wasn't a human. It was the... You were actually going to live quite a bit longer than maybe you were expecting.

I just had to take you to her for that to happen, but she's back in that forest, and you got protection this time. The kind that works against critters. I didn't believe you, and I didn't believe her when I was told about it.

But now I do. And I'd like you to go meet her sometime. Wayne is like, yeah.

He's still crying. He's like, alright. Alright, I'll let you know.

I can't I can't I can't thank you enough for thinking me out of that spell. Wayne says, that's how you survived? He's like, well, I didn't have much of a choice.

I mean, I just had dirt with me in the spell. Once we meet back up with her, after I take Wayne to meet his mother, I'd like to come work for you folks. Let's go.

I think there's a few ranger traditions that need to be...

[Speaker 3]
The kindest thing we can do to anyone is employ them so they don't ever have to work for Jaster.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, we could employ the whole unicorn hordes.

[Speaker 3]
True.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. What am I saying? Gyoza's a lifesaver.

[Speaker 1]
Beautiful. That might be slightly outside their skill set, but He's a ranger.

[Speaker 3]
We can just get him salvaging more potion ingredients, actually.

[Speaker 1]
That's one of the things they could do. What they're offering to do specifically is set up a conclave post at Newer. Or sorry, no, I think it's a ranger hall at that level.

It's in the settlement document where basically they have a place of learning for monster hunting. And if armies start moving towards your If armies start moving towards your, whatchamacallit, your keep, they start taking attrition damage. Keeps a bunch of fuckin' rangers out in the woods that start taking them off.

Yeah, send them to Ciara's keep.

[Speaker 2]
That's what I'll do. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
So... Congratulations, folks. We're gonna stop the We're gonna close out the session here.

[Speaker 2]
Sounds good. Thank you for running.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you for running. It was a pretty good session. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Next time we'll steal those toenails. Ew.

[Speaker 4]
How much XP should we get?

[Speaker 3]
He'll post it in the Samurai Bubble here.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are gonna share and get a little extra XP from the magical results that you folks got. You're all going to get at least 2k for finding... I thought that was just going to be like a random thing where you guys got them out of the...

like a no-shot that you were going to get them out of the place. It's just like a tiny note here. But yeah, so you guys got them.

You got white out of the out of the Forlorn Insistent. So you folks will be able to escape there. Let's see here.

You're going to receive a sending from the mermaid who would like to bring you folks back to give you folks another gift whenever you have the opportunity.

[Speaker 2]
Who's around next week to go into the scary forest again?

[Speaker 1]
Not me. What did you guys think of the Hyperhides? I hate them.

[Speaker 3]
Like I hate them, but that's a good thing. I like when they...

[Speaker 4]
I do not want to fight them.

[Speaker 3]
I want to figure out... I want them to be there and be scary and never actually fight them.

[Speaker 7]
I don't think it's possible to fight them.

[Speaker 3]
Well, it's not even about being possible. It's about... Doing it anyway?

It's really like shanked in your sleep essentially kind of combat. You just wake up and a kidney is missing. Except for this, I feel like they would have torn off one of your limbs.

[Speaker 6]
Instead of your kidney, it's your soul.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, ripped out your soul. They've done something freaky to you. They've turned you into whatever that weird being Jaster was where he's a smoking a bottle.

Actually, it's fucking creepy.

[Speaker 1]
He looked like the fucking taken from Destiny. That was the...

[Speaker 3]
Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
And he was formed like a heartless.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
James, I'm not going to correct any of the grammar or anything in these step books, but I will import it exactly as it is into Boundary.

[Speaker 1]
I hugely fucking appreciate that. We'll start off with a...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And I'll make up some... I don't know.

If there's anything for tokens that you have in mind, you can do that. If you've got the step books there it should all roll properly. Yeah, I'll just pick a page and do some.

If you have any requests just shoot me a message and I'll... I like to sit at work and not do my job.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck yeah. That reminds me, I never finished this business report. It was my last day of work anyway.

I'll just finish it tomorrow and shoot it over.

[Speaker 2]
What am I going to do? Nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Oh, it also reminds me. Fools Moon Entertainment is sending me some RPG writing to do.

And one of the things that we discussed was just the trade of writing, but I'm also going to work for those folks for actual freelancing. That'll be fun.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds like it'll be awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's very calm. I don't know why they're sending me a big fucking severance tomorrow. I guess it's just really professional, but this will be a fun two months.

We'll see what happens.

[Speaker 3]
Well, thank you very much for the session. Yeah, no problem. The sultry tones of lawnmowers out the front have finally ebbed away.

I am going to attempt to get some sleep at four in the afternoon like a civilized human being.

[Speaker 1]
No judgment here, dude. I slept until about six... We started at 7.30 my time?

We're supposed to start at seven my time.

[Speaker 3]
I think I slept until 6.30. Yeah, that's my usual sleep schedule, but today there's just as I said, lawnmowers all fucking day. I'm going to I am going to blow up everyone's lawnmowers. That'll just like uproot every blade of grass in a three block radius, I swear.

I'm sick of it. Sick of it. I just want to sleep at degenerate times.

I want to sleep the entire morning through and they won't let me. Bastards. Hell.

Alright. I'll leave you to speak. You all have a good one.

Thanks for the session. I won't be here next week, but I'll be back for weeks afterwards.

[Speaker 5]
I'll probably be around next week if anything comes up.

[Speaker 1]
Good luck, boy.

[Speaker 5]
See ya.

[Speaker 1]
Peace. See ya. ...

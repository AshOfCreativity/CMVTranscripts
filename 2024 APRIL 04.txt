[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not. I could give you a few unique spells, I guess, here? Yes, yes, please.

It's going to be a matter of subscribing and such, but what I really want y'all to do is figure out some strategy for dealing with... Dealing with our blue dragon friend here.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi Smash Dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I have Earthbind prepared. I have Sickening Radiance prepared. These are good.

These are good.

[Speaker 1]
So I'm aware, because I've been watching him, I know that he has like a personal Wyvern Guard, and he has a complement of Drow nearby. And has dominated one of the local settlements.

[Speaker 2]
So we're going to be fighting more than just a dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Well, possibly. Because I know that his lair is above the Drow settlement, and I know the Drow, they have Garrow wyverns. They have, I believe they have a small number of Krill wyverns as well.

Which would be annoying. And the last thing I saw was they were discussing some kind of alliance with Darklings at Fae. And they can't come out in the sunlight.

Which reminds me, I never actually rolled my weather table. Let's see how far we...

[Speaker 2]
Wonder if these allies have been recently talked down.

[Speaker 1]
There's like a cool low-hanging mist everywhere that feels refreshing, rejuvenating even. Even as it, even as the dragon's kind of static electricity is still pervading, I know that he's got a clutch of little ones and some non-sentient surroundings. Overall a fairly strong fellow.

[Speaker 2]
He's got baby dragons?

[Speaker 1]
I think he has younger siblings that are not sentient.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. He's sentient? Yes, I spoke with him.

Oh god.

[Speaker 2]
I convinced him not to attack us, or continue attacking us, the first time we encountered him.

[Speaker 3]
Well, um... Do we have a way to separate him from reinforcements?

[Speaker 8]
Um, I may have some spells.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, please.

[Speaker 2]
Make me wonder. Um, yep. I have...

Ooh, I have enemies abound. Fear, hypnotic pattern. So I could...

I don't know if I... I could probably scare them? Or him?

I could do enemies abound so he could attack everyone around him. But first I should probably curse him. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
First, I do have a curse scroll.

[Speaker 5]
Oh? Very nice.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, um, I have some unpredictable effects. The curse... not a scroll of a curse, I do have some of those, but I do have a cursed scroll.

[Speaker 2]
I think I'll stick with my... magic. It's unpredictable.

[Speaker 6]
Could I use them? Or is this, like, wizard-specific?

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna have to be somebody with some kind of spellcasting ability.

[Speaker 6]
Not for me, though.

[Speaker 1]
Or is otherwise, you know, decent at doing it. I do have one... Tell you what, I do have one scroll from the Red Grove of Rarg that the monks there can use.

They're called Danan Sutras. What do I have here? I have a curse of...

transformation?

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, what is this? Interesting.

[Speaker 3]
That might come in handy. I could also attempt to polymorph the dragon. I don't know...

That would help us get it, um... Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that would help us separate it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if we could do it quickly without the other reinforcements noticing, that could help. Polymorph it into something small and harmless, move it to a location.

[Speaker 1]
It gets a moth-shaped lump somewhere under their skin. And then they start losing their vitals. Which, it's a slow process.

But... It's a slow process, but, um... Trying and failing to remove it speeds up.

[Speaker 8]
The only way to speed it up is by trying and failing to remove it. The curse? Question about this dragon.

I'm gonna post a curse inside. And put in, like, magic. Spells?

Spells.

[Speaker 2]
Is that in the foundry? Like, in the journal? Or not in journal, in items?

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm gonna put it in... I'm gonna put it in the... Now I'm gonna put it on the Discord.

And there's a channel called Spells where I've been putting some of the more unique spells.

[Speaker 2]
There are? There is? Where is this?

[Speaker 3]
It's in thread, right? Can you ping me?

[Speaker 1]
It's going to the forum. To make quests and discussions.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
Gotcha.

[Speaker 6]
Spells.

[Speaker 3]
But, I don't... There we go.

[Speaker 2]
I do have a question about the dragon that I'm gonna ask the wizard. Whenever you're ready. Is this dragon able to be scared?

Do you know if it would be... If I could scare it?

[Speaker 1]
Dragons are not easily cowed, but they can be.

[Speaker 2]
That's good enough.

[Speaker 1]
It's possible, they can be subdued. I had a couple of dragons at one time.

[Speaker 2]
Basically I'm asking if it can take the frightened condition.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the frightened condition. He would answer me for...

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Good.

[Speaker 2]
Curse is ready to fight it? Kibi's always ready.

[Speaker 3]
So this curse, it was a curse the wizard had, right? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Actually, I can't cast this one. This one is something for the monk to cast.

The difference between this scroll and others is you use insight to...

[Speaker 3]
Gotch.

[Speaker 1]
...cast a sorcerer counter.

[Speaker 3]
This wizard, do you have silvery barbs prepared?

[Speaker 1]
I do, I do. Do you have the spell yourself?

[Speaker 3]
I do as well. So I was thinking if we go with the polymorph plan... ...in a further reduced chance of success.

[Speaker 7]
I also have polymorph.

[Speaker 3]
Well... Yeah, I mean, if one fails we could burn all of our resources on this if we want to go with this.

[Speaker 2]
What am I supposed to do? If he comes with a bunch of reinforcements, like a bunch of little dudes hanging around him... I want to do enemies abound, see if we can take some out, and then once that's...

If that succeeds and he takes some out, then we can get rid of him.

[Speaker 3]
So that's another option. Do you have any knowledge on the distance of his eventual reinforcement? Mr. Wizard, by the way, what should I call you?

Oh, you can call me Thalazar. Thalazar, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So the reinforcements themselves... Let's see here, the darklings that he was trading with... We could spend some days investigating them.

Now that I'm unchained, I don't think that the dragon is going to attack unless he does so in force. So we could, and speaking out of character, you guys could engage in some downtime basically at the tower to prepare for this.

[Speaker 2]
If we just left.

[Speaker 1]
Which is also definitely an option.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Doesn't feel too fun out of character, of course, to just leave. I mean, you have a very high level character though, so I definitely see the point.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Phineas, that scroll had several spells on it. So the scroll that had Wall of Stone had all of those spells on it. I did clarify this, using one of them or copying one of them does not destroy the entire scroll.

It only removes that portion of it.

[Speaker 2]
Could we safely get the characters that don't have players here out? Could they leave?

[Speaker 1]
I could give them a teleportation circle out. But at the same time, I kind of want them as insurance to make sure that... I like not getting attacked.

[Speaker 2]
Why would they be used for... How could they ensure you don't get attacked?

[Speaker 1]
Do you see this monk here? First of all, I've never seen a monk with a gun. Second of all, he's been fairly effective in getting me out of this situation to begin with.

[Speaker 3]
A monk with a gun.

[Speaker 1]
I've never seen someone stun the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
I love you. Out of character, I did not say that.

[Speaker 1]
You love me out of character, alright, that's fine.

[Speaker 9]
No, I love the gun. My god.

[Speaker 1]
And then Dallas's character, this Randall creature, has been very good at fetching me more margaritas so far, so I'm not really... Yeah, I definitely want them nearby.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, so you said downtime? That we could spend this as a bit of downtime? In that case, I'd like to do meditation.

I'd like to do the meditation downtime action.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Equals 10 plus the character's level, and I make a...

[Speaker 1]
I will have monk adieu in this.

[Speaker 6]
Advantage, perfect. 23, pass. And then I get...

My reward is focus points. The character... Alright, how many do I get, though?

[Speaker 3]
James, if I do downtime here, I cannot do... Can I do the formal downtime thing as well? The what downtime?

Like the formal, you know, the one we send in downtime actions, like that thing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's between sessions, remember?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, nice, I was wondering if they, like, obstruct each other. Very nice. So we want to just scout the thing?

Does anyone else want to do it? Should I? I doubt I am the most competent.

[Speaker 8]
What are we scouting?

[Speaker 3]
Like, the area to make sure reinforcements aren't...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Charis can help with that. She's got wings.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I feel like you should just do it in that case, because I'm not the best at stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Charis can do that. Absolutely. Gonna be...

Perception, right?

[Speaker 6]
So I get four focus points. Where do I keep track of these?

[Speaker 2]
For investigation.

[Speaker 7]
I will also do the meditation downtime.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. I could have Monk assist you with this one as well. Evelyn, would you like to do some...

Yeah, meditate.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, right, glows. Right, some spellcasting.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So I got some of these from an artifice ages ago, and I noticed that we do have somebody else with a firearm here. Okay, I just crashed there for a second there.

[Speaker 7]
But I will do the meditation downtime.

[Speaker 2]
I'll scout around. Let me get back in here. All right.

Spell, though. Spells. Is there anything else that needs to be done?

Because I also have Kibi. She could be doing things. I just don't exactly know what to do.

[Speaker 1]
Kibi, could you go hunting? I suppose.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi can absolutely do that.

[Speaker 1]
It would be of fantastic assistance here.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi leaves immediately to do this.

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and do some hunting rolls.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let me open up that.

[Speaker 1]
And then Phineas, is there any downtime that you would like to achieve? The wizard is happy to assist you. And while you're thinking of that, I will tell Evelyn, hey, do you want to...

Is there still a type of spell that you are looking to acquire or create as of recent? This is one of the privileges of having a tower, is a little bit of spell research.

[Speaker 3]
Well, it seems best to be prudent in these matters. Some form of abjuration spell. Perhaps the shield spell?

The shield spell? Don't you already have the shield spell? Oh, I mean, I'm researching it, perhaps improving it.

Otherwise, I don't know what I'm missing, really. Okay, it's the opportunity.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's not about what's missing, it's about what you can create.

[Speaker 3]
Supreme defense. I don't know, I haven't... I suffered a close encounter with a dragon a while back.

I think I'm more in the realm of defense right now. Do you have anything in particular?

[Speaker 1]
When I say create, I mean creating spells.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, it's like in the book, right? The Strongholds and Followers?

[Speaker 1]
Kind of like that, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, what do you... Do you need me to roll anything? Yeah, that would be great.

[Speaker 2]
Um, can I... Because I did a nature check, but I failed it. I'm pretty sure I failed it.

Survival dice covers that, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's exactly what it's there for. You'll be making four checks total.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Six... So that's eight.

So fourteen?

[Speaker 1]
Fourteen would fail.

[Speaker 9]
Would fail?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'll expend one more. Okay. Remember, you do have to commit to them beforehand.

Oh. Alright, fifteen will make it. Fifteen is to succeed.

Alright, go ahead and make the remainder of your checks.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Speaker 5]
So that would be...

[Speaker 1]
And while you're doing that, Phineas! Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
This is Silk, is it? Yeah, Silk would like to... Try to make...

Try to craft some special, uh... Some special ammunition. He wants to make a silencing round.

So this would be a round, or rounds, depending on how much he's able to create. That would just create a silence effect. But a small one, like a five-foot radius around the target.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I think I have some luck sitting in a round here. Go ahead and make a check to craft.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, I have to disable conditional stuff that's helping me with this. Because it doesn't apply. No worries.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I think I only passed three.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. Alright, you got two common, or one rare?

[Speaker 9]
Um...

[Speaker 2]
Two common. I think I'm gonna go with two common, because that's more.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, yeah. And remember, you can increase the results of these as well. So go ahead and roll a 2d20.

Okay, 2d20.

[Speaker 2]
So that's a 1 and a 13.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and are you increasing either of these?

[Speaker 2]
How would I do that?

[Speaker 1]
If you were trailblazing, right?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yes. What does increasing it do? Obviously it increases it, but how so?

[Speaker 1]
It increases the result on the table.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll do two of these. And that's 2d8. That's a 7 and a 6, which makes 13.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 13. And then are you editing the other one? Is that two 13s?

[Speaker 2]
Um, no, it's a... maybe. Uh, yes, it is two 13s.

But no, I'm not editing the other one.

[Speaker 1]
Basically, you come across two mountain goats.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay, Charis, you, in the meantime, you find a few interesting things. One, you see that the dragon is currently recovering inside of his...

You see the dragon recovering inside of his lair. And he is nursing a ring that has a rather striking similarity to... You've seen enough of it at this point.

It's very clearly from the mummy itself, or from the same kind of culture that the mummy comes from. You also see a small... probably about two dozen darklings riding about a dozen glitter wyverns, which are...

Very interesting creatures. They're currently sitting inside of the... They appear to be like...

you know, they're discussing something. They have a small set of camps that they're just hanging around right now and waiting for the sun to... You're able to spy on them for a little while.

They're waiting for the sun to go down so that they can actually parlay with the dragon itself. And then the drow themselves are waiting for... You do see them at the bottom of the settlement.

There are about three dozen who are... About three dozen... There are about three dozen wyverns.

And then each of these wyverns has two riders. Most of them have crossbows. Then a selection of them have repeating crossbows.

[Speaker 2]
So we have... three... how many wyverns?

Can you go over that one more time so I can write it down?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, absolutely. So you have... there's a bunch of darklings on the...

Darklings on the west side. In the center. In the center.

Using his... Attuning to a ring. You have deep elves.

Three dozen riders each. And then on your way back, you will see about a hundred quaggoths. Oh boy.

[Speaker 2]
That's not something I can spell.

[Speaker 1]
I got it. You are actually approaching the tower slope.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Then I am going to... It's the time. What is the time?

[Speaker 2]
Done all that work to level up my characters just for them to die.

[Speaker 3]
Did he say a hundred quossets, by the way?

[Speaker 1]
Quaggoths.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's the other one.

[Speaker 1]
Quaggoths. Okay, I was like... These guys on the other side of the...

These dead guys here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I was like, why are there so many quossets? You know the familiar guys? Huh.

[Speaker 7]
That could be useful.

[Speaker 1]
Sentiment bag.

[Speaker 2]
What if we attack them? Like we leave the tower and attack them so that we have the daytime. It's not a bad idea.

Because we're losing daytime. But if we attack now, we can do it.

[Speaker 4]
Press the advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Precisely.

[Speaker 4]
I put Silk's result in out of character. Officer Vaanat.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect, perfect. Okay, so Silk... Jump to bottom.

I am at the bottom. Craft the result of 36. Okay, you are going to get two stacks.

So basically 20 rounds. One for... 10 rounds for your...

10 rounds for your bolt action and 10 rounds for the musket.

[Speaker 4]
Excellent. Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then... Let's see here. I'm meditating.

What was your... What was Rowan's result? Oh, hang on.

Let me pull it up real quick. 22 in sight. Yeah, you make it.

Alright, so Rowan and Corpus both get a lightning bolt spell. Oh. I'm meditating here.

[Speaker 7]
So is that, you know, only lasting for a week? Or is that just on my spell list?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's not on your spell list. It's a free use of the spell. Oh, okay.

So basically like a spell scroll. Okay. Okay, and then Fawn, I think you just need to roll some d100s.

You just need to follow the procedure inside the strongholds and followers.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it is that procedure. Gotcha.

[Speaker 4]
And how long does the silence last?

[Speaker 3]
He'll be right back. Oh, cool. Yeah, don't screw us over.

Please. Like with the silence. We have more than one spellcaster.

It would be kind of funny if we just...

[Speaker 1]
It lasts, so it's a small area. It lasts until the... Okay, so it will be...

At the beginning of each of their turns, they can make a save. It'll last for three rounds. At the beginning of each of their turns, they can make a save.

To end it early. A constitution save.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh, con save. I hear, whenever I hear con save, I just smile a bit.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so it's a one month plus one... So, one month plus one, and then what level is the tower? Like, how long are we downtiming here for?

[Speaker 1]
Can you say that louder?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. So, the time required. Do we have enough?

Because it's one month plus two...

[Speaker 1]
He's assisting you with magic here.

[Speaker 3]
I'm confused. So, we just skipped the downtime part? Because I'm looking at the book.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so I... Yeah, so you keep saying you're looking at the book, but I don't know what you're referring to exactly, because I don't have it in front of me. So now I'm going to look it up.

Which will take me additional time.

[Speaker 3]
I do not have it memorized.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you are skipping some of the time requirements, but... Is it just in Stronghold Actions?

[Speaker 3]
Page 24. Page 24.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so which spell are you researching?

[Speaker 3]
Shield.

[Speaker 1]
Shield, okay.

[Speaker 3]
B level one.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, go ahead and roll a d8. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 3]
Roll a d8. Six.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, interesting. Okay, so we're going to do this as the... Four.

Okay, so... What I would like to do... Oh, there's one other restriction.

The magic user can only cast a spell a number of times. Spell casting modifier, what's it do? They must take an extended rest if they want to cast a spell again.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so it's like a one-time thing, that's why. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Right. So we can either set this at... It's going to make you immune until the start of your next turn.

So... Immune to all damage. Oh, yeah, fuck it.

It's a shield spell.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So to clarify... You said you can use it four times?

Yeah, and that's my spell casting ability modifier. Until... And if I make my own tower, can I extend the rest there and keep the spell?

[Speaker 8]
Of course.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it'll stay on your spell list. You probably do it at a... If you take a class with any...

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, jeez, my apartment complex just sent me something. Okay, and you guys are looking to... Now that you guys have all the stuff done...

You know where the enemy is, you know where they're at right now... What would you like... Here we go.

You guys said you want to start taking the fight to the enemy.

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
We have some day time, and they hate day time, so... Yep. Let's go.

Everything alright on your end?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I was wondering why I was hearing my own voice. And I had the video playing.

Do we have any artificers in the party? I don't think we do.

[Speaker 2]
There's one class that I will not touch.

[Speaker 7]
I gotcha. Someday I'll get to play one.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I have enough brain cells.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then... Phineas, did you level up, by the way? Did Silk level up?

Correct. Yes, Silk is now level 9. Excellent.

Excellent. Okay. He is going to give your...

Let's see here. This is on loan for the moment. But I'm going to give your friend here an amulet.

Let's see. Which I've, in true D&D tradition, I am using incorrectly. It's an amulet.

It's a protective thing. You can't have an amulet of the planes, because you're not getting protected from the planes. But he's going to give your...

He's giving your hireling an amulet here that casts the 21st Salute cantrip.

[Speaker 9]
Wow. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I've put it in chat already. You're free to copy it down if you wish.

[Speaker 4]
Holy shit.

[Speaker 9]
Nice.

[Speaker 4]
That is absolutely vicious.

[Speaker 2]
Come in handy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god. On loan. Right.

Right. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You get five uses of the cantrip with this amulet.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Alright, thank god. Not permanent crit.

That would just be too good. Alright, let me add this as an item.

[Speaker 1]
Renaming the spell to Evelyn's Aegis? Yeah, you should absolutely do that shit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no, the book has... I mean, I don't know how much you pay attention to it, but it says... Like, it gets a name depending on the effect, but Aegis sounds much better.

Even if it's not the name which appears in the spellbook, I'm 100% going to call it that.

[Speaker 1]
I like it. Okay. So, here's what we're going to do.

We're going to take, like, a 15-minute break. We're going to come back. I want you guys to decide, or think...

You don't have to... You can discuss amongst yourselves. What are you killing?

And what are you hunting down? You have four different targets. One of which is sort of in the way of you guys and the other targets right now, but you...

There's ways around that. So it's up to you.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Well, the dragon is nursing his wounds. And we can draw out the creatures that...

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We're just fighting them, I guess. They should come to us, right?

[Speaker 2]
There's a hundred quag-blech who are slowly approaching the tower. We could totally just go around them. Go around them, they get to the tower.

Nothing here. Well, never mind. That's...

No, because there's going to be people here at the tower.

[Speaker 9]
Um...

[Speaker 7]
Worst comes to worst. Lightning bolt. Get rid of them.

And start making use of...

[Speaker 3]
Fungus zombies. So, but the... Our goal is to feed these people, right?

[Speaker 2]
Well, our goal... The rescue was for us. The people, the player characters that are trapped here.

Yes, exactly. And... Can we steal things?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Like, really? Or can we get them out somehow without...

Like, stealthing... Going invisible, you know the drill.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think the wizard wants his tower... Oh, yeah. Safe.

[Speaker 3]
But if we could get them out of the way, then... Because the dragon has our dragon's breath, right? But we will be restricted in our use of AoEs.

If we have, like... He essentially has hostages, right? The dragon.

We can't fully use our AoEs spells and stuff. Because we risk hitting them.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Well, the... The people that we are trying to keep alive are down in the tower.

Like, they're on the fourth floor. The wizard and him, he can stay on the fourth floor. Everybody else...

If we all just stay on, like, the top floor... Okay. We can potentially just...

Um... I don't know, stay out of the way of the AoE. And draw the fire of the...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Of the thing. But do we not want, like, the wizard to help us?

[Speaker 2]
Well, the wizard... He's not really an enemy. He just kind of goes crazy sometimes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Happens to the best of us. Probably just, like, some weird seasonal wizard depression.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no, that's what I meant. Don't we want his help? You said he would be on the bottom floor.

[Speaker 2]
I think he helped us by... Helping us, like, with the spells and preparations and whatnot.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, yes, but we could at least ask him if he wants to, like... Engage, I guess. But, yeah, no.

[Speaker 2]
But if we leave... If we leave, we can attack first. If we stay, then we're kind of just waiting for them to attack us.

Which, then they'll have the advantage. If we stay out... If we leave, we can stay outside.

And, um... Attack them from there.

[Speaker 3]
But then we endanger the player characters.

[Speaker 2]
Well, the player characters can come with us. Wait, aren't they locked up? No, not at all.

The only people that are... No, we were trapped in the tower because the dragon was attacking us each day. And if we left, we would have been attacked.

Edmund found that out first hand.

[Speaker 3]
So what's preventing us from just grabbing the prisoners and just leaving?

[Speaker 2]
If we do that, the wizard dies. And the prostitutes also die. Because the dragon will attack them.

So we'd be dooming these people to die.

[Speaker 3]
Oh... But... Wait...

How does the wizard... Because the dragon would attack them, right. But what if we bring our friends outside?

And then fight the dragon? With the wizard?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Our friends are coming with us to attack.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, right.

[Speaker 2]
But there's people... There's a hundred... There's a hundred quaggaths.

[Speaker 3]
They're approaching the tower.

[Speaker 2]
So we have to... There are a hundred of these guys.

[Speaker 3]
These freakazoids. Are they strong? Like, I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Kinda? I mean, if there's a hundred of them, then yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 9]
So...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but... You know, it's... I have fireballs.

And he has lightning bolts, you know.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I'm wondering how much...

[Speaker 9]
If we... Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
We can kill them. And then we can leave, I suppose. To go towards the thing.

It's already midday, so the fight's going to be a while.

[Speaker 3]
What do you call the creatures? Quaggals?

[Speaker 2]
Quaggath? Quag... Goth.

Yeah. It's a weird word.

[Speaker 8]
Weird.

[Speaker 2]
Really, that's... Those are the people that are coming towards the tower. Those are the people that we need to fight off first.

Yes.

[Speaker 3]
So the dragon is not being... Can the dragon see us?

[Speaker 2]
No, the dragon's nursing its wounds in, like, a cave right now.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so it's not even... Okay, yeah. In that case, let's kill these guys.

Yeah. It's just... It makes me nervous, because there's a hundred of them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And then by the time we kill them, we'll have burnt out our spell slots.

[Speaker 3]
I mean... Wait, so how many third levels do we have? I have three plus four for...

A fireball is... A 20-foot radius. So it's a 40-foot...

How many can you do, though? So it's... If they are medium, I can kill 40 of them with a single fireball, if they die in a single fireball.

But I don't know, like, how... How many... I don't know just about these creatures.

[Speaker 4]
How many spell slots a third level or higher do you have?

[Speaker 3]
Five.

[Speaker 4]
That's five fireballs.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And I would prefer to not use the fourth ones. But the thing is, like...

Has anyone fought these creatures? Yes.

[Speaker 9]
You have?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. How many hit points did they appear to have?

[Speaker 2]
Um... I wish I could remember. It was at least...

At least 50, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's, like, two fireballs.

[Speaker 2]
No, it was like 16.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And there's 100 of them. So that's 100 little squares.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, no. It's like 16.

[Speaker 1]
That's good to know. Ah, fuck. I was muted.

Goddammit. It's like 16 hit points.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
I severely overestimated them. Yeah, that makes it a lot better.

[Speaker 4]
Well, this also means that coverage is going to be more important than throughput. By which I mean area of effect is going to be more important than doing a lot of damage per target.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, of course.

[Speaker 4]
Do you have any higher level spells that have bigger than a 20 foot radius?

[Speaker 3]
I have Sickening Radiance. I'm not spending my 4th level slots on these guys unless I absolutely have to. It's an extreme waste of resources.

Especially when there's a dragon coming up. Does anyone else have any spells?

[Speaker 4]
I do.

[Speaker 3]
Not any damage ones.

[Speaker 4]
I have Illusion stuff I can do.

[Speaker 3]
That's about it. Yeah, but that's still useful. Like, Hypnotic Pattern.

That has a huge radius as well.

[Speaker 7]
I was thinking of also doing Entangle if it goes down to the ground.

[Speaker 3]
Keep it locked down. I think we're discussing the 100 quack things.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, for that I have stuff like Moonbeams.

[Speaker 2]
I can shoot them. I have Hypnotic Pattern, but I only have 2 3rd level and 2 4th levels.

[Speaker 3]
I think I should be fine, actually, in that case. Let me know. Worst case scenario, what happens if we just leave here?

Our friends die, right? Probably? There was a voice.

[Speaker 8]
Is it okay if I listen in?

[Speaker 4]
I asked, is it okay if I listen in since you're doing a dungeon of some kind?

[Speaker 3]
Hi, Mushroom. Good to see you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so trying to sneak past or kill some of the quaggas, we mostly handle it as a skill challenge. And a couple of really fast combats, because they do die quite quickly.

[Speaker 7]
That sounds good, right? If no one has any... I have Tidal Wave, but at the same time I also have Pass Without Trace, if you just want to sneak around them.

[Speaker 9]
Since I can do it at will, thanks to my staff.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we can try that first. There's no reason not to try.

[Speaker 1]
The thing that happened last time when Edmund got ran out was he was attacked by the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but we can attempt to ambush the quagga.

[Speaker 1]
I was saying that in response to what happens if we just leave here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Yes, thankfully.

[Speaker 1]
We start getting ruthlessly hunted down.

[Speaker 2]
If we just go around the quaggas, they'll get to the tower and kill all the people in the tower, right?

[Speaker 1]
Karis, the last time Karis fought this guy, he did a real fucking number on the party.

[Speaker 2]
So he'll probably be fine if we bypass the quaggas?

[Speaker 1]
They're just moving towards the tower so far.

[Speaker 2]
Why don't we just go around them and hope for the best?

[Speaker 9]
Sure.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so stealth, I guess?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and if you guys do get into a fight with some of them, it's not going to be like they all collapse on you, because they're not all in the same place.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Assuming you are casting Pass Without Trace, Phineas, that's a 25.

[Speaker 4]
I can't cast Pass Without Trace. I can, because of my staff.

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, yes.

[Speaker 4]
How dare you. How dare you assume that I can cast a spell for you. I'm not your monkey.

Oh, the Sioux monsters are springing back.

[Speaker 1]
That was fun.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, you know, I do have Polymorph, and I do have Awakened, so...

[Speaker 7]
But if Winston's so do I, thanks to my staff.

[Speaker 4]
So this is a flat plus ten on top of the stealth check? Mm-hmm. Yep.

[Speaker 7]
You forgot to add ten, so that'd be 20, actually.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Karis's would be 39. I'm, uh, she's a, um... Karis has eight levels in Bard and two levels in Rogue, and her stealth is better than her persuasion.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez. That's awesome, though.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, thanks. Yeah, Cloak of Elvenkind gives advantage to me on the stealth and disadvantage to them on the perception this evening.

[Speaker 1]
All right, who is... Go ahead and arrange yourselves on the map in your marching order. In this blue thing, and you can have as many or as few ranks as you wish.

Blue box, so in this way. Uh, front at top? Yes.

Uh, yes, front at top. Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, Kibi, I'm going ahead of you. Do we want to maybe not be in lightning bolt formation?

[Speaker 3]
That's a good point. I'm also going to ritual cast Blind Seed again.

[Speaker 1]
We are still technically in lightning bolt formation, but... Well, that's just anybody who's in two points, right? I think what he means is if everybody is in a single straight line, then that's lightning bolt formation.

Go ahead and grab your hireling as well.

[Speaker 3]
We have a steed. We have two.

[Speaker 2]
We have, um... Two large mountain goats that are both large enough to ride.

[Speaker 1]
They are not happy about having been caught. Are you bringing them along?

[Speaker 2]
We want to bring them along?

[Speaker 1]
Or using them in some way. I'm happy to, I'm happy to reduplicate that.

[Speaker 3]
The white thing is my phantom steed. Okay. Um...

[Speaker 2]
We could bring them along for a distraction later if we need one.

[Speaker 1]
I really like that, just kind of like hit them on the rump and let them start sprinting.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like start sprinting and screaming. Uh, yeah, can I, I'm going to use some rope to like make it so that they can't scream.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
You are a good person. Um, because I don't want them to scream. I've lived near goats.

They're very loud.

[Speaker 1]
They are very loud, yes. Let's see here. Okay, yeah.

Okay, so you guys will just skip the first two parties that you come across. You guys just straight up skip. And then, let's see here.

Who's at the front here? Kibi and Corphis. Kibi, you are well suited for this because you're a trailblazer.

I'm going to treat you two as my vanguard here. Go ahead and roll.

[Speaker 8]
Forward. Looking out for things.

[Speaker 2]
How did I do? Oh!

[Speaker 9]
Okay, we did well.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty good. Okay, Kibi, you see that there is a path that has a carefully set trap over top of it. It's a rolling boulder trap that would fall behind you guys and then move down the ravine that you're currently in.

[Speaker 2]
I'll relay that information quietly.

[Speaker 1]
There is a path to go to avoid it. You don't see a trigger if there is one. There is a path to avoid it, but it takes you guys into the higher ground that's more visible.

[Speaker 2]
Can I... Wait, is there like a way to disarm it? Oh, we can't find the trigger.

Okay. So there's an obvious path there. Can I...

Does anyone have like a find trap spell?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Right here in Silco Point 2's eyeballs.

[Speaker 3]
What kind of traps specifically are we worried about?

[Speaker 2]
So it has a trigger of some kind, but it's a big boulder.

[Speaker 3]
It's a big boulder that wants to flatten us. Do you want me to virtual cast... what's it called?

Locate Object? For... To find giant boulders?

[Speaker 2]
Well, the boulder we can see. It's in the big rock. It's just the trigger, we don't know where the trigger is.

[Speaker 4]
Hold jump and circle. Wait, so is the boulder the thing that will only see that after we trip the trap?

[Speaker 2]
Well, we've seen it.

[Speaker 4]
It wants to... What is the thing we're trying to detect? Where the trigger is.

[Speaker 2]
Like, where do we...

[Speaker 4]
You detected the trap, but not the trigger.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We know where the trap is, we just don't know what triggers it. What if I send my phantom stadium to die and then get a new one? Can we get out of the way of the trap?

[Speaker 4]
That's a little cynical.

[Speaker 3]
It can't even think. Anyway, that's an option.

[Speaker 2]
Will that work?

[Speaker 3]
They will notice us, though, probably.

[Speaker 2]
They'll notice us, unless we can get away really quickly.

[Speaker 4]
Can we just look around for the trap for a little bit?

[Speaker 3]
Silencing arrow. Right.

[Speaker 4]
You want me to shoot the ground?

[Speaker 3]
Shoot the rock, if you can get it.

[Speaker 4]
Shoot the rock so that when it moves it doesn't make noise? Yes.

[Speaker 2]
The silence would stay on the rock? Ooh, that's a good idea, I like that.

[Speaker 4]
First I would need to shoot my gun with the silencing bullet so that the gun doesn't make noise.

[Speaker 1]
It's a voxidium round, so it's not going to make noise.

[Speaker 3]
I can take your praises now.

[Speaker 7]
Reminder, so long as everyone is within my Pass Without Trace level, we cannot be tracked by non-magical means.

[Speaker 4]
I have a foundry question out of character. I've got multiple types of ammunition for each weapon. Is there a way to change when I use the weapon?

Is there an easy drop-down? I can go into the weapon definition and edit what ammunition it's going to be using, I think.

[Speaker 1]
I wish I knew the answer to that question.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, cool. No problem. Silk will do that.

Uh, uh, do you want an attack roll?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sure. Yeah, go ahead and make an attack roll. Okay.

We're sorry, go ahead and make me a perception check. You got it. Wait, no, no, no, you guys, there's no need for a check here, you would just see this.

When you look through the scope, you see an invisible stalker next to the boulder.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, I will, uh, I will point this out to my allies. Stalker?

[Speaker 2]
Is it a creature?

[Speaker 9]
Or just a weird elf?

[Speaker 4]
An invisible stalker is, I think it's technically a creature from another plane. It's an element.

[Speaker 1]
It's a gusty shape that you can, or a shape made out of gust.

[Speaker 4]
In lines. Is that Frank Rosetta?

[Speaker 1]
Frank Rosetta drawing the wind.

[Speaker 4]
Basically, you summon them to assassinate something, I think. Or am I thinking of invisible stalkers?

[Speaker 3]
So perhaps it is the trigger? Like notices us. And, yeah, flicks it.

[Speaker 2]
So if we just go around it, it won't do that?

[Speaker 3]
We could try to hide. Yeah. But we're like, we are already hiding.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're already stealthing. So if we go around it, we should be fine. Yeah.

Can we see which way it's facing? We can go that way. We'll go behind the way it's facing.

[Speaker 4]
Sure. Yeah. Does it seem to be...

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So it has not noticed anybody, I guess. It has.

[Speaker 2]
We'll go behind it.

[Speaker 4]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Luckily, we don't die.

[Speaker 4]
Are we expecting to be attacked by a dragon at any time? Like, are we on the lookout for that happening?

[Speaker 2]
Well, it was in its cave, licking its wounds.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm assuming it's still there, but we'll hear it if... We'll hear its flapping of wings. Damn dragons can swoop down at any moment.

Right. Kiwi will smell it coming.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, let's pray to Kiwi.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Next up. There we go.

Fixed. Okay. Very good.

Okay, so next up, you guys come across a party of quaggas that has lagged behind, and they're currently carrying a sled with a tarp over it. It's the... Whatever is underneath of this sled is huge in size.

It's about two groups of quaggas, so there's about 20 of them total, and four of them have blue... Have, like, a blue claw print? I'm not going to say claw print.

Four of them have markings on their foreheads that are reminiscent of a dragon claw. Vaguely... Almost like a question mark in the way that it's...

[Speaker 2]
Ooh. How many are there?

[Speaker 1]
Four with the... 20 total, and four of them have that mark.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like we should keep going, but I also really want to know what's under that thing.

[Speaker 1]
Right now, there's... So your path is leading straight into them. There is a hole down to your left that just leads into darkness, and then there is a path on the...

Again, there is a path on the right that leads to more open ground, but it's a short way into another ravine, another one of these... Another one of these, like, dried-up rivers. Basically, that lets you crouch to just kind of get three-quarters covered.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I'm always up for more killing.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we gotta be careful about our resources, though. I mean, I'm also down to attack them. It's just we also do have to keep in mind the...

[Speaker 7]
I do have Tidal Wave prepared.

[Speaker 2]
Will it harm the supplies that they're carrying? Because I really want to know what's in there.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Well, they... I could cast Invisibility on myself and go check it out.

Go sneak onto it.

[Speaker 9]
You could certainly try.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, they might be able to see Invisibility. I don't know that the ones with the special markings... I don't know what kind of magic ability they have, so I'm a little...

[Speaker 2]
We could all stand ready to attack if they do.

[Speaker 6]
Did we just... Okay, here's what I vote, since I've been quiet for a bit. We just, like, Alpha Strike them with Lightning Bolt.

Kill them.

[Speaker 2]
Can we do it without harming the supplies that they're carrying?

[Speaker 1]
Naturally.

[Speaker 2]
Got an angle?

[Speaker 1]
I am going to... Go ahead and just put them on.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, let's go. Let's do it.

[Speaker 1]
I'll, like, arrange them in a... Tell you what, let me add a Combat Encounter, so you guys can add yourselves to the initiative. They're at the point where they're getting much closer due to the time that you guys have been discussing this, so I won't allow any other preparatory actions, but you guys will have surprise.

[Speaker 2]
I think the Lightning Bolt's a good idea. This dragon is a lightning dragon, so I don't know if lightning is going to work on it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, they were marked with the dragon's claw as well. Yeah. So we'll see what that's about.

[Speaker 2]
Nope. And then, quickly, we'll get the fuck out of here in case there's other reinforcements.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 9]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Did it say we're putting them up? I see that.

Probably. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Creature. Huge is what?

[Speaker 3]
Three by three.

[Speaker 1]
If the sled is on.

[Speaker 5]
So what have you guys been up to?

[Speaker 1]
Art! Hello! Add yourself to the initiative.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Dr. Basha, congratulations. There are Darklings in this area, and Dr. Basha...

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Initiative.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, man. These guys look like maybe they don't only rely on their sight. Six there.

[Speaker 5]
Christ, that is a lot of creatures.

[Speaker 1]
They're like little minion guys, so maybe it'll work.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Just so I can get a dig on the situation, from what I heard, everyone's trying to stealth past all this. Okay, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
Originally. This one they're trying to actually get in.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Here's the thing. If they attack somebody, it's not like everything is going to come down on them at once.

[Speaker 2]
Because whatever's in this thing, is it moving? Are they transporting anything live?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Hard to tell from this distance. It's not really about distance, because you guys are close, but really it's about the fact that they're moving something up.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
And so you would be able to tell looking through that. God, that seeing visibility scope just comes in such fucking handy. I love that we did that.

You're able to see. I never committed my changes to my gear.

[Speaker 3]
No! That's it. That's it.

Okay. I can hit them all, all of them except one with a fireball, or everyone with a hypnotic pattern.

[Speaker 4]
Now the fireball might wreak some havoc, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It'll kill them, but the stuff...

[Speaker 3]
Yes. So hypnotic pattern... It could be anything under there.

[Speaker 2]
I think...

[Speaker 3]
It's a mystery box.

[Speaker 2]
The... The... What is it?

The lightning bolt should go on one side, and then we can take the others out with our weapons and cantrips. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So do you want me to cast hypnotic pattern on all of them?

[Speaker 4]
I could totally do that. Oh, I love that idea.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So it's a... Let's see here.

It's a... Oh no, it's a 30-foot cube. Never mind.

Maybe I can't hit all of them.

[Speaker 2]
I can hypnotic pattern some, and we can attack the others. Yeah, no. I'm...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I have a hypnotic pattern as well, so I was wondering if I should do it.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to?

[Speaker 3]
I could.

[Speaker 2]
But I'm trying to put a 30... Your spell slots are probably more valuable than mine.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I have silvery barbs memorized, so... Okay, sure.

[Speaker 3]
Feel free to do it as well. I'm going to just cast the cantrip in that case.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to hypnotic pattern... As many as I can.

[Speaker 1]
On each of these thanuts' turn, five of their buddies are going to go. Sorry, four of their regular buddies are going to go.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm going to go ahead and cast... I think.

Wait. Or is the... No.

Okay, there's turn order. Forgot about that.

[Speaker 3]
I can't see my cantrips. What the fuck? I love why you're on my cantrips here.

[Speaker 1]
They've been extinguished.

[Speaker 3]
What? Why? Okay, my cantrips are gone.

I love Andrej.

[Speaker 4]
Forgive me here. Best VTT I ever had. What the fuck, Andrej?

How the fuck did your cantrips disappear?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I have no idea. No, I wrote this is from Indie Beyond. Please forgive me.

It's a 26.

[Speaker 1]
26 to do what? To hit? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 8]
And 15 fire damage. And yeah, I marked it. 15.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Minions, so hit.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Okay. And then I'm just going to move backwards 30 feet.

And that's my turn.

[Speaker 8]
Oh wait, I don't know what I should do. Just... Ah.

And they're surprised, so they're not going to do anything on their turn? Nope. Okay, I'm going to use my lightning bolt that I got from meditating.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know anything about lightning bolt.

[Speaker 2]
Please do it to one of the sides so it doesn't destroy the cart.

[Speaker 6]
8D6. Is it in a line?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, 5 foot wide, 100 foot long. Place it down, shoot away. Um, alright, well, slightest you're all in the way.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to move. Well, that means you need to move up. Wow.

I'm going to do that. Imagine moving. If you go here, you can do it in a line there.

[Speaker 8]
Alright, that'd be 40 feet, so I can do that. I can't end the turn. I want a lightning bolt here.

What do you mean you can't end the turn? What?

[Speaker 6]
No, ignore what I just said.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yes. Because I want a lightning bolt down.

[Speaker 6]
Roll 8D6.

[Speaker 1]
Lightning bolt down. 8D6. Roll 8D6, I'll kill you.

Swear to God.

[Speaker 8]
32. Okay. 32 damage.

Perfect. And I'm just going to have them do... Can somebody roll me...

Let's see here. How many creatures are affected there? Five.

Somebody roll me 5D20. I'm putting you guys to work.

[Speaker 1]
This is what I do. Oh, we've got 10D20. What's a what?

15, so... Anything that beats a 15 will make it.

[Speaker 8]
The first 5D20, nothing beat a 15. So, they all fail. They don't get bonuses, right?

Just flat D20? Oh, they do have bonuses. But...

Oh no, one of those had a...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, roll... Yeah, so two of them... Let's see here.

13. 13 will make it. And then, I don't believe any of the others will.

[Speaker 8]
113, two nines, a seven, and a one. Did you create a thing here? Why did you not create the template?

[Speaker 1]
All right, so it's just these... What, these guys? Or what are you...

[Speaker 4]
Who are you targeting?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's like a beam splitting the difference between the columns to get both of them.

[Speaker 8]
All right.

[Speaker 4]
And then...

[Speaker 8]
So, none of them will succeed. Did you, like, use the spell? Like, when you cast the spell, it should put down a template.

It didn't have access to the spell itself. Ah, okay. Plutonium is a wonderful tool.

So, some of them didn't die. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
No, it just didn't mark them as dead.

[Speaker 3]
They are very much dead.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
I'm sort of putting them in there now. Ah, nothing. I feel like the QL, quality of life thing is quite...

There, okay. And, Corpus, anything else to return? No.

[Speaker 1]
No, okay. Dr. Basha, you have been traveling for quite some time.

[Speaker 8]
I don't know where your character is. Go ahead and put them on the map. Okay.

So, basically, you came to meet with a company of Darklings. Darkling Fae, that you found, because you were having trouble getting in touch with the others. So, there was a...

With the change of seasons, one of your old leads basically fell out, and your Retriever came back.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing. Specifically, it came back with nothing, and then indicated that it was, after speaking to the Glass Mages, that it had to go somewhere else, like a change of direction. So, it came back to report.

Okay, and then you can place yourself really anywhere here. You can take them from behind or nearby or whatever you'd like to do.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Well, I'll just go from behind, then, to take them by surprise.

[Speaker 5]
It did not place the measurement. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's all right. It's a 10-foot radius sphere.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. So, I'd want to try and get as many as possible, and I can choose what to hit.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, you could go to Measurement Controls and create a thing there.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you're right. Here we go. Then just hit those guys, but not what's in the red box.

[Speaker 1]
But not what's in the red box. All right, pretty clever. So, I just need to hit these guys.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. If it's a Glitter Dragon in there, I call dibs.

[Speaker 9]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
Give me a second.

[Speaker 5]
Those would all fail, so they all take 2d6 necrotic damage.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, did you say all those fail?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, all those fail.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Okay. Let's ignore this roll.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, right. Roll damage. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you got it. Yes, these are minions.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Wrong character. But yes, the 2d6, so...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, they have a constant... Sorry, what's your TC?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, 21.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Jesus. Okay. So, and...

[Speaker 3]
What's my reaction to hearing it as well?

[Speaker 1]
And who's up next? Kibi? Kibi, go.

[Speaker 9]
Kibi...

[Speaker 2]
Kibi... I don't really think Kibi can do anything. She's got one Javelin, and...

I'm not really willing to expend it. Well, I can just pick it up afterwards, right? They don't break on impact.

[Speaker 1]
They recover basically a third of the ones that you throw.

[Speaker 2]
I only have one left. Oh, I have two handaxes. I'm going to throw these handaxes.

You can throw those. You can throw those.

[Speaker 8]
Did you move me?

[Speaker 1]
I did not move you. No, where did you go?

[Speaker 5]
I just got and moved next to them. Sorry, I was wondering why I skedaddled.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to... Here. Who are you throwing at?

This one.

[Speaker 1]
This guy, alright.

[Speaker 2]
Takes seven damage. And then I have another attack. I'm going to throw my other one, because I have two of them.

And I fucking fade. She just hits a rock.

[Speaker 1]
It lands at its feet. Okay. And then you have...

Charis.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Then Silk, you are immediately afterwards.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if it's worth casting a spell at this point.

[Speaker 1]
Tell you what, Silk go first, and then Charis go.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm going to take aim with steady aim. And fire a shot with ice bite. With advantage, targeting the leftmost.

Oh, that's only a 14. That still hits, because they are not terribly armored. Alright, and I'm not going to roll damage, since they're minions.

That one is not a minion. That's going to be... Sick.

Okay, alright. I'm going to use now 5d6. That's 31 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, 31. That will actually kill it, yeah. You guys are doing great.

Charis?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to go... I feel like I should shoot this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I was clicked on you. Sorry, okay. I need to...

There is a rustling from underneath of the... From underneath of the tarp.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I feel like I should shoot this guy, but... Yeah, I'm going to shoot him, because I don't want to get close to him.

How many loud noises have we made already?

[Speaker 1]
A few, but like I said, it's not all going to collapse on you at once, because they're not in the... They're all spread out. You guys are traveling like 15 minutes at a time here.

[Speaker 2]
Or I guess 10 minutes at a time, really. Okay, let me know if I did this correctly. I don't know, I think...

I think I've done it correctly.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, it's missing a larger bonus, so that would hit.

[Speaker 2]
That would hit, okay. And then I'm probably...

[Speaker 1]
That's your proficiency bonus, plus the 3 bonus. Plus the plus 3 bonus.

[Speaker 2]
That's... So this is for damage as well?

[Speaker 4]
Not for damage.

[Speaker 1]
When you roll damage, go ahead and click that.

[Speaker 2]
Did I do that correctly?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you did. Yeah, so for some reason, the weapon is not marked as proficient.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I had to... Okay. I just added a plus 4 to it.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. I'll just move this way.

[Speaker 1]
That kills him, I should say.

[Speaker 2]
There we go. And that's my go.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then I am going to... It's my turn.

[Speaker 3]
Rise, remember? Not this creature.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, you know what? No, what I should do is... Because the other guys are...

I don't want to go over two different types of surprise. That would be really fucking annoying. And Rowan, you're last up, so go right ahead.

Alright, there we go.

[Speaker 7]
Finally, I get to cast Lightning Bolt.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, just roll however many saves you have for the creatures that are there. After you roll damage... Oh, hey, that's handy.

Are you casting your free one, or are you casting... Free one. Okay.

Do you have Lightning... Obviously, delete it from your sheet if you don't have access to Lightning Bolt from a different source. I do not know why it's going sideways like that.

You hold CTRL and that lets you aim it. Literally just point out the ones that you're doing, because you already know how many. How many?

Three. Okay, go ahead and roll 3d20.

[Speaker 7]
A 9, a 15, and a 1.

[Speaker 1]
My save DC is 19. Your save DC is 19. The save DC for this is...

15.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so one of them will succeed and not die. Okay, and then I want everybody to make a... Constitution...

Saving throw.

[Speaker 5]
Pain of my existence.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna...

[Speaker 9]
Good job.

[Speaker 6]
Kibi with a 30.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi strong. Good for her, good for her. Everybody passed but Charis and Korpus.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, this is fun, I swear.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Charis and... Korpus. Yeah.

It's literally just Charis and Korpus. Oh, Silk, you still need to make it. Oh, Phineas, are you knitting?

No, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Con saving throw? Yes, please. That's what I'm saying.

That's a big fail.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Charis, Korpus, and... Why are you guys on top of me?

Why are you on top of the other person? Why don't you do that? That's my horse.

No, not you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. I just heard on top and I was like, oh, there are more people.

[Speaker 9]
You've restrained us.

[Speaker 1]
Comes up and... We have a... Medusa here.

That has the lower half of a serpent.

[Speaker 2]
I have a mirror.

[Speaker 1]
Very, very angry.

[Speaker 5]
I have a mirror.

[Speaker 1]
Those of you who succeeded... Take nine damage as you feel blood oozing out of your pores and then solidifying on the exterior of your skin.

[Speaker 8]
Yay. You are...

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 5]
No, I was just saying it was most uncomfortable, I imagine.

[Speaker 1]
I thought somebody else had a... No.

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 1]
That's for the people who failed? No, that's for the people who succeeded. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, the people who failed take no damage, they're restrained.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. But I take back the damage that I dealt to myself?

[Speaker 1]
Guys, if you... If you failed, you are restrained. If you succeeded, you take damage.

[Speaker 3]
Everybody... Everybody clear?

[Speaker 1]
Aye.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, oh. Oh yeah, that was the demo, okay. Nice.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Evelyn, we come to the start of your turn. Your turn ends, you are no longer surprised. Let's see here.

Corpus, same with you, except I think you need to make another saving throw.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. Constitution saving throw coming right up. Much better.

19.

[Speaker 1]
End of its next turn. Yeah, yeah, okay, cool. Alright, you are no longer restrained.

Brings us to Dr. Basia.

[Speaker 9]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Turn ends, no longer surprised. Kibi...

Kibi, were you restrained? No, you weren't restrained. No longer surprised, and now we come to this rather horrifying Medusa.

[Speaker 2]
I love Medusas. I don't like fighting them, but Medusa as a concept is wonderful.

[Speaker 9]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Perfect. Oh, she's large.

[Speaker 1]
She's huge.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Haha.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and she's going to walk on over and... Oh, she's going to slither around the side.

[Speaker 2]
This looks like squishy people. Wow. I'm glad she's walking up to me.

You really want to be certain about that? I'm glad she's walking up to me.

[Speaker 6]
Charis, you are so popular with the ladies.

[Speaker 2]
I know! Whoa. It's my bright flashy colors.

[Speaker 1]
She's got a poison short sword here. Nineteen to hit Rowan. That hits.

And then Rowan, do you have any special bonuses versus poison?

[Speaker 7]
I don't right now, that's a later subclass feature.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so nine damage, none of which is poison. She's going to make one more short sword attack versus you. Then I think she's going to do snake hair versus Charis.

I do have her have halo spores. Okay. Is that just on you constantly?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it is always around me unless I use that later subclass feature. I don't have that, so I just always have it. DC 19 constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
Is this necrotic? Yes, it's necrotic. Okay, cool.

Oh, wow.

[Speaker 7]
That's three necrotic damage.

[Speaker 1]
It's definitely going to hit.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone here speak Sylvan?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Does Medusa speak Sylvan?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then a total of 14 damage to Rowan as well. And do some neck bites.

[Speaker 5]
I'm pretty sure they just speak common, unless I'm misremembering.

[Speaker 1]
But it is. Charis, you take damage.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, how much?

[Speaker 1]
15 damage total. All right.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
Do we want this dead quickly? Like fireball quickly?

[Speaker 8]
What?

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, hold on.

[Speaker 1]
Don't ask that in the middle of combat. Or not in voice. Put it in chat, that's fine.

Charis.

[Speaker 2]
Can I move my arms?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I have a mirror in my bag. I'm going to pull out the mirror and shove it in front of her face.

[Speaker 1]
I like it. Which mirror? Or just like a regular mirror?

[Speaker 2]
Just a mirror. I don't know when I got it, but I have a mirror.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Second time I've used a mirror to fuck up an enemy. It could be from your background. Could be.

Totally be. But yeah, I pull out my mirror and shove it in her face. I also call her really pretty.

I just tell her that she's very pretty.

[Speaker 1]
And she pulls out her strings herself. Go ahead and make me a... Are you being truthful or deceptive?

[Speaker 9]
Truthful.

[Speaker 1]
You're a fairy, so you could totally be truthful. I'm being truthful.

[Speaker 2]
She's very pretty and Charis would tell her that.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, go ahead and roll me a... Persuasion.

[Speaker 2]
Consume. Persuasion? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Persuasion. I'm just doing the opposite of the pet play. Is it the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Succubus?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to also add a... Minstrel Dice.

[Speaker 7]
Doesn't that version take damage if someone rejects them?

[Speaker 1]
Correct.

[Speaker 2]
Eat. I don't know what this does, but she needs to believe it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Her Petrifying Gaze is a little less active, especially now that she sees herself. So you guys are free to...

Do you guys want to keep attacking her or do you want to mess this up to you guys?

[Speaker 2]
I wouldn't particularly like to kill her. I would like to be unretrained, but...

[Speaker 1]
All right, Charis, you unfortunately do need to make a saving throw at the end of your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Constitution?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Pray, everyone, to whatever gods your characters believe in.

[Speaker 1]
Makes it.

[Speaker 2]
Yippee! Yay!

[Speaker 7]
That was close. If you didn't make it, I would have used my Herbalist Dice on you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, thank you. All right, and then Silk.

[Speaker 4]
So I'm restrained, which I think gives me disadvantage on everything, so I really don't want to attack. I'll just take the dodge action.

[Speaker 1]
All right, then, at the end of your turn, go ahead and make me another saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
On again?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yikes, that's bad.

[Speaker 3]
That is so bad.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to be petrified unless somebody has a weak means of intervention.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to reroll that with the Chronology subclass level 3 feature. I can't remember his name, but yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Can you have the Herbalist Dice? You can use...

[Speaker 4]
Well, is that better?

[Speaker 1]
You are still three off. Hold on.

[Speaker 6]
How many? 22?

[Speaker 1]
Just one.

[Speaker 4]
All right, 17 total.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm going to hold her. Restrain Goddard.

[Speaker 4]
Good work, team.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Yippee. Hold her.

[Speaker 1]
Play these dice. All right, let's see. I don't know why, but...

You're supposed to be surprised. All right, fuck it, that already happened. Rowan, surprise ends.

And then... Boggoth. There's literally only one alive now.

Only one of these guys alive now. This guy's going to do... Catapult on the axe that Kibi...

...used here. Yeah, okay. It's going to send it in a 60-foot line.

So first, Kibi, go ahead and make me a Dex save.

[Speaker 9]
Dex? That's correct.

[Speaker 5]
Got it.

[Speaker 1]
11. All right. All right, so that's just simple.

You take 16 force damage, plus... What is it? Is it D6?

Smoke, I see. Plus 4 slash damage. And top of the round, next round, Evelyn, go.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so we did not want to hurt the Midas too much, right?

[Speaker 2]
Hopefully her being told that she's too pretty to die here got her to leave.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, let's... I'm going to shoot this poor... ...this poor thing with the firebolt.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. If you hit, it dies.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah. What's your... A 12.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. That literally... Wait, does miss.

Do the little guys have less AC? They do not. That literally just misses.

Anything to confirm this action? Corpus.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 6]
One attack on this guy.

[Speaker 3]
Prince. Nice.

[Speaker 6]
It dies. Beautiful. And then my extra attack on this one.

Is it still alive?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Hasn't taken any damage yet.

[Speaker 6]
In that case... Where is it? Where is Forgeblows?

[Speaker 1]
Just place two unarmed attacks. And then you can subtract it upwards.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. Okay. It's at the end of your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. We bring us to DrBoxAI.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So... There are a couple creatures left, which is...

Right. So... Since we're going to go save things, just...

[Speaker 1]
Are you going to attack these guys?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I'm targeting the one closest to me over here. The bottom right one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. That is...

[Speaker 2]
Kibi! There's one... They're all down here, right?

[Speaker 6]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
Can't move. Okay. I will...

I will hit this guy.

[Speaker 1]
That's a 12.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, I can do it again. Kibi. Okay.

Damn, I tried. Shit. I don't want to use my action surge yet.

[Speaker 1]
You should have just... All right, the Medusa frees herself from her own... Restrained at the moment, and is in a slight delirium.

Paris, do you... Yeah, all right, this is going to be the end of combat. You guys can...

Kill us. Margaret is going to surrender.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Is she... Can she speak with us?

Is she, like... She doesn't want to kill us. She's not just, like, temporarily not wanting to kill us.

She just doesn't want to kill us now. She's temporarily not wanting to kill you guys. Okay, so let's get out of here.

I'll compliment her once more and lose.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Get back into formation.

[Speaker 5]
I'll just... Skedaddle to where you guys were, being like, hello! What's...

What's been happening?

[Speaker 2]
Long time no see.

[Speaker 5]
That's what it was. I've had a rather busy... Search season.

So, what is it that you're up to here in the caves?

[Speaker 2]
We are currently trying to find a dragon. What was the original... Why did we originally go after this dragon?

[Speaker 1]
They attacked you guys on your ship.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, right. I went so that, um... Paris went so that Kibi would stop pestering her, and then we got caught.

We got stuck in a tower. And now we're just going to kill this dragon to get it over with.

[Speaker 9]
Alright.

[Speaker 8]
Off we go, then. Out of, um...

[Speaker 5]
Just a question. Would the intern... The Mage Apprentice intern be on this trip, or...

Have I just left them to do their interning at home or something? They're like, pretty much like, sure.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Say hello to the intern. Ah.

[Speaker 1]
So, basically, Dr. Vasha, you would have come here looking for Darklings. You did find them. But you have not spoken with them as of yet.

They're on the west side in a small... Basically, a small caravan.

[Speaker 2]
Are you friendly with them? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
We'll find out. Mostly just got to chat because I am currently... Looking for one.

[Speaker 2]
Well, they're currently under the... What is it? There's a word.

I just took an Adderall. My brain should start working fairly soon.

[Speaker 1]
Brawl? Command?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Command. Of a blue dragon.

Um... So I don't know how... Friendly they'll be towards us.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, hold on. I didn't quite catch that. You have command of the blue dragon that you're hunting?

[Speaker 2]
The dragon has command over the Darklings. That's what they're called.

[Speaker 1]
Debating it.

[Speaker 5]
So... Yeah. I don't know.

I see. So, probably should deal with the dragon first before the Darkling. Or, we can...

[Speaker 2]
Having a chat with them. Have the Darklings turn on the dragon. I would not be opposed...

[Speaker 1]
In that case, you guys got two skills left to go here.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should totally go for the Darkling. Darklings. Um...

[Speaker 1]
You guys find... Let's see here. Left on the slip is also about...

250 gold. And 100 platinum pieces.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Hey. That's pretty good.

[Speaker 3]
How do you feel about short resting? Repeat that? That's a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are not in a position to short rest.

[Speaker 2]
Never mind. Let's move on.

[Speaker 1]
We got two skill checks remaining. You guys can either improvise something...

[Speaker 2]
What are we improvising for?

[Speaker 1]
Or grant skill checks to basically navigate safely and stealthily. You've already done stealth, obviously.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Are we just needing to go forward? Like, are we just needing to find the way?

Or... What is this skill check for?

[Speaker 1]
You guys are still in the middle of a skill challenge. The objective is to get there safely. Basically, well past the Quagoths.

The Quagoths, however you pronounce it. So that they cannot come back. So that you're out of range of their hunting parties.

Survival? Sure. What are you doing with survival?

[Speaker 9]
Ah...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, he hadn't thought of anything. So, next person to suggest.

[Speaker 2]
Um... So much... Are they coming towards us?

Like, do we know they're coming towards us?

[Speaker 1]
They were scattered across the area, right? And were advancing slowly towards the tower. You can see some parties that are just kind of sitting around or fortifying.

And you can see some parties that are just kind of in the area moving about. And you can't really see them consistently. Because they're moving behind these different little cracks and crevices.

Up the... You know, it's like up the side of a mountain. There are certain views that you're not going to be privy to.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I'd like to... I don't know if that passed or not. But I'd like to check to see if there's a clear path ahead.

That we can go to avoid all of these. With investigation.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, sure. So, you go a little bit further. And you're confident.

Let's say... You... Let's say, like, you go over to where the sled is.

And you see some of the tracks that are nearby. You notice that basically the sled is one of the last... Um...

Based on what you've seen so far. This sled is probably one of the last things that actually started going up. And you're able to figure out.

Okay, like... It seems like... You figure out that everything must have come from kind of like a central point going forward.

And so if there's anything at the bottom of this particular trail. If there's any quaggas remaining in the area. They're going to be at the bottom of this trail.

[Speaker 4]
Um... What about survival to cover our tracks? To try to leave no trace.

Or is that part of the stealth?

[Speaker 1]
That's already handled with stealth. And specifically pass without trace. Right.

[Speaker 2]
Any ideas?

[Speaker 5]
Well... The path we're blocked is... The path we want to go on towards is blocked by quaggas.

So we might have to...

[Speaker 1]
No, so if there's anything at the bottom of the... If there's any remaining, they're at the bottom of the trail here. So I'll say, for instance, you guys go further down.

Or closer to the lip edge of this area. And... It's not...

There are several spires. Sorry. So the dragon is in the center of these spires.

And... There's no obvious path to get like directly to the center. Because it's a giant fucking hole that has a few pillars in the middle.

You guys see an area that might lead... That seems like it goes a little bit... Or weaves a little bit closer to the dragon.

If you go lower. You see a path that goes further. That's sort of by you guys.

But will... Kind of goes straight down. And has a sign of a fortification nearby.

And then there's the end of the trail that you were originally on. That... Would have...

And then you see the end of the trail that you were originally on. Where you suspected if there are any quaggaths further along. They're going to be here.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go towards the fortification thing.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Works for me. Alright, and any skills from anybody?

[Speaker 9]
Uh...

[Speaker 5]
Guess looking for traps on the way.

[Speaker 9]
Which...

[Speaker 5]
Would be... That would just be a... Solid perception.

Oh, invest...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so...

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So more an investigation slash insight check. Okay.

No.

[Speaker 9]
No?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, just pure intelligence or whatever?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you have proficiency with thieves' tools, then...

[Speaker 5]
I have proficiency with thieves' tools, so I could also do it. Yeah, I do not have proficiency in thieves' tools, so...

[Speaker 2]
I can go ahead and do that, then.

[Speaker 5]
I could help modify it a bit, since it's to figure out a problem. One moment. Did you roll with intelligence?

Yes, you did. Okay. That would make it a 17.

[Speaker 1]
17, okay. You spot a... Again, you don't see the triggering mechanism, but you do spot a ring around this path or around this fortification.

You see a ring of repeating crossbows that don't appear to have an operator. They've been placed near shrubbery and near bird boxes in the area. What almost looks like birdhouses and shrubbery and other kind of trash.

That's just kind of been left in this area to camouflage it.

[Speaker 2]
I'll point that out.

[Speaker 5]
So, there is a potential crossbow trap in front of us? Yes.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
So, we're either dodging it or disabling it, since we can't exactly find its triggering mechanism. Should we attempt it? Or go on to a different, non-trapped path?

We could probably go around it. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Hold on, can you look through the invisible looking glass that you have on your scope? See if you can see anything there? Somebody has that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'll look through the scope. Yeah, nothing invisible, but I'll give you the opportunity to make a... Do you have thieves...

Yeah, you're a rogue. Go ahead and make me a thieves' tools based on wisdom.

[Speaker 4]
That's a 12.

[Speaker 5]
I can't modify that.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and is it a... Do you have expertise with thieves' tools?

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, I do. So that should actually be four higher, so that's a 16.

[Speaker 1]
16.

[Speaker 4]
Makes it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, it's based off a tiny little... There are two stones that are arrayed between... Basically, you look through and there's not a...

There's a little bit of, like, magical detection, or it just seems to glint a little bit more when you're looking through your magical scope. You see two stones, these little crystals, on the path. And you can see the thinnest invisible line between the two of them.

It's red. It's not a physical line, it's like... Okay, every fucking spy movie, where it's like this little laser sensor.

If you pass it, it triggers an alarm. That's what you see in front of you.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll point it out to the group.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you could literally just have them step over it.

[Speaker 2]
We will definitely do that then.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Down a little further, you guys... This is a tower, a very small drow outpost. It's only about...

Yeah, it's only two stories. And has a landing pad out the front. Doesn't have a barracks and doesn't have a...

Doesn't have a, quote, a hangar or stables. Which is what they use for their libraries. There are...

The top floor has about three... Sorry, about. Top floor has...

Eleven drow in the center. Just kind of milling about. Sharpening and polishing weapons.

Doing some maintenance on their... There's one guy who's doing maintenance on all the crossbows. About half of them are partially disassembled.

[Speaker 2]
What happens if you think... What do you think would happen if I waltzed in and acted like I was... I was contacted...

To come help? Do you think we'd just go through? Which character is this?

Chariz?

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
She's a fae, she's bright. I don't know if the dragon would have been like, Hey, there's this fairy bitch. So they drown as well.

Okay. Should we just pass the place?

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Chariz. So, I'm just... So every creature basically around here is in...

Are you suggesting we walk in? Maybe.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, in that case... Chariz is a fairy, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
You should sit on my shoulder.

[Speaker 2]
Like a parrot? Like a... Yes!

You want me to sit on you?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, you'll be the most convincing parrot ever.

[Speaker 5]
Why?

[Speaker 9]
So we're in a drought, but now we're having...

[Speaker 5]
A potential parrot situation? You know, maybe they draw one for comedy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we're gonna take a quick ten minute break here. While you guys figure out what the fuck you're doing.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I mean, do we even need to go through? We could also just go around. Yeah, probably.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are at the hole.

[Speaker 2]
What is happening to that? We're at the hole.

[Speaker 3]
We need to go through it to get to the dragon.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, Fallen, you don't want to know what's going on.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, I want to know, please. I drank some water. I'm not stupid anymore.

[Speaker 6]
Are you sure about that? Roll insight.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Uh, yes. So, cave, hole, dragon.

What? Just checking in.

[Speaker 5]
I'm probably... I'm just getting my directions mixed up. So, on one direction, it's the drought.

Which direction was the Darklings in? Ugh. Uh, west?

I have no idea.

[Speaker 1]
It's on the west side of the hole, guys. It's a fucking hole.

[Speaker 3]
Thanks. Oh my god. A hole.

I'll just... Yeah, he said... What?

Anyhoo.

[Speaker 5]
This is just amusing. Okay, so we're probably going to sneak past the drought area. My god, it's a hole.

[Speaker 6]
But we're going through the hole.

[Speaker 1]
It's a hole.

[Speaker 9]
We're going through the hole.

[Speaker 1]
You're not going through the hole. It's a hole. If you step off the hole, it will...

Alright, somebody message me when you guys...

[Speaker 4]
Alright, let's refocus. What's our main objective? Our main purpose for what we're doing today?

Kill the dragon?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Do we know where the dragon is relative to our position? Past the drought stronghold area.

Okay. So we know where the dragon is.

[Speaker 1]
The dragon is in the... The dragon is... Actually, I put it in...

Did I put it in out of character? No, I didn't put their positions... Oh, no I did.

So the Darklings are on the... West side. Over this way.

The dragon is in the center... Inside of a spire. So there's a bunch of little...

Mountains stretching up. This is a giant hole. And then it is broken up by a few spires...

That are stretching from the bottom of that hole... To ground level.

[Speaker 3]
Gotcha.

[Speaker 1]
You guys... Here.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Are there any preparations we need to make... Before we engage the dragon?

Does everyone feel like they're prepared? Sokh doesn't have any other preparations he needs to make for himself.

[Speaker 3]
Everyone is prepared. Two other people can get Unbuilding Bonded. It's a 1d4 once per turn.

Like worse, bless, but it... You know, saving throws and all of that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Does that need to be activated now? Is this a good time to do that?

[Speaker 3]
It has a 10 minute duration, no concentration. So this is a very good time to activate it. Who wants it?

Orpus.

[Speaker 5]
For the frontline fighters... Would anyone want invisibility? Because I can give the concentration to my intern.

[Speaker 4]
Anyone need invisibility?

[Speaker 6]
Orpus has rather good stealth, so that might not be a bad idea.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Charis is not a frontline. Well, she's kind of...

[Speaker 5]
She moves around. I could probably use her if I did that.

[Speaker 4]
You could use invisibility. Okay, cool.

[Speaker 5]
If you're going to punch the dragon in the face with a weapon, then invisibility yay or nay. Didn't know. Because...

Okay. So... Who was...

Who's a frontline fighter who wanted the invisibility?

[Speaker 6]
Orpus.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Kibi could also use it, probably.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, Kibi? Any other big...

[Speaker 4]
A 1d4. Any other big preparations to make? We've got emboldening bond.

We've got invisibility charges ready to go out. Just keep that in mind. Here's a big one.

[Speaker 1]
Are you guys trying to ambush the dragon here? Or are you trying to get to the dragon?

[Speaker 4]
Good question. So there's environmental things to consider now. We have a drow outpost, a drow settlement.

We have darklings. Do we want to just go fight the dragon where they stand? Do we want to lure the dragon out?

What is our overall strategy for this area? Just thinking about the placement of enemy resources. Oh.

There we go.

[Speaker 2]
It's very direct.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you, James.

[Speaker 3]
Very direct. I appreciate that. Okay.

Res, you've got a 1d4. Who else wants a 1d4?

[Speaker 5]
1d4... It's a 1d4 to check.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be there to check or a saving throw. The last one.

[Speaker 2]
I will give you a 1d4. What? Because I have...

[Speaker 6]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 3]
I have Bardic Inspiration.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but this lasts for 10 minutes and you get... And it recharges every turn. Not round.

So who wants it? Res gets one.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee. Keebee will take it.

[Speaker 3]
Keebee will take it. Yes. Nice.

Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
So we should probably make notes on who has what. So... Wording bond.

Yeah. Wording bond is on...

[Speaker 2]
Keebee, does 1d4 for a check? Like an attack or something?

[Speaker 4]
Once per turn...

[Speaker 3]
Once per turn, they can roll a d4 and add it to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. I would recommend using it on initiative and a potential saving throw.

[Speaker 4]
Just write down either in Discord or in Foundry if you're granting. Yeah, that's a really good practice. I think it's good for tracking that stuff.

[Speaker 2]
And the invisibility... Someone took that? Because if not...

[Speaker 4]
Res did, but they stepped away.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
So there is this... This is more just a preparation thing rather than giving someone else thing. Once we figure out where we're going to fight the dragon, I can summon a Draconic Spirit, which will probably help with the fight.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Does that need setup, or is that just right before the fight?

[Speaker 5]
No, it's right before the fight, but because it lasts a whole hour, I can summon it beforehand. But it is a kind of saying that you're there.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so when we're ready to fight, we'll make sure to use that. So what do we do about the dragon? Can't get to it where it is without flight.

So either we get flight, or we get it to move.

[Speaker 3]
We need it to come to us. Because I'm not flying down there alone. What if I place a Sickening Radiance on it?

Oh yeah. No, wait, wait, wait. Blue dragons have burrowing speed, if I remember correctly.

So I'm not doing that. It's a waste of a spell. I mean, how can we even kill it?

[Speaker 5]
It has a burrowing speed. Hit it enough times. Because once it burrows, it has to come out to hit us.

[Speaker 4]
It has to breathe sometimes. I think the idea is that it flees more than we can...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we can't really kill it completely. True, but it is a rescue mission, so... I mean, oh yeah, that's fair enough.

[Speaker 4]
Rescue mission, so it's not kill the dragon. We've already killed the dragon, he's part of it. You know what?

[Speaker 5]
I could try casting... I could attempt casting Polymorph on it. But again, those take actions, so...

[Speaker 4]
That's a case of... Do we have an objective other than killing the dragon?

[Speaker 2]
No, we've already completed the objective.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that's done. Survival is first.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, survival. Wait, hang on. The others have already been rescued?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we've already been rescued.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, sweet.

[Speaker 2]
I have a...

[Speaker 3]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
No, go ahead. Oh, I was saying the people that we came to rescue are with us in the party right now. Charis was part of the people that we came to rescue.

I see, I see.

[Speaker 3]
I have a one-way sleet storm.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Which, yeah. It's a third-level slot. So I could place that if it starts to fly.

And it doesn't even obstruct melee or anything. Because it only... yeah.

Are blue dragons territorial?

[Speaker 4]
I think we have a more basic question, which is... We're kind of talking about how do we keep it from fleeing and that kind of thing. I have a question, which is, how do we even engage it?

Do we want to try to get flight to fight it here? Or, if we don't want to fight it here, and we want to select a different setting and try to lure it away or something...

[Speaker 3]
How do we engage its interests? Do we have a bard? Yes.

Oh, we do have a bard! Oh my god, I was kidding. Can we have some...

maybe you can mock it or something?

[Speaker 6]
I was weird this whole time. Holy shit.

[Speaker 5]
I was asking, are blue dragons territorial? Because Draconic Spirit does mimic dragons, so...

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I need you to hear me out here.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Okay. So, you asked...

well, someone asked, I think it was Phineas? Or... Macaroni?

One of you asked, do we fight it here, or do we try and lure it somewhere else? And I vote we fight it here, reason being... It is a fucking dragon.

It is smart.

[Speaker 2]
We just don't want it to run away, right?

[Speaker 4]
It's gonna be difficult to trick it, that's it. It's gonna be hard to lure it, because it's smart, and it'll avoid that.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to use Hypnotic Pattern on it, because that would keep it. But in order to do that safely, I feel I should curse it first. So if we could keep it in one place long enough for me to curse it...

[Speaker 6]
Okay, but what's the benefit?

[Speaker 2]
The benefit is I can curse its intelligence, and then I can cast a spell on it so that it's easier to...

[Speaker 6]
No, what's the benefit of not killing it here and waiting?

[Speaker 2]
What are we waiting for?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we can't get to it.

[Speaker 4]
We need flight to get to it. Yeah, the tricky thing about this location is there's things that aren't the dragon that are here, like drow and darklings and things like that. And the dragon is in a place that is difficult to access here without flight.

[Speaker 2]
So why don't we focus on the drow first, then?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, let's deal with the drow, and the dragon will probably show its head.

[Speaker 5]
We can grab it and do something. Are we trying to convince the drow to be on our side?

[Speaker 2]
We could totally do that, because it might work, but then again, it might really backfire.

[Speaker 3]
You want to convince drow from the underground? Yeah, no, I was not saying convince drow. I said convince Medusa.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Medusa's gone. We left Medusa.

[Speaker 6]
On the subject of the drow, because they're the immediate problem, they're the immediate problem, I say that we don't want to persuade or intimidate. I think deception would be the smart play. Deceive them to do what?

[Speaker 2]
Can we bribe them? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Bribe them to what?

[Speaker 4]
Deceive them, saying that we want to deceive them into just leaving, right? We want the drow to leave the hole to the underdark and the drow settlement. We want to convince all of them to just give up this location.

[Speaker 6]
No, the... We want to deceive them to leave us alone. Okay, why would they do that?

Okay, why would they do that? We deceive them, saying that they're... Let us kill that dragon over there, because...

and what's the lie? Hold up, we don't even know if they want the dragon dead.

[Speaker 2]
They don't.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, they don't want the dragon dead, so that's a terrible... Yeah, sure, let's kill the fucking dragon. No, um...

[Speaker 4]
What is the point of the deception? To get the drow to just ignore that we're there and ignore that we're going to fight this dragon?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, and the way we'd accomplish that is to convince them, through deceptive means, that the dragon wants to see us.

[Speaker 3]
But then we can just sneak past them.

[Speaker 5]
We can just sneak past them.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and then we get hammer and anvil, except it's us that are getting hammered.

[Speaker 5]
Because once we lie, they'll know once we attack the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and then we would get hammered.

[Speaker 4]
You're talking about deceiving them to get access to the dragon. But the point is that we need to kill the dragon. So, like, if we deceive them and get access to the dragon and then fight and kill the dragon, they'll know that we're fighting the dragon and they'll attack us.

[Speaker 3]
And lie. I would also just like to put another, like, nail in the coffin of going to the dragon. Because if that thing has a lair, I would like to not be in it.

Yes. Lair actions. Yeah.

So where would we put it?

[Speaker 5]
Put what?

[Speaker 7]
As far away from the lair as possible?

[Speaker 5]
Since we don't want to give it lair actions, where would we fight it? We fight it...

[Speaker 4]
I think anywhere, like, an enclosed space is good. So that it has less opportunity to just fly away and, like, blast us from hundreds of feet away.

[Speaker 3]
I am less concerned about flying and more concerned about burrowing. If we have flight, then we have earthbind, sleetstorm, drip attack. You know, we have an easier time.

[Speaker 5]
The dragon actually has an advantage underground.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, underground is probably more favoring to the dragon. How do we deal with the burrow unless we fight in a place where it can't burrow?

[Speaker 3]
Burrowing speed doesn't work through rock, at least. Okay, so we can fight it in stone.

[Speaker 5]
How far deep are we underground?

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure.

[Speaker 4]
You mean, like, at present?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Or do you mean, like, how far down does this hole go?

[Speaker 5]
No, I was saying, how far down are we right now?

[Speaker 2]
That's a good question. Pretty far. We are...

so it says the drow settlement is at the bottom. We are at the drow outpost, I believe.

[Speaker 6]
Hey all, I've come up with an idea.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah?

[Speaker 6]
To deceive them to leave. We could rush in, Frogatha doing the talking. And Frogatha, you would be the...

You basically tell them, Hey, uh, dragon wants you to kill things. Out there, that way. At the same time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, and I can... No, no, no. Okay, hear me out, hear me out.

I shall adore myself in a T-Rex.

[Speaker 4]
Hello, violent, xenophobic, uh, underworlders. Us overworlders are telling you that the dragon that's over there told you to go over there and kill stuff.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, and we're gonna pull off a spectacle.

[Speaker 5]
You understand that's the oldest trick in the book, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, why don't you just say, Hey, there's a billion gold, but it's out of sight over there.

[Speaker 2]
We've established it's not a great idea. Let's find a new idea.

[Speaker 3]
We don't have too much time. Okay, let's just... Let's think about it this way.

Hold on. Fallen is saying something.

[Speaker 6]
We should try, at least try it the comedic way.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, yeah, sure, we can try. Backup plan.

[Speaker 1]
T-Rex... The comedic way was changing the plan for the session before it started.

[Speaker 4]
Uh...

[Speaker 3]
Dragon... T-Rex chomp chomp is the backup plan then.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that makes sense. So, question. Do we want to try to get the dragon somewhere else or do we want to try to fight it here?

[Speaker 3]
Somewhere else, but first we need to deal with the drow.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. What do we think we can... The drow are only an obstacle depending on how we want to lure the dragon.

So what do we think are possible... So we have multiple constraints here. One constraint is this dragon is licking its wounds and maybe doesn't want to fight at all.

Another constraint is the dragon's intelligence. So there's a bunch of stuff about the dragon. There's also stuff like the drow aren't going to just let us walk around here, right?

So I'm kind of interested in the dragon constraint right now. How do we even... Suppose there were no drow around here at all and this basin was totally empty except for the dragon.

How could we get this dragon out of here? How could we fight it somewhere else? Is there anything?

Is there any way to do that?

[Speaker 2]
Yell at it. Call it ugly. I could try mocking it.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any way to fly? Any way whatsoever? I can fly...

Okay, then we could turn you invisible and send you to steal something if it has a horde down there. The ring! The ring!

[Speaker 2]
It had a ring. Alright, the dragon has a ring. I can steal the ring.

And fucking haul ass.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and then mockery is a lot more effective since you essentially stole it on its nose, right?

[Speaker 4]
Dragons are greedy and prideful and we steal from it and it's mad because it's greedy and then we mock it and it's mad because it's prideful. What kind of flight do you have?

[Speaker 8]
I have...

[Speaker 2]
I'm a fairy, so I have... Oh, so... I have wings.

So I just need invisibility and then I can take the ring and hopefully not die in one hit because I have 46 hit points at the moment.

[Speaker 3]
Do dragons have blindsides?

[Speaker 4]
Yes, but only out to like 30 or 60 feet.

[Speaker 5]
So where are we luring it to? Wherever we are in this.

[Speaker 4]
To us, right?

[Speaker 2]
Like, right here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Try to fight it at the outpost. Just get it to attack us.

[Speaker 2]
And we can take hostages, too. I think Kibi is going to definitely take hostages.

[Speaker 3]
How... How far down are we right now? From the surface?

[Speaker 4]
I think we're near the top. At or near the top.

[Speaker 1]
No, just at or near the top. You guys have gone inwards a little bit to like... You're at like the shelf, basically, of this place.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Here's my worry with the luring the dragon thing. Dragon is in Licking Wounds mode.

We already... Dragon has already had its ass kicked. Dragon has multiple factions here.

Drow and Darklings. And even if we do manage to piss it off, I'm worried it'll just say, Hey, Drow and Darklings, go kill those guys. And the dragon won't burst itself.

[Speaker 2]
So should we go to the Dark... Should we just bypass the Drow, go to the Darklings, and... Okay.

We should... You needed to speak to the Darklings anyway. Do you have an in with the Darklings, Dr. Bashir?

[Speaker 5]
No, this was more of a request to find someone. So I don't have an in with them...

[Speaker 9]
Yet.

[Speaker 5]
Really? So this... I don't have a way to properly convince them besides regular means.

So, no.

[Speaker 6]
I feel like we're all just overthinking this. And the most direct approach is the most effective here. Fly down and kill him?

[Speaker 2]
How many Drow are in this outpost?

[Speaker 4]
Owen and Murder.

[Speaker 2]
How many Drow are in this outpost?

[Speaker 4]
There's three different things to murder here. There's four different things to murder here.

[Speaker 7]
I will say this. During all this discussion, Rowan will be keeping an eye out. Okay.

Just to make sure nothing sneaks up on us while a strategy is being made.

[Speaker 3]
We saw Eleven drown on the top floor. Opinion on invisibility. Steel Ring.

Come here. If it sends the Drow and stuff, we kill the Drow. But we make sure we have an exit so that we can run if necessary.

It's a rescue mission. We have already rescued people. If we have the ability to live to fight another day, that's fine.

[Speaker 6]
I really think we're just overthinking this. And we kill the Drow. You're overthinking everything.

[Speaker 1]
The number of details I heard that were wrong in the past half hour were hysterical.

[Speaker 2]
How many Drow are there?

[Speaker 1]
There's Eleven in this top room here. Okay. We're going to kill them all.

Karis does have a...

[Speaker 9]
Hi.

[Speaker 1]
It regards to your... Because I don't know if you wrote this down on the weapon itself. You do have advantage on reaction rolls.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Let's go kill the Drow. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. So kill the Drow in the outpost, right? That's what we're saying.

[Speaker 9]
That's step one.

[Speaker 4]
Let's just do that. Get that out of the way. Cross off the to-do list.

The only thing I want... I'd like to know is an exit strategy. Because we've got roving bands.

Or whatever they were called.

[Speaker 2]
They're already headed out towards the tower. So I think we're good on that front.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. So we have like a vector of retreat that isn't going to put us into that path.

[Speaker 2]
We have two minutes until a random encounter. So we just need to go in and fight these fucking Drow. Yeah.

Out of character.

[Speaker 6]
You've seen the 1987 Predator. Out of character. You've seen the 1987 Predator.

Why are you...

[Speaker 1]
Dude, why are you... We're attacking. Stop.

Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and add yourself to the combat account.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go in. I'm going to enter through the top. If there's a top way.

Sure. With Karis. Like a window.

[Speaker 4]
Are you flying or just climbing?

[Speaker 2]
Flying.

[Speaker 4]
Flight's a level 3 spell if you're doing it.

[Speaker 2]
No, I just... I have wings. I'm a fairy.

[Speaker 4]
That's even worse. I was going to say... Because I only have level 2 spells.

But ma'am, maybe when I get level 3 I can do fly. You just get it all the time.

[Speaker 2]
I do. Although my initiative isn't great. But I could have already been flying up that way anyway.

[Speaker 9]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to use the bathroom really quickly. I'll be right back. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Good call. Should probably do it this way.

[Speaker 3]
Reminder to those who had a molding bond. You can add a 1d4 to initiative. If you want to.

No. I don't want to.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, right. So that would be 17. Completely forgot about that.

Thanks for reminding me.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Did you use a 1d4 to initiative?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I asked the... Oh. Forgot.

The other person. Did you add a 1d4 to initiative? Oh.

No, I didn't. I thought it was an attack. Okay.

It's two. It's once per turn. But it's an attack, ability check, or saving throw.

I do. Yep. It's a bit too late.

[Speaker 2]
It's 1d4.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know how to update my initiative.

[Speaker 1]
I can do it for you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Well, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Gibby goes to a... That was for Karis. Oh, for Karis.

Okay. It doesn't actually... Yeah, it doesn't actually change her position here.

Starts with... Oh, wow. Evelyn.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Fireball. All of them.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. You wouldn't be able to catch them all in a fireball.

[Speaker 3]
Yep. I will just roll 86. Can you ping it in the chat?

[Speaker 1]
That makes it a lot easier.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Here we go. Evelyn.

Fireball. And damage. 56.

28. DC 15. Dex save.

Wow. Wow! What the fuck?

[Speaker 2]
Those were just people passing and failing. There were no nat 20s or anything there for crits.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think there were any nat 20s. Actually, wait, no. There was one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
There was one.

[Speaker 2]
The first dracultist. Oh, and the second dracultist.

[Speaker 1]
Why? That's funny.

[Speaker 3]
Goddamn. Pain. Really, really good at, like, not...

Okay. So, 28 damage. Half.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[Speaker 9]
And...

[Speaker 1]
No matter for those guys, because they don't have enough hit points this way. By the way...

[Speaker 2]
Do they take fire damage at the end or beginning of their round?

[Speaker 3]
No, they take fire damage now. Unless it's proper fire. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
It's not an extended thing.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool. And then... Can I walk backwards here?

Or, like, what's the... How much...

[Speaker 1]
If you just want to, like, flee backwards, yeah, that's totally fine. Not really doing...

[Speaker 3]
How much? Like... Okay, I'll just...

No.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 9]
Cool.

[Speaker 5]
I'll get my intern to fireball them. Which is just... These guys are having a bad day.

And... I... Depending on if they die or not, I will also just fireball them.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is most of them gone. Okay. Is there anything else worth your turn here?

[Speaker 5]
Then, I guess, just... One more fireball. Because, why not?

Yeah, good measure.

[Speaker 3]
Clear it now. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
This time it's me casting it.

[Speaker 3]
Control is overrated anyway. Just... Death is the best control.

[Speaker 5]
So, say it. Open heart, man.

[Speaker 6]
I really like this whole murder idea.

[Speaker 5]
I don't. I really don't like this murder idea. What level is the apprentice, by the way?

It's a 5th level Mage Apprentice. Cool. Alright, so I guess they just prepared fireball for the day?

[Speaker 8]
Yep. Alright.

[Speaker 5]
That and silvery barbs, because it's easy enough, but I'd forgotten about it earlier. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, and they do it at additional levels per day. Yes, they have two spells that they can do. So the next one will be silvery barbs.

Very nice. Okay. Anything that Dr. Banshee is doing?

[Speaker 5]
No, besides being a little annoyed at the whole murder thing. That's it, I don't have any more.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you cast a fireball yourself. Yeah. Oh, okay.

I don't think that they... Did you roll damage?

[Speaker 9]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. Neither of them can survive that, so they're toast as well.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yeah. Is that all of them?

[Speaker 1]
That's all the ones on this floor.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there were more?

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Multiple floors, it sounds like.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, can I sneak down... Oh, wait, are we still in combat? No.

Can I stealth down and just see if I can... Well, I flew up towards the top, didn't I? Meaning I'm on a different floor.

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 2]
No? Okay, so there's no...

[Speaker 1]
Going through a window on this floor, I assume.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, yeah. Can I sneak to another... I'm gonna stealth to another place, just to see how many people are on that floor.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, there's a stairwell, and then there's another window that you can go to. Which one do you go?

[Speaker 2]
Window.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So I'll do it for this. Six of them, they're rolling with advantage.

That's six of them, so three of them are taking the health action. Two of them are held.

[Speaker 2]
Am I getting shot? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Winning five bolts each. Alright, which of those hit?

[Speaker 2]
All of them.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Any more classic drow sleeping poison on their handcrafts?

[Speaker 1]
No, they didn't get a chance to apply it just yet.

[Speaker 2]
I think I did that to the wrong person.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I assume the sound of combat...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, she's down, I'm pretty sure. Okay. Damage...

Damage... yeah, I'm down. Does somebody have Feather Fall?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. I dropped this Feather Fall feature.

[Speaker 1]
One death save. As you hit the ground.

[Speaker 5]
Can I... grab her with Maytand or something?

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, no, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Give her a high five if she's falling, maybe. One of the guys, are you...

You guys, what are you doing?

[Speaker 2]
Um... I... Kibi is going to...

at least try to... I have Field Medicine. Is that...

can that help her?

[Speaker 3]
I have Heating Word.

[Speaker 1]
Don't even know where she fell.

[Speaker 2]
Improvised healing.

[Speaker 4]
You guys are on the clock right now.

[Speaker 1]
You guys... If you're doing something, make a decision.

[Speaker 2]
I need healing, so...

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so Kibi goes down, she's going to climb down and attempt to do some improvised healing. How many dice are you committing to this?

[Speaker 2]
Um... Five.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And how much... Do you have a Healer's Kit?

You do, you do. Somebody gave you a Healer's Kit. Lucent did.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so that's... That's... Five...

D... Eight. Twenty-six.

I think that... Yeah, that works.

[Speaker 1]
Equal to the damage they last took. Okay, so she's got... Nineteen temporary hit points.

And... Five actual hit points. The rest of you, what are you doing?

[Speaker 4]
Um... I want to go... You said there were stairs, right?

[Speaker 9]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
I want to go look up the stairs and see... They're down. Okay.

[Speaker 9]
You guys are on the top floor.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Go down the stairs... Or go to the stairs and listen and see if I hear any activity.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, you listen...

[Speaker 1]
And make the Perception check. Twenty-seven. You hear the striking of...

It's very quiet shuffling, but you hear the striking of torches and sparklers.

[Speaker 9]
Ah!

[Speaker 1]
I think my idea is it was sparklers. Or flares.

[Speaker 2]
Can I cure wounds myself at this point?

[Speaker 1]
You've already attempted something at the moment. But the other people cycle... Except at the start of the next minute.

Okay. What are people doing?

[Speaker 6]
So... I'm going to go down the stairs because I'm invisible. And I'm going to make a Stealth check to...

Keep my footsteps quiet.

[Speaker 4]
How about that?

[Speaker 3]
One D4.

[Speaker 4]
Do we still have Paths Without Trace? Maybe.

[Speaker 3]
I would not have... Oh, no. Okay.

Rest, you can have the D4.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are like several hours ahead of time now.

[Speaker 9]
I'll make myself suspicious.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So they will have disadvantage on these attacks. I'd see you.

Be just 6 and 3.

[Speaker 6]
They need to beat 19. Well, they need to hit 19.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let me just pop this out.

[Speaker 6]
One hit.

[Speaker 1]
Just one.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make a... Constitution saving throw. DC is 13.

DC is 13.

[Speaker 6]
22.

[Speaker 1]
Thank God. You take 19 damage.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Alright. Sounds like we're fighting.

So, Silk will go down. And open fire.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. There are 6 Drow and 1 Quagga. We need a little circle.

The question mark shape. Or question ball shape on his head.

[Speaker 4]
Which one... What looks beefier? The Drow house captain or the Quagga?

[Speaker 1]
I was just using the house captain as a proxy. There's just 6 warriors down here with the... I don't know.

You guys are going to have to kill them first.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. That's fair. I'll take aim at the...

[Speaker 1]
You know you could kill the Quagga with one shot, probably.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Okay. Maybe shop with the hireling.

I'm going to fire at the Drow. At one of the Drow warriors. And this is just going to be...

I think a regular... I'll have... I'll have Haleth help, I guess.

Okay. So that will give me advantage. For 34 damage.

Alright. That's Silk's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Anybody else want to do anything? I'm going to cure wounds. That's fine.

Go ahead and roll your dice. Evelyn?

[Speaker 3]
I would like to... Pasha?

[Speaker 1]
Pika?

[Speaker 3]
I'd like to Pika. See what's going on while taking the dodge action, probably.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So I can get an aggressive...

[Speaker 3]
Down. Yeah, so I can see the... Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
See the map.

[Speaker 3]
How close are they to each other?

[Speaker 1]
They're within a tight... They're not directly right next to each other. They've kind of scattered themselves out on purpose.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Yeah, then I'll walk back. Probably.

[Speaker 1]
Rowan, are you doing anything?

[Speaker 7]
I will activate Symbiotic Entity to get myself a whole bunch of temp HP.

[Speaker 1]
Since, hey, battle's happening. Might as well get my defenses. Hey, Corpus.

You walked down. You got hit by a few bolts. You're not invisible as of yet, though.

Would you like to... Are you doing anything? Did it for...

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. And you know, real quick, how far away could I make it?

[Speaker 1]
No, you could hit them. What do you want to do?

[Speaker 6]
Okay. I'm going to walk up and Stein Strike to... Depending on how close they are, to Drow.

[Speaker 1]
You just roll your attacks.

[Speaker 6]
Lovely.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee's also going to attack, but I'll do that after.

[Speaker 6]
Can I get advantage since I'm invisible? I think so.

[Speaker 1]
Keebee, you are...

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Oh, yeah, I'm at the bottom. Never mind.

Keebee's at the bottom.

[Speaker 1]
Here's the thing. You're at the bottom, but there's a door there. It's locked, but if you're having trouble getting through it...

You're on the same floor as the rest of these guys right now.

[Speaker 9]
And...

[Speaker 6]
EC's 18.

[Speaker 1]
18? Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Because of my belt.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Try... You should definitely apply your bonuses to that.

[Speaker 7]
I'm pretty sure it would automatically apply it if you import through plutonium.

[Speaker 1]
It depends on the...

[Speaker 6]
And these are being made against separate targets.

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
So one is stunned, and how about the other?

[Speaker 1]
Not stunned.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. And I'm going to use my bonus action to... Not do anything.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Keebee. Get a locked door next to you.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I could... I could smash it.

Maybe. With my sword?

[Speaker 1]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Let's see if I can... Make a...

[Speaker 1]
Probably make an athletics check, and then just add a plus one to it.

[Speaker 2]
Athletics, plus one. Athletics... 15, 16?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Yeah, you're able to just, like, put the sword in there and then wedge it.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. He's behind this door.

[Speaker 1]
It is the scene I was describing to you earlier. There's a bunch of drow in here.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'm going to rage.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you still have an attack left.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Let's do that. Um...

Rage... I assume I shouldn't do that. I'm going to go to the closest one.

[Speaker 9]
That misses.

[Speaker 2]
Is that it? Okay, um... I'm going to action surge.

When I can find it.

[Speaker 1]
Are you recklessing, or are you going with...

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I'll reckless. Okay. I'll attack again.

So that's a 22 to hit.

[Speaker 1]
That definitely hits. Get an extra d12 on these.

[Speaker 2]
Oh... Extra d12. Slash roll...

d12. Yeesh. Um, and then...

That was my second attack, because opening the door was my first one. So then I will action surge... And do it again.

One more attack. Wait, since I already have two attacks...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, then you get two attacks. Action surge gives you another two.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You got it right.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'm assuming I get both of those, a 19 and a 20.

[Speaker 9]
Mhm.

[Speaker 2]
And that's an extra d12 on each?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, anything that... Whenever you roll with advantage, you get an extra d12.

[Speaker 2]
And then I'll roll... The plus ten is for the nine. So that's a 19...

And a 23.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and the previous one was... And then you... Right, right, okay.

[Speaker 9]
Alrighty. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
And then... Start of the Dr. Masha still does not go on.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, okay, well... I'll... Rowan is...

Is Rowan in the middle of...

[Speaker 9]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Just a bunch of drow stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, okay. No, it's not representative of the battle map.

[Speaker 5]
It's just...

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I'll... Hm. I was asking is...

Yes, I know, sorry. I was wondering what Rowan exactly was doing there, because I'd probably...

[Speaker 1]
He's not doing anything. It's very simple. There's a bunch of enemies here.

You guys can... Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, alright. A bunch of enemies there.

[Speaker 1]
As many as you want, wasting time.

[Speaker 5]
It's just... Alright.

[Speaker 1]
I'll fireball again.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, I'll... Go down to where Kibi is and help with that. No, not enough space.

That then... Oh, that did not cast. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Hm, it's not casting. Is it a concentration? What are you trying to cast?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it is a concentration. That's why I can't cast it, you're right. Never mind, I'll just do some...

Magic missile then. Okay. On we go.

Barricade and roll damage. Okie dokie.

[Speaker 2]
I was only asking about the concentration, because I remember hearing something about things not casting when it has concentration. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Is it a glitch?

[Speaker 2]
Because I was having... Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 5]
I was having that issue too. I did not roll them separately, but just add a plus one to each of the dice. What's the total?

Uh, the total would then be ten.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that kills one of them. Okay. Okay, and we got...

[Speaker 3]
We're not doing any kind of initiative, right?

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna add you guys to initiative now. At this point it will be faster.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you. Thank you indeed.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, firebolt. Attack, which is the first one I see. Twenty three.

Hits, I assume. Damage. Sixteen damage.

[Speaker 1]
Sixteen, okay. Looking pretty rough. Who is next?

Ooh, that's the wrong screen there. That's annoying. Dr. Basha.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Easy enough. Just... That's the wrong screen.

Not again.

[Speaker 1]
Another fireball, okay. That guy is... And the other two are stunned and fail automatically, so all of them fail.

Which means three of them are dead. Sorry, two of them are dead. In addition to the earlier one, which brings us to Corpus.

[Speaker 6]
Slash. Slash.

[Speaker 1]
Still alive. What did you...

[Speaker 6]
Attack.

[Speaker 1]
Nah man, what the fuck did you get?

[Speaker 6]
Twenty one, twenty one. Eleven, twenty.

[Speaker 1]
Eleven and twenty, okay, that kills two.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect. Flurry of Blows on the third, to unarmed.

[Speaker 1]
If you hit, you will kill it.

[Speaker 6]
Dead. Seventeen.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's the end of combat.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna heal myself once more. Using my last fourth level slot. Actually, wouldn't it be fifth level?

[Speaker 1]
Now in a spot where you can get into a short rest if you wish.

[Speaker 6]
Lovely.

[Speaker 3]
Yes please.

[Speaker 1]
Yes please.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, ritual cast Tiny Hut. And in case of Dispel Magic, I'm going to ritual cast it... I'm going to ritual cast it once and then cast it normally once as well.

So layer two of them. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I have this, so since we're short resting, Song of Rest.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Song of Rest.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, what level? What level is Cerys?

[Speaker 2]
Level ten.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, so one D8.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, why are you asking?

[Speaker 6]
Uh... Because the extra points increases to a D8 at ninth level and etc. etc.

So I was wondering what level she was.

[Speaker 1]
But that's not what she is. Dicetotal's already been rolled.

[Speaker 2]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
Two levels in Rogue?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, two levels in Rogue. And level eight Bard.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So just go with the roll there.

[Speaker 2]
Right, so Bard eight.

[Speaker 1]
Don't ask a question and then... Again, that question behind the question thing is like, hey, is that total accurate? Okay, there is loot in here.

Crossbows are no longer usable, because they've been fireballed to shit. However, there is still gold and other end coinage on them.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Dragontide.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Phineas, go ahead and... Or I guess any of the rogues, really. Go ahead and make me some...

Investigation checks? Yeah, investigation checks.

[Speaker 2]
Investigation... Um... Regardless of if we kill the dragon or not, Caris is leaving after this mission.

She's going back to the gate. Not a bad idea.

[Speaker 4]
Looks like Silk and Caris have both rolled. What were your totals?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I got a 22 and Silk got a 16.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so the fires did set off some flares. Inside of the, uh... Inside of your outpost here.

[Speaker 2]
Are those reinforcements for help?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, probably not good. Alright, let's get out of here.

[Speaker 2]
After our rest, we need to skedaddle quickly.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Um... The next...

[Speaker 4]
Silk and Caris.

[Speaker 2]
The next, uh... Place? Did we find, um...

We probably don't have time to search the place.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I mean, there's the galls.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Um, Kibi's gonna search around. Also have to short rest Kibi. Okay, I'll roll one.

Put dice on my vest. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, Rowan will also be looking around.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Sign.

[Speaker 1]
You guys find a map that indicates... It goes to a supply cache. In need of, you know...

It looks like some of the drow were stowing away... Does anybody... Somebody here speaks Elvish.

Sure. I'm pretty sure I do. Silk is an elf.

Exactly. So you find... It looks like they were storing away some gold in order to avoid the, um...

In order to avoid the dragon taking all of it. And you find about... It's not as if...

You find... 1,250 gold for the sake of this week's back pay.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Great.

[Speaker 7]
Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
So, what's next on the, um... On the, uh... The trail?

[Speaker 8]
There is no trail.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are at the edge of the hole. And being a hole... There is open, empty...

Mostly empty air... Between you guys and the, uh... Where the dragon's nest is.

[Speaker 2]
The darklings... We can, um... If the darklings and the dragon attack, we can...

I still have my... My, um... Enemies abound.

And bestow curse. But I can only do it once. Because I am out of 4th level.

[Speaker 3]
So that's... Do we, um... How do we like the idea of someone flying in and stealing something the dragon likes?

I am...

[Speaker 2]
I'm less, uh... Wanting to do that now. Because Charis has no hit dice left.

And is, like... She's only got 63 hit points. So if that fails, she dies.

And she stays in a place where nobody can get her. Because nobody else has wings.

[Speaker 7]
I am... Not liking my odds of getting out of there alive. Even if I had my...

My druid turn into a goddamned skeleton and flew down there to steal something.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. So... We don't...

Agree with the stealing option. I think.

[Speaker 7]
Right. Too large odds of, uh... Dying horribly.

So, uh... We just attack it? Yeah, we just attack.

[Speaker 5]
How far down is this hole?

[Speaker 1]
Miles and miles and miles.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, so don't jump down the hole.

[Speaker 1]
Got it. The Underdark. The world below.

[Speaker 4]
So think of how dark... Think of where the dark is, and it's, like... Even farther below that.

It's under the dark.

[Speaker 9]
Hilarious.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Thank you. How much do you like El?

There's a hole that tries to imitate it. So, I kind of see two options. One is circle around and try to kill the darklings.

And the other one is, like... Direct engagement. Just, like, engage the dragon and, like, see what happens.

See if it wants to try to attack us in the outpost. Or some kind of subterfuge with the dragon. Since, uh...

Since we're not a big fan of sending in our flier.

[Speaker 3]
What if I polymorph you into something which can fly and has more hit points? How many hit points? Let's see, I'm thinking those winged creatures.

How many hit points do those have? Like, the dinosaurs?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, the best flying creature is, like, the cryogelosus or whatever and has 30 hit points. Okay, so that would be 30 on top of that.

[Speaker 3]
I cannot pronounce it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, would I keep my stealth modifier? Sleight of hand and all that? Because I only have a plus 5 in sleight of hand.

So I don't know if I can steal it without them knowing.

[Speaker 3]
Even if you don't, you can maybe get it out. Like, you know, dragon reacts, but you fly away with it.

[Speaker 5]
Quetzals also have flyby, so...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, very nice.

[Speaker 2]
So I can just grab it with the flyby?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, because you won't trigger opportunity attacks.

[Speaker 2]
And what's the flight speed? Because I don't want to... 80 feet.

Okay. I could probably outfly the dragon. Or at least keep up with it.

[Speaker 7]
The only problem is, what about the breath weapon?

[Speaker 4]
Right. Do we even know where its ring is?

[Speaker 3]
No, but the ring is in Suddenstone. We just need something it cares about.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so there's a ring on its finger, but I think the idea was that, like, hey, we're basically going to... Yeah, is that accurate?

[Speaker 3]
Something from the Horde. And be like, oh yeah, we stole it under your nose.

[Speaker 4]
And it's like on its horde, right? Dragons like to sleep, like, actually on their horde. Is that right?

Yeah, because it gives them...

[Speaker 2]
God, I really don't like this idea. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, what I'm thinking is, maybe mage hand. Instead of risking... Do we still have the goats?

Because my mage hand increased to 120 feet. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, you could... Rider like a horse could help. Flying mount if you want to do the long distance thing, rather than just a snatch and grab.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not liking the idea of my character going down there, and possibly not. Because once you go down there, if you don't have... There's no way to get out if you don't have flight speed, and if my character goes down, nobody else has flight speed.

[Speaker 8]
That's it.

[Speaker 3]
I have room.

[Speaker 7]
What? That's contingent on wild shape or polymorph.

[Speaker 3]
I have mage hand, which I can make invisible due to telekinetic. It has a 60 foot range. Someone with a flight speed could grapple me, like, kind of dangle me down, so we're within 60 feet of it.

I could grab it, and then we could fly away.

[Speaker 5]
I get... Hold on, how long is it? No, it would run out before it goes down.

Never mind.

[Speaker 2]
Question about our security at the moment. There's probably reinforcements incoming while we're speaking. Is there a place we can get out of here and hide while they're approaching?

[Speaker 4]
Leave the drow outpost and circle around the hole, maybe?

[Speaker 5]
Could I send the draconic spirit down to go do it? Would it last long enough to go down and come back up? Doesn't this last for like an hour?

It does, but I don't know. It said miles and miles.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Well, when you say... Wait, what do you mean, go down?

Where are you going?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, to provoke the dragon.

[Speaker 1]
The dragon is not down. The dragon is in a spire at the center of the hole. It's by the top part.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
The only thing that's not in the top part... The problem is that you still have to fly to figure out some other solution or to get over there. At the moment, you guys can...

Just have a few options. You can retreat back to the tower. You can risk random encounters here, which will happen.

Especially now that the flares and such have been set off.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should retreat.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Yeah, I like retreating instead of just me shooting at the portions of current locations. I could wild ship into a giant eagle and carry people across.

[Speaker 1]
Do it. You can carry a person across. Where are you putting them?

Maybe a person plus Karis. Or do we have any other kind of people?

[Speaker 5]
I can't believe that's it.

[Speaker 4]
I could cast Alter Self on myself. To make yourself smaller?

[Speaker 2]
I'm kind of wanting Karis to retreat. Because I want to get back to the gate. But I could leave Kiwi here.

Okay.

[Speaker 4]
What's the approximate diameter or radius of the hole? Well, the Hex is 24 miles wide.

[Speaker 1]
I would say that the tower itself is probably about 3 miles in. It's more like a depression first, and then a crater, and then the actual hole. The drop-off.

Coastal shelf, if you will. Probably, yeah, 3 miles. And probably another mile down from there.

Maybe even... Yeah, depending on the area. Anywhere from 3 to 5 miles from the edge.

So the actual hole section is going to be somewhere between 10 to 14 miles across.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, because of the bug call, I have to step away.

[Speaker 1]
No, Flyer is actually not going to have... Especially if it has a more significant fly speed, it's actually not going to have that dime. Yeah, Giant Eagles have an 80 feet fly speed.

Right, so you consider what a fast march for a Giant Eagle is, I guess.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, Macaroni.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Hold on, guys, vote and make a decision on something now.

[Speaker 6]
Eagle plan.

[Speaker 1]
Get one vote in favor of the Eagle.

[Speaker 3]
So, what, you carry someone over there and you try to fight them, or do you just try to steal?

[Speaker 7]
I do not think the stealing plan will work out very well. Mostly because it is a plan that's liable to get, well, a lot of us killed.

[Speaker 3]
So you're attacking the two of you.

[Speaker 7]
No, carry people across one by one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, and then everyone who gets carried across...

[Speaker 5]
It's on top of a spire. Okay, retreating.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, retreat. When you say carry across, you said, well, we're not going to attack it, we're not going to try to steal something from it, we're just going to carry ourselves across. So what is that?

[Speaker 6]
Well, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Just speak in a complete fucking sentence, please. Here's what I understand. Okay, subject, verb, the whole thing.

Give me the whole package.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, Mecharoni carries people across to where the dragon is. The people who get carried across fight the dragon and hold it off until the other people get carried across.

[Speaker 3]
But it's miles across. And in its own lair. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
So we probably need to come back with actual tools.

[Speaker 3]
We need to retreat for the day.

[Speaker 1]
Retreat, yeah. Three, four, I think we have four in favor of retreat now, so...

[Speaker 3]
How thick is the pillar in the middle? Above. Like, the existing pillar.

[Speaker 1]
When you say how big it is, what are you...

[Speaker 3]
How thick, like, how thick...

[Speaker 1]
Like, how big around, or... How thick across? Probably, yeah, yeah, like a few hundred feet at least.

What were you thinking, Chance, you rock to mud?

[Speaker 3]
No, I was just thinking, like, if we could possibly disturb it to, like, send an entire structure cracking down.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

[Speaker 3]
That's why I was thinking, I've done that before, I was thinking, oh, rock to mud.

[Speaker 2]
We could just take the whole spire down.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, are there any creatures who can, like, because I still have Polymorph, who can, like, break rock well? I mean, that's Cayman language, but, like, still... I have Erupting Earth.

[Speaker 5]
That? Sure.

[Speaker 3]
You're supposed to do it. But it's a few hundred...

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to get, like, every single square inch of it, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we need to create, like, a big... Oh, what else? Okay.

Try, yeah. I think, uh...

[Speaker 4]
If you transmute it, you could, um...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I... I do have Transmute Rock.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just transmute, could you turn it into mud?

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
It looks like a very thin layer of mud, and if you did it at an angle, it might start sliding.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So, are we fighting the dragon via transmuting, rocking its spire?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right now you guys are retreating. This is a hypothetical discussion because...

[Speaker 5]
So, this is for next time. This is for the next time. Alright, cool.

So we are retreating.

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
So you guys get back to the tower. You are not molested on the way, you do see a lot of petrified quaggoths, and nightfalls, which means there are drow about. Yeah, you guys do make it back to the tower.

Okay, is there anything, I guess the thing to think about now is how do you defend the tower?

[Speaker 2]
Well, we have a nice capable wizard and a bunch of capable people.

[Speaker 1]
Any judgments I make in favor of capability here are going to be probably halved or quartered, or maybe even tenthed.

[Speaker 2]
Why?

[Speaker 3]
So it's like a siege?

[Speaker 9]
That's not really fair.

[Speaker 7]
If I see drow broaching, I will just fire off erupting earth from the windows.

[Speaker 5]
I can probably dump out the skeletons I have as long as you're- to just make sure none of them sneak up on us.

[Speaker 4]
Here's a weird question. Are illusions visible in the dark? Like, do they generate- they don't generate light, but are they themselves visible?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
If a creature had darkvision, for instance, they would be able to see an illusion. What I'm asking is, suppose you don't have darkvision, so you're looking out, black as night, and then I create- like, suppose Sylk created a big red arrow pointing down at an enemy at that illusion. If you didn't have darkvision, would you see the illusion, or would it- no, you need- there's no light being shed on the illusion, so it's effectively invisible.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think you would have to- yeah, I don't think it would break the normal vision rules.

[Speaker 2]
Can anyone prepare daylight?

[Speaker 8]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Because if we do daylight, we just send out a daylight sphere. The drow, I think they have sunlight sensitivity, right?

[Speaker 1]
It needs to be sunlight.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, daylight isn't sunlight, right? Isn't that just a quirk of 5th edition?

[Speaker 5]
I know, it's so annoying.

[Speaker 4]
Natural language! I think there's a higher level version that's supposed to be extinguishable. Like, sunburst and sunbeam.

[Speaker 1]
Sunbeam make a- I'll be back later. You guys can take about a 15-minute break here, and then we'll be back to figure out what's going on. If you guys are- basically, if you guys are fleeing, or if you are keeping the tower there, or what.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I think the tower dies. If the wizard dies, the tower disappears.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Right! You guys had wizard-like hostages or something. What was up with that?

One of them is a hostage.

[Speaker 2]
The other is the actual owner of the tower. He was a hostage, but he wasn't our hostage. He was the- our current hostage held that wizard hostage.

We freed that wizard, and now the other wizard is hostage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so you are now friends with this wizard you freed, yeah?

[Speaker 3]
The owner of the tower, yes. Let's check if he has any spells, maybe, wide enough to make cracks and, you know, yeah, do that plan. Right now we need to focus on the siege.

[Speaker 5]
So I do have a bunch of undead that, you know, was helpfully kept in a holding thing, so like, it's not too many though, but yeah, could help.

[Speaker 2]
I think Cara- I'm gonna have Cara's leave, like, while you guys are going back to the place. If he will allow that, I'm gonna have Cara's leave, because I really want her to get back to the gate. Kidi, however, is going to stay.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, what's up with the gate, by the way?

[Speaker 2]
Is that just a- It is activated. It's like a portal network that uses like the Feywild, the woad. Oh, is it the fast travel one?

Yes, it's a fast travel one.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that is fascinating.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so I've been trying to get that in order for a little bit, so I really want Cara's there. Okay, so I'm going to go back to the gate, and I'm going to Okay, are you trying to close it, or just manage it? Manage it.

I think it's just been activated, so...

[Speaker 5]
Okay, best of luck then.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. All right, we'll ask the wizard if he has any spells that he can help with the drow, because they're going to be coming in quite a bit.

[Speaker 5]
Hopefully we reinforce it, we can get a long rest.

[Speaker 4]
Does the wizard's tower have like a portcullis? Does it like- What's- Is it just like a door into like a single structure? There's no palisades or anything?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know. Check the book.

[Speaker 7]
Like worst comes to worst, like in between downtime. We're still stuck here. I can- Wall of stone to erupt defenses.

Give this place actual walls for a while.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it is fortified.

[Speaker 7]
I mean, does it have walls?

[Speaker 3]
Like- Reading blah blah blah. A tower has plus one- Yeah, it has a fortification bonus. I assume it counts for something.

And furthermore, blah blah blah, does it say anything about- Yeah, no. Yeah, it doesn't have walls necessarily, but it is reinforced.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we just quickly dig a moat.

[Speaker 7]
I can do that. Like, use trans- Yeah, in between like using downtime, use transmute rock to- Yeah. And stone ship to make, you know, little like moat sections.

Use wall of stone to give this actual walls.

[Speaker 3]
Let's contact a wizard for this one. To see if he can contribute.

[Speaker 5]
Do you have- Wait, do you have wall of stone?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. I don't have it prepared right now, but- Ah, okay.

[Speaker 5]
If you did, because if you concentrated for the full 10 minutes, you know.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it's permanent. That's why I suggested this.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Murpus is gonna help here. He's gonna move furniture and shit to like block windows and, you know, the like.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, like just throwing cantrips when they get close should carry us pretty far. Like, cantrips out a window. Boom, boom.

When they come close, we can drop a level spell if necessary. Boom, boom, cantrips.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, like when, you know, when morning comes and we get the dead bodies, we can collect them, put them in a pit, slowly use animate dead and just- Oh, yeah. Skeletons or zombies in there.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, very nice idea. And we can make them fight their own.

[Speaker 4]
Can anyone do like earth shaping? I know we have stone shape.

[Speaker 5]
I have stone shape.

[Speaker 4]
I have stone shape prepared right now. Sweet. Because what's also useful are ram parts.

So like kind of you like landscape around the structure to create sort of like a natural stair step. So they don't just have like a flat thing. They have to like climb up these sort of embankments.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
So I've just been counted. Oh, in the Raptor.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, and I can use that to make the surrounding area difficult terrain.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, okay.

[Speaker 7]
And that, according to the spell, each five foot square portion requires at least one minute to clear by hand. That's a 20 feet. Nice.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. Okay, let's see. So I would have 12 skeletons and zombies to dump on people, but probably a mix of all.

So maybe let me make a list of the things that we're doing. So using stone shape and transmute rock to make walls and moats of sorts. And I animated that.

Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I always have animate that prepared because Spore Druid.

[Speaker 5]
You also have animate that? That's awesome.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, because Spore Druid. I always have it prepared.

[Speaker 5]
Neat. So how many can you make? Because I just hold a bunch of them for when needed.

[Speaker 7]
Do you just have a whole bunch of corpses?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 7]
Well, I've not used my fifth level spell slot. I have not. And because we rested quite a while ago, I recovered my fourth level spell slot.

And I have two third level. That's a lot of skeletons we can make.

[Speaker 3]
How do people make oil? I have fabricate. Oh, you know, the classical defensive tradition, blah, blah, blah.

Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 7]
With that you can also make walls as well.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I can. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So fortifying the tower.

[Speaker 5]
You guys are making zombies. So to make a list of the things that we have so far, stone shape, transmute rock, and fabricate to help with wall making and moats of sorts, animated dead for convenient soldiers and guards, including the ones had already. And that's what we have so far.

[Speaker 6]
Improvised barricades with furniture and the like.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. And improvised barricades.

[Speaker 1]
Are you guys intending to stay at the... you guys are intending to stay at this place? Yes.

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Karis is leaving though. I would like Karis to fly back towards the... how does that work?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you picked a good time to do it. As the dragon is currently mustering forces for the sake of an assault on the tower.

[Speaker 2]
The tower only teleports when the wizard's dead, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's not the only time it teleports, but that's the time that the wizard knows of. Every time the wizard dies, the tower teleports.

[Speaker 2]
And he just comes back?

[Speaker 1]
At some point, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What if we kill him and then res him?

[Speaker 7]
I do have a fire prepared.

[Speaker 5]
Does the thing go with us in it if it teleports?

[Speaker 2]
No, it doesn't actually. No, scratch that. It doesn't.

[Speaker 5]
What doesn't?

[Speaker 2]
The tower. The tower wouldn't take us with it because we had to get out of it really quickly because...

[Speaker 1]
Well, you guys had to get out of it really quickly so that you didn't temporarily lose access to it. I don't think any of you stayed in there.

[Speaker 2]
Would it have taken us with it?

[Speaker 1]
Nobody tested it. Everybody got out. Right.

[Speaker 2]
And it would suck if... Well. Yeah.

So everybody that lives there is bound to it. So, like, the prostitutes are bound to it. The wizard's bound to it.

The only one that isn't bound to it is the guy that we have tied up.

[Speaker 7]
Perf wizard.

[Speaker 1]
Long may he reign.

[Speaker 5]
What would the wizard be doing to help reinforce this as well?

[Speaker 1]
That's... I'm only... I already know what he's going to do, which is cast sparrows.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
The question is what you guys are going to do and who is going to take casualties if and when that happens.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean? Like, who's gonna die? Is that what you're asking?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Well, no, that's not what I'm asking.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I'm saying.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. Maybe we should all just leave. Yeah, great idea.

We pat the mortal wizard on the back and be like, great talk.

[Speaker 9]
We're not.

[Speaker 3]
We don't want to try to defend it from the dragon. I mean, I would. It is coming to us now.

[Speaker 1]
You guys have an idea of which forces are on their way, right? You got three dozen wyverns. They've got two riders a piece.

A dozen. Then you have, let's see here. You're aware of the darkling forces and how many people there are, right?

So there's about two dozen wyverns there and about one rider a piece.

[Speaker 3]
I would like to ask the owner of the tower if he's here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, now you've ordered Thalzar if you're back.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if he thinks we have a shot, if we stay.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm going to live either way, so I'm happy about it. I'm mostly just concerned. My biggest concern is just not getting trapped again, because of course that's the only thing that really causes me any consternation, is the idea of losing my autonomy, or I might otherwise have it.

[Speaker 2]
So he doesn't know if we would teleport with him, would he?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, if you would teleport with me? That's a good question.

[Speaker 3]
Can I cast Augury?

[Speaker 9]
So that's a no.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, can... like three of you spoke at once.

[Speaker 2]
What are you trying to cast?

[Speaker 3]
Augury.

[Speaker 9]
Oh hey, that's a good one.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, blah blah blah. By casting blah blah blah, you know this. And the plan, I'm going to...

Oh wait, it's the next 30 minutes. Fuck. Okay, so when we...

when the time comes, I could cast it.

[Speaker 2]
What does it do?

[Speaker 3]
I can get four results, depending on if the plan or course of action we are about to take within the next 30 minutes is good, bad, good and bad, or nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so let's say we kill the wizard and revive him.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
That's the question. Will we go with them? If not, then we will be stuck in the dirt.

[Speaker 3]
And that's going to be a very bad possibility. Yeah, we could do that.

[Speaker 1]
But what's the course of action that you're asking about, I guess?

[Speaker 3]
Killing the wizard.

[Speaker 1]
Killing the wizard, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Killing the wizard, making sure that we will revive him.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah. Killing the wizard, reviving him. He revives anyway.

[Speaker 1]
What's the revive thing here? You guys, he's already been killed once. You are aware that he has told you explicitly that he comes back to life at some point.

[Speaker 2]
How does he feel about dying again to save literally everyone and the tower itself?

[Speaker 7]
And also to preserve his autonomy.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, like the dragon's coming. Wait, we can ask him that personally, but we can ask how the teleporting would go. So, asking the wizard personally.

[Speaker 2]
He doesn't know if we'd go with him, so we just need to ask him if he's okay with being killed.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not sure I quite like my current position. And standing and fighting means that I can... You know, if I stand and fight, then maybe I die anyways, and then I get teleported somewhere.

[Speaker 2]
But everyone dies.

[Speaker 1]
Not necessarily.

[Speaker 7]
Wasn't there the risk that- We can just leave.

[Speaker 1]
Due to you, what that dragon did to the perv wizard? Not quite. So, what the perv wizard did...

Oh, I guess technically there is something of a risk. Huh. No, because I would take out the perv wizard.

I suppose my primary objective then would be dealing with this wizard. And with the dragon, it's the issue of having men to hold a field. So that's where the drawn come in.

But I do have contingencies. I've spent the last few hours getting them ready. Basically, I'll blow up the tower and myself.

[Speaker 5]
Would you die for our sake? So we can't just leave. We can just go.

He's good.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, what if we go the way- Oh, good.

[Speaker 1]
I was hoping that you would stick around. I was actually hoping that you would deal with the dragon. What happened?

[Speaker 2]
Well, the dragon is pretty... He's got lots of reinforcements. That's why I'm saying it would be best for literally everyone if we just teleported the tower away.

[Speaker 5]
And gathered reinforcements ourselves and whatnot.

[Speaker 7]
To explain, the dragon has a spire. They're at the top. And we can't get to it without flight.

And only two of us have actual meaningful access to flight.

[Speaker 2]
And he's got a bunch of drow.

[Speaker 1]
I see.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And darklings. And wyverns.

[Speaker 1]
And wyverns. And like- Did the darklings secure their alliance with the wyvern?

[Speaker 2]
Probably.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, certainly a few of them. At this point, I don't- The risk is that I teleport, you know, and I teleport the tower.

And I won't remember my fondness for you. Or I might not remember my fondness for you the next time I appear. If you don't come along, then obviously you'll be left here without any shelter.

[Speaker 2]
We're not going to tell him this. But we do have the spell that tells us if- This is out of character.

[Speaker 3]
We'll probably mess with the outcome if we tell him.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we don't want to mess with the outcome.

[Speaker 1]
So- Is there a way we can cast that spell at some point, by the way?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, without- After we confirm that we can kill this guy. Because Kibi is going to just fucking send it. If after this spell is- After we've confirmed it, that's the plan.

[Speaker 3]
So the course of action. Is killing the wizard, and- No, I don't need to know.

[Speaker 1]
I just need to know when you cast it.

[Speaker 3]
30 minutes before- Like, we decide to kill the wizard.

[Speaker 1]
When you cast it, let me know. I'm not interested in any of the details about it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Does the wizard- You guys have been waffling on every single decision you've made today.

[Speaker 2]
Has the wizard given us permission to kill him?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Well, here's the thing. If you- If you- Shouldn't we- But Trite managed it before. The question is whether or not- If the tower teleports, and you don't come with me, then you are left here, alone.

With no shelter.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Almost the same as if you had just started walking in the other direction.

[Speaker 2]
You know what? Yeah, let's just leave the tower and start walking away from the tower. Away from the spire.

And just go that way.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 7]
Rowan's just gonna start talking to the wizard. So, the memory issues. So, every time you die, you forget things?

[Speaker 1]
Sort of. It's not really a major bout of forgetfulness. It's more, I don't- My relationships with other people are not consistent.

So, any new relationships I've made with people since my last death, my last teleport, are not going to be- Will not be maintained. In my mind. I might know of you.

I might still recognize you. But the question will be, how I treat you. At the end of the day.

[Speaker 7]
That makes sense. Have you considered the possibility of setting up, say, glyphs of warding with modified memory that would contain your experiences?

[Speaker 1]
That's- To help get you back up to speed. My boy. My dear, my dear, dear boy.

All easy paths to knowledge have been tried and trued already, and sorry. Yeah, I know. I was just trying to- This is a little bit more- No, it's a good thought.

It's just, this is a little bit more advanced than more simple solutions have.

[Speaker 7]
So you need some sort of self-updating system, then.

[Speaker 5]
Would love to ask about the mortality, but we do have to make a decision about are we staying, are we going?

[Speaker 2]
That is the- If we stay, we are more likely to die. If we leave, we are less likely to die. Then, are we going to go?

[Speaker 6]
Emotionally. Of course, if we stay, there's a chance we die. Let's ask the wizard, the smartest man in the room.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, you know what? You can argue if we will die if we stay. How about that?

[Speaker 4]
We can argue about staying and whether that would be good, bad, mixed, or none. Okay, so are we currently trying to decide between staying at the keep or abandoning it and retreating? That is the decision we are currently- Okay, what- If we abandon the keep entirely and just, like, get out of here, what do we lose?

Lose the keep?

[Speaker 2]
We lose the keep, we don't kill the dragon. Okay- Mission failed, but we get out with our lives.

[Speaker 4]
Do we want to keep the keep? I think there's a lot of benefit to keeping the keep.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think we really can keep it.

[Speaker 4]
Heart says don't care if you keep it or not. Rez, did you say you want to keep it? Yes, I see great benefit in keeping the keep.

Cool, okay. Does anyone else care, one way or the other, about whether we keep the keep?

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's not ours to keep, to begin with. I would prefer if we kept it.

[Speaker 5]
If someone's- Okay, look, the worst thing that's going to happen is losing the- whatever connection, friendship, is with the wizard if he doesn't manage to succeed with defeating everyone, right? But the thing is, he will come back, we will not.

[Speaker 4]
Right, so there's risks to staying. I'm just wondering, are there costs to leaving?

[Speaker 5]
And it seems like the cost is- Besides him maybe dying and his friendship, and I guess- What he's asking is, are there costs to the party for- are there any obvious costs to the party for leaving?

[Speaker 4]
Is the way- For Rez, we're going to lose access to the keep, and that'll be bad. Does anyone else care about that?

[Speaker 3]
No. I care. I was planning on asking the wizard, assuming things didn't go to hell, to take Evelyn as his ward.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we have two people who want to keep the keep. Sounds like most other people are indifferent.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to leave.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, keeping the keep, what's that going to require? So we could do the teleporting to keep out, and maybe dealing with this guy's memory loss or whatever, like re-establishing the connection. That's option one.

Option two is we stay in the keep and we actually do the fight, right? We've got maybe additional magic users here who can help us blast stuff out of the sky. I don't know.

Do either of those two- For Fallen and for Rez, how do you feel about those two options?

[Speaker 3]
I'm fine with trying, to be honest. I'm fine with trying too. My invention of not being able to- Fighting, you're saying?

[Speaker 4]
Like, taking the fight here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, assuming the wizard is helping us out. Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
How does everyone else feel about staying and fighting?

[Speaker 2]
I do not want to, in the slightest.

[Speaker 8]
I think it's good.

[Speaker 1]
Karis is going to be going back to the gate, basically regardless, because she has something of such importance to Rez.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I also just don't want Kibi to die, and I feel like this is going to end in a casualty, because there's hundreds of enemies coming at us. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
And that's completely fine. And Rowan also needs to get back to the gate as well.

[Speaker 6]
That's a completely fair sentiment. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Rez?

[Speaker 6]
But Fallen, I'm with you.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Wait. So in light of the consideration of maybe the overwhelming nature of the people that are coming, we've had like a couple dozen wyvern riders, and I'm not sure how many troops on foot. A lot.

A lot, right. So- I'm sorry, what are the troops on foot?

[Speaker 2]
The drow? And the darklings?

[Speaker 1]
No, neither of them are on foot.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, they're on wyverns? Of course.

[Speaker 1]
They're on wyverns. The cloggeths are on foot. There are currently about 80 remaining.

[Speaker 6]
That simplifies things.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we need air control. I'm sconding. I have a meeting that I would like to not fight them face to face.

[Speaker 6]
So Fallen, do you have any ways of dealing with flying wyverns?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, how large are wyverns? Big. Large?

[Speaker 4]
Big enough to carry two?

[Speaker 3]
I can force four of them to make con saves, or be incapacitated and have their speed drop to zero.

[Speaker 4]
Which means they fall.

[Speaker 6]
I- I have herbalist dice to help with that too. No. You can- what?

Yeah, I can change con resets.

[Speaker 1]
You can change con saves within 10 feet of you. Oh, within 10 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, you know, you are free to jump out of that. But also, and I'm going to ask the wizard for his highest level spell scrolls. Like, let's go all out here.

[Speaker 1]
No, I want those.

[Speaker 3]
Like to defend. Okay, not his highest level, but anything which might be useful, you know.

[Speaker 1]
Anything that- I can give you some things that might be useful.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and because I have scholar dice, I can increase my roll on scrolls and stuff. Um, also, also, how much time do we have in days?

[Speaker 1]
Zero.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, zero. The only question at this point is whether- is what targets the dragon and the dragon's forces are going to be attacking, and if they split. Which, at the moment, only I know.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no, I'm fine with going out with a bang.

[Speaker 2]
I'm with you. Like being alive. It's going to be three of you.

It's going to be three people fighting.

[Speaker 7]
Quite frankly, Rowan wants to see the stars.

[Speaker 5]
He is going to be going with Garry's. Yeah, I'm also leaving. I have- if- I can't fight the darklings if I want to talk with them, so.

[Speaker 2]
I think if you guys value your lives, you will leave with us.

[Speaker 4]
How many wyvern riders- not riders, just wyverns.

[Speaker 1]
I think if you said there were two dozen that had two, and- There are three dozen Garrowyverns, which are the drow- the ones that the drow are riding. And then there are two dozen of the darklings- two dozen of the darklings wyverns, which are litter wyverns. They're- they look like large fairy dragons, basically.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so that's 60 altogether.

[Speaker 2]
So Kibi's going to be getting stuff ready to leave. You guys can follow her if you want to.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm going with- I wish the others good luck and say, alas, I cannot stay. And also start leaving with Cerys and stuff.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, when it gets time to leave with Cerys and Kibi, Rowan will be activating Pass Without Trace for them.

[Speaker 3]
Who is not leaving? I'm not leaving.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and list who is or is not leaving, and blue dragon to white rook.

[Speaker 3]
Res, what are you playing?

[Speaker 6]
I'm playing a monk barb. Well, maybe a monk.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, do you want a ring of spell storing with Sleetstorm in it?

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Then we can have two of them up. Yeah, that requires you not to venture into, like, the heart of the fight, though. Since it's concentration.

[Speaker 6]
I can do that for the start of it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I think we're being abandoned here, though.

[Speaker 3]
What did you say?

[Speaker 6]
Honest opinion. I think we're kind of being left, uh...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Left to the, uh... What's the saying?

[Speaker 3]
Elements?

[Speaker 4]
How many wizards are at the tower? And what levels are there?

[Speaker 3]
Level eight here? Or level seven wizard, technically? No, no, no, the NPCs.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. The perv wizard, technically speaking, is hostile. But, I don't know, maybe he'll get...

I think, actually, probably getting... Dominating him would be one of the wizard's first go-to options.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So as long as that list, I guess you have two there. Yeah. Let's see here.

Perv wizard is level eight. Or, I think, actually, technically level seven, but... Level eight, but seventh of a wizard.

Then you have the perv wizard, who is a mix of, like, dual-classed, I guess. Artificer and... Artificer wizard.

At twelve.

[Speaker 6]
There is very much a chance we can win this, guys.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just saying.

[Speaker 1]
People will make their decisions as far as that goes.

[Speaker 3]
It would be a severe breach of character to leave now. For this specific eccentric.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, can you say that again?

[Speaker 3]
It would be a breach of character, like, for my character to leave right now. For this specific eccentric.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't... I don't... I didn't understand what the last word was, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Evelyn can't possibly leave now. It's completely against character.

[Speaker 4]
You said for this specific something?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, for this, like, specific eccentric, i.e. this specific character, i.e. Evelyn. Specific eccentric? What is eccentric?

[Speaker 5]
You know, eccentric is saying that this character can't leave because of their personality or being strange and stuff.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, this particular eccentric. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay, so you were using it as a noun. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, there's a portal in the fridge?

[Speaker 9]
What?

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it goes to a... It goes to a nice box. Actually, there's a...

There is a hallway behind the fridge, and then there is a second fridge in which the... In which a portal to some of the Fey Realms exists.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. Huh. So that could be a fallback plan for you guys.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, hey, come on.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Into the frost fridge.

[Speaker 7]
It is unfortunate. Oh, go ahead. It is unfortunate that I cannot take people with me with tree stride.

[Speaker 3]
What were you saying, James?

[Speaker 1]
I was... I had a thought about using the woad to bypass time jail or one-to-one time, which you can do if you go to the woad, then you end the session in... If you go to the woad, then you end the session in...

Or sorry, your next session with those characters will pick up exactly where they left off. But that doesn't stop events in the real world from progressing, just stops it from affecting your characters specifically. But of course, that means...

That includes the tower, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I see the battle. How will we be playing it out?

Will we be doing actual combat, like simplified roles?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, a mix of in between. I have the hero... I have most of the hero roles for the mass combat setup.

And basically simplified methods of what it is when you... When you guys... What the exchange rate of weapon attacks...

Or I guess not even weapon attacks, but regular attacks versus... Spells versus men-at-arms are. I do have a rough idea of how that goes.

It's not... I'm not even a rough idea. I have...

I know how it goes on the warfare scale. So that will be... That will be how we approach it.

It's just you guys don't have any troops of your own. It's just unfortunate.

[Speaker 3]
One man-at-army? Or like three man-at-army?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's... I mean, probably there was a reconnaissance zone.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So Fallen, what's the plan once it goes down?

[Speaker 3]
I have some general idea. Like hypnotic pattern to try to just charm the wyverns. And then they are fall prone.

So then end concentration. So they fall down. Sleet storm when not doing that.

Things that come too close. I can force to make a con save or fall prone. But the general plan is just...

Pit it till it dies while hiding behind walls, I think. Unless the wizard has some miracle spell.

[Speaker 1]
The one advantage I have... It says Thalazar. The one advantage I do have is the fact that they have to approach the tower.

It's in a relatively... You know, this is a relatively open area. So long as there's no real opportunity for something to come from behind without my being aware of it.

[Speaker 9]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Which means as they approach, I would be able to project some spells out and deal with... Do they know dwells out here? Nope.

So we'll have to... And same for you. You'll have the opportunity to kill some people before they actually get here.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Do you have a bow in here by chance? Something I could use.

[Speaker 1]
A bow? No. I just assumed that you were going to walk out there and start...

Start smacking people who found it most opportune.

[Speaker 6]
I was planning on, you know, doing some poke first, you know. Just poking them away.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Unfortunately, I mean, I have a basic bow. It's around here somewhere.

[Speaker 6]
My corpus is going to run off and start searching.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you'd be able to use it.

[Speaker 2]
Are we doing anything else this session other than leaving the tower?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, nope. Just people are making their final decisions. I do need to ask...

I do need to ask Dallas and Nessie whether or not their characters are sticking here.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, Nessie said that Monk is going to go through the portal behind the fridge with Piteous. Piteous. I don't know how to say his name.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let's see here. Oh, and are they doing that now or is that like a backup plan?

[Speaker 2]
Um, that's all she said. So if you want to ask her.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'll clarify. I'll clarify with her to see whether or not that's a backup plan.

[Speaker 3]
Does the wizard have like a stronghold as described in the book?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, then he can change use control weather. To make it a torrential rain driving hail or a blizzard. And change it to Arctic cold or something.

Which would probably make it a hell for any invading force. Especially if they rely on flying.

[Speaker 1]
There's a little bit of difficulty with that given that you have the the competing lair effects of the dragon. Which a previous, you weren't here for this last session, but previously what happened was the, um, this entire X effectively was shrouded in, not the entire X, but the entire whole. Which is still the majority of it was shrouded in a hurricane.

[Speaker 3]
And the dragons were flying in a hurricane?

[Speaker 1]
Was the dragon flying in a hurricane? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's his hurricane.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, what if we amp it though? Like amp the hurricane with control weather. Yeah, and make it like, because hurricane is already, you know, really strong.

I don't know how to properly.

[Speaker 1]
No, so I see where you're coming from. It's just that this creature magically produces the hurricane itself. And I really don't think that the intensifying the dragon's magical power.

[Speaker 3]
All right, fair enough.

[Speaker 1]
Is going to benefit us. Not against the dragon themselves.

[Speaker 2]
But the reinforcements. Yeah. Like the other little glitter dragons, glitter wyverns and drow and darklings will be severely limited.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, an amped blue dragon storm seems pretty tough to handle unless they have some are also shielded by it.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi has no way to, even if Kibi did stay, she'd have no way to like attack from the tower because she's all melee.

[Speaker 1]
If we have more time, you would be able to. If we have more time, you would be able to. We'd be able to try to figure that out.

[Speaker 2]
All right, you guys, I have stuff to do. I'm going to head out.

[Speaker 8]
No worries.

[Speaker 3]
Have a good one. Bye. See you later.

Bye. See ya.

[Speaker 1]
All right. We got Nessie, Corpus, Evelyn, soon-to-be-dominated and the tower's true owner sticking behind. And then those of you who are leaving, go ahead and make the go ahead and do your exploration rolls.

This is the last thing I'd like you to take care of. Besides that, we will consider the session closed.

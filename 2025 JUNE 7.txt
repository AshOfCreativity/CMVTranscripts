[Speaker 1]
Uh, Faros. Sir Faros.

[Speaker 2]
Can you type that in the chat? Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Are you joining, James, or are you listening?

[Speaker 4]
I am joining.

[Speaker 2]
Yay!

[Speaker 4]
Yay!

[Speaker 2]
McCannon has the information we'll need. Um, what is, what is mechanic, McCannon?

[Speaker 3]
McCannon. Investigator. Investigator, okay, good job.

Then, I'm gonna get rid of Monk, so, uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He would just disappear.

[Speaker 5]
It's okay, he hasn't really been interacting much.

[Speaker 3]
No, and that's what Monk does. Monk just, Monk comes and goes as he pleases.

[Speaker 4]
Monk doesn't stay.

[Speaker 2]
We've been given a similar quest as yesterday's, but now, as we're leaving the tavern, somebody by the name of Fred has, um, beckoned us into a dark alley and is telling us that we might be walking into an ambush. I mean, he didn't beckon us, we chased him. We did, we did.

[Speaker 3]
Like an angry goose. Those were walking into a trap. Do you have any proof?

[Speaker 1]
Proof?

[Speaker 3]
That we're walking into a trap.

[Speaker 1]
I was meant to report my, uh, my friend was a well-seasoned traveler. There's no way he would have fallen to local brogands.

[Speaker 5]
But that's not proof. That is just, uh, what you're saying.

[Speaker 2]
What would Mr. Farrow say if I mentioned Fred Wright to him?

[Speaker 1]
I'm sure he wouldn't say anything. I doubt he even knew who I am, unless he purchased some of our ships. All right, let's try that.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
What did you say happened to your friends?

[Speaker 1]
He was sent out on a quest, just like youse, and he never returned.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, we could keep a lookout for your friend, or... The remains of your friend.

[Speaker 2]
Does this guy look human? Yes. Okay, and I don't, I don't suspect...

[Speaker 1]
Do you see the picture?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes. I just wanted to make sure that he was indeed human, and not just masquerading as one.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I believe you can do a perception check.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, can I sense motive on him?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, give us a blind checks, please.

[Speaker 2]
Perception... Oh boy, Susudio, bless your heart. Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Perry, you get the sense that he is telling the truth? Like, his intentions are true? He does believe that something has, something nefarious has happened to his friend?

[Speaker 4]
I feel two hit points since yesterday.

[Speaker 1]
Susudio, you think he is a human? He could be an elf. You're not too sure.

He could also be a very tall halfling.

[Speaker 3]
You said a really tall halfling?

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Yeah, like, Perry is a really short dragonborn? Or, I suppose, lizardfolk?

In this world?

[Speaker 3]
I believe him. Let's go on the quest and just kill who's gonna kill us.

[Speaker 7]
And save who we can save.

[Speaker 2]
I guess we can't. I guess he doesn't know much information, considering his friend just didn't come back. It's not like...

You didn't find a body, did you?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 2]
That's unfortunate.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think anyone who's gone on these quests has found a body of anyone who's gone there.

[Speaker 2]
My friend said that there was some kind of necromancy? Isn't that what it was? That's how Susudio is going to interpret it.

There was necromancy.

[Speaker 1]
He has a very sour look on his face when you say that.

[Speaker 2]
Understandable.

[Speaker 1]
He's like, if you don't mind, I can join you. You know, I feel more than comfortable in the woods by myself, but I don't think I could get the truth by myself.

[Speaker 5]
Well, we're here to help as best we can. I believe you, I think. Does anyone else have any objections?

[Speaker 1]
A little fancy bow as a gesture, like, when you say I believe you.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, Plank already said he was for this guy, so...

[Speaker 2]
As a player, I don't like this guy. As Susudio, sure. Why not?

Bring him along.

[Speaker 1]
Sully. And do you realize, as you're going out, you see there's someone who's trying to catch up with you. Looks like...

I'm not too sure if you've met him before, but McCannon is trying to join the party.

[Speaker 5]
He was very puffy, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Have you met him before?

[Speaker 5]
I think Kara's been on an adventure with him.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if Plank has met him before. Plank's gonna get into the angry goose attack position. Oh, I know him.

Oh, he's fine. Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1]
You just heard from the guy who's offering the employment that there's been recently some adventurers have taken up on their hand, and then if you quickly leave, you'd be able to catch up with them. You'd be immediately able to notice them by the flying ghost monster.

[Speaker 2]
Also, put your character in the party.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I have not put them in the party. I thought I had done that. Very silly of me.

[Speaker 1]
Great. And is everyone ready to proceed?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Any last shopping trips, items, potions?

[Speaker 2]
Monk doesn't... Not my monk. What the hell?

[Speaker 7]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I was reading the class and... Yeah, anyway. Sicilio doesn't really have enough money to buy many things.

Yeah, I don't know. I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
There's also mentioned... Just so mechanics are aware, there was mentioned before about the afflictions of holiness and unholiness on each other. Just as a mindful reminder, just in case if you do cast those things.

[Speaker 3]
How many spoons do I have? Hang on.

[Speaker 7]
Never enough.

[Speaker 3]
No, I mean, that's the correct answer, but I have a spoon gun. So like, it's... I've got 44.

I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
So Fredda advises that he might actually know the place where they're talking about. It's an extremely good ambush spot.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So you should be transferring there now. And as he guides you through, so you'll be able to see the area coming up. He normally advises that most people will pass through there because the mountain is quite difficult to navigate.

It'll be quite a bit hard, but we're sure he'll be able to climb up and get the advantage of anyone down in there. Or you can sneak up on top of the mountain if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
We could probably sneak up the mountain. What was the question again? The other option?

[Speaker 1]
So there'll be three party icons. So one down here, one down there, and one up there.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so this is like a vantage point, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So there's, as you see, there's like a valley. So there's sheer cliffs on this side.

There's a path face going up there that you can walk up. The cliffs here, I think that's about like 10 feet. That's about 15 feet.

Get to the lunch about five feet high. And there's like a ramp here that just goes up along the cliff face to the other side.

[Speaker 2]
All right, I think we should go to the one up here.

[Speaker 1]
All right. And you said that you have climbing equipment?

[Speaker 5]
Para has climbing equipment.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, with the climbing equipment, you're able to get up there no problems. So you won't need to worry about a check for that one. So yay!

And how are you trying to get up there? Are you trying to be sneaky? Just going normally?

[Speaker 2]
Probably go sneakily, if possible.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, no problems. And then can I get some stealth checks, please? Yas.

[Speaker 5]
Sneak or sneaks?

[Speaker 7]
Ah, stealth, sorry.

[Speaker 5]
Is that exploration? Is that downtime? No, we could not.

Regular stealth or avoid notice?

[Speaker 1]
Just a regular stealth.

[Speaker 7]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 1]
And then can also get a perception.

[Speaker 5]
From everyone? Uh, yeah. Secret or not?

[Speaker 1]
I'll go secret.

[Speaker 2]
I both love and hate the secret option.

[Speaker 4]
You have to start and lead.

[Speaker 3]
My favorite part is when someone has the mob, it's like you rolled so and so in a row. You roll something that triggers that.

[Speaker 1]
So, as you start a farm at the mountain, it's quite rugged. You're normally pretty stealthy. There is a little bit of flips and falls, which is normally pretty good.

If you want to place your tokens up here, you notice there is a person hiding over the cliff up here.

[Speaker 2]
Don't say anything, Frank.

[Speaker 5]
He's knocking.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you so much. You have a perfect day. Ooh, I heard, I heard a footfall.

Can I see it?

[Speaker 2]
It's a dampier. Let me take this. I can smell him.

All right. Um, can I sneak up behind him and smack him? Or is that not a Pathfinder thing?

There's a little dampier of the mood.

[Speaker 1]
First we named the rogue guy. Damn it. Yeah, if you want to go and attack him, we can roll initiative.

[Speaker 5]
Using stealth?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So much worse.

[Speaker 5]
Do you want all of us to roll stealth?

[Speaker 1]
If you want to roll stealth or you can roll perception, it's your choice.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, do you want all of us to roll initiative?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, initiative, yeah. Yeah, someone start initiative. Um, roll initiative.

No, I should probably roll it as stealth.

[Speaker 3]
So, Nani, good job. Yeah. Ayyy.

Damn, I am not stealthy.

[Speaker 5]
My curse was transferred to you.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, my stealth was a two, so it's untrained.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I know, but Para used to always roll below a ten.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god, I remember that.

[Speaker 5]
And like, that was after her modifier. I've broken it. And yet, it follows.

[Speaker 3]
Is my cannon gonna fight with us?

[Speaker 4]
Did my initiative go up?

[Speaker 3]
Where's your token?

[Speaker 4]
He put himself all the way over down here. Yeah, that's my bad.

[Speaker 3]
Like an asshole.

[Speaker 4]
Ew, I'm gonna start over this way. I'll get to you guys.

[Speaker 1]
He has his own thing to fight.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, where's the bad guy? Point to him with your nose. A little more.

Uh, I see him, I see him. Y'all get over there at some point.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna target that guy. I'm gonna do an action that nobody ever does. And recall knowledge.

[Speaker 3]
It's not true, I recall knowledge.

[Speaker 4]
We've been doing a lot of recall knowledge recently, it's been great.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I can never get my players to do it.

[Speaker 3]
We're getting, we're slowly getting trained. You've got two players to tell stories.

[Speaker 1]
Judging by the, uh, the, the equipment that he's wearing, he doesn't appear to be a ranger. Um, he looks to be more of a magical caster. Um, looks humanoid.

Doesn't look too monstrosity from the figure. Um, there's no special weaknesses or resistances that you can, you can think about at the moment.

[Speaker 5]
He's probably a caster. Actually, I'm gonna, oh, I can send two... I'm gonna send two messages to say that he is a caster.

To Susudio and to McCannon. And I'll just message and message. And then end turn.

[Speaker 1]
McCannon's turn.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, did somebody ask me?

[Speaker 1]
It's your turn.

[Speaker 4]
But we just got booed in here. A dude on the road. Oh, I can always hit him non-legally.

Yeah. Oh, sorry. I will, uh, just trying to right-click to, like, indicate his, his things.

Is this guy related to my device, anything? Or to my, to my goal?

[Speaker 1]
What is your goal?

[Speaker 3]
Why don't you ask him?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to... That's what I was asking him! I'm asking him, what is his goal?

[Speaker 3]
No, I was telling McCannon to ask him.

[Speaker 4]
For the, uh, that's funny, that's really handy. Is he related to my, my question of who's behind these, uh, caravan attacks? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
You've got a, a disturbing friend right behind you too, but...

[Speaker 4]
Could have beat him over the head. I think I got to beat him over the head. And, uh, so we can question him later, you know.

It's a sap. It's just like...

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, a critical hit.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I rolled a 20 for divisive strategy, so I was like, well... Oh, that kind of sucks.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, was that a normal damage or a crit? Oh, I didn't roll a crit.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my gosh. All right, that's... That's more like it.

I'm gonna mark him as off guard to Susubio. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Rope guy. He is absolutely freaking out, something's behind. He's like, they're over here!

And he's gonna come up here, and he's going to attempt to push you.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 7]
I'm gonna switch places here.

[Speaker 4]
Am I still audible with my regular audio? Yep.

[Speaker 5]
I...

[Speaker 4]
Disconnected.

[Speaker 7]
Reconnected.

[Speaker 4]
Immediately.

[Speaker 5]
Acknowledged.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, you're good.

[Speaker 5]
Can you hear us?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 8]
This one's on the scale.

[Speaker 1]
So a 22, I've laid a push. And, uh, you kind of take a little tumble down the hill.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. It's okay, it was really funny.

[Speaker 1]
And, uh, let's see...

[Speaker 3]
It's been so long since America's Funniest Home Videos.

[Speaker 1]
And... How much is... How much is 4 damage?

Sorry, just...

[Speaker 5]
26 for every 10 feet?

[Speaker 2]
All right, um, that will be 40 feet. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you can grab... If you'd like to do, you can use your reaction to grab an edge. Or arrest a fall.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh. Oh, wait. So it is a...

[Speaker 4]
It's probably just a check. You could still do your turn. I'm just gonna find the check.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, if you can do an athletics check. DC 15.

And then Susudio is your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. You managed to, uh, lessen your fall by grabbing the stuff. You take no fall damage.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. Now. Um, 2 damage.

Um, and that's my turn because I... Oh, okay. Well, I kill him and that will be my turn.

Hold on, do I have something? Um, all right. Yep, that's my, that's my go.

What the hell are you, buddy? You are a weird little bug. Hi.

Uh, oh, I need to click in turn. BRB!

[Speaker 1]
He took, seemed to take no damage from that.

[Speaker 2]
But he died.

[Speaker 1]
He died? Okay, never mind. He's been marked as death.

Yep. It says in the chat, a rogue guy takes no damage. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Did you do that after he died, though?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so. That would, that's what would have killed him if it did.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No problems. Um, soldier's turn.

He's gonna attack the cannon and he's going to try to claw him.

[Speaker 2]
BRB.

[Speaker 4]
Can they reach me? Uh. That's, that's something I don't know the answer to.

[Speaker 1]
So, if you critically succeed, you grab the edge of the handhold. And, and you stop falling. Um, success, you stop your fall.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I wouldn't, like.

[Speaker 1]
You still take the damage. Yeah, yeah, so there's, you got a success, not a critical success. So you'll take damage, but you treat the fall as 20 feet shorter.

Um, if you have no free hand to continue your falls if you fail the check. So, you still fall, but with the normal success, you treat it as 20 feet shorter, which means you take no damage. And he hits you for five.

And then he's gonna do a second attack. This is a map penalty. For another hit.

For an extra five.

[Speaker 4]
All right, go ahead and apply that damage to me.

[Speaker 1]
The second one is going to attempt to climb. You see McKenna, he starts to try to climb this cliff. Um, he makes no distance in that, as he can't manage to pull himself up.

And so he's going to move over here, and he'll try to do an attack.

[Speaker 2]
McKenna's getting jumped.

[Speaker 4]
I am. That's a completely accurate description of events.

[Speaker 1]
422. Physics damage.

[Speaker 4]
Can I apply that to me? Click send. It's a good thing I healed for that too.

All right, be on Garchus.

[Speaker 1]
So there's about a five foot gap between that plateau and the next.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
So you hop down that one.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay, and then... McKenna can get shielded with an amp.

So you get amped. You have...

[Speaker 1]
You notice the workaround is quite, um, quite loose.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I know. I just don't think Quake is strong enough to push it off. I don't think it might be.

I can try. I've already cast the shield though. So that's my turn.

I think we'll turn to Pera and Sicilio just plain at the rock.

[Speaker 2]
Just imagine him shaking his arm at it. Or his wing.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry. Pera's gonna move up here. Pera's gonna target the dying McKenna.

Who is not actually dying yet. Um, and she's going to blast to heal him.

[Speaker 4]
We're getting there, we're getting there.

[Speaker 5]
Hopefully he's living and not dead dead.

[Speaker 4]
No, no.

[Speaker 5]
Is anyone else within my range? Nope! So that two hit points just evaporates.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, looks like McKenna's back to full health too.

[Speaker 5]
I think it's funny that it has the prompt for rolling a fortitude save still.

[Speaker 4]
No, just in case. Yeah, just in case, yeah. Go ahead, but just in case.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, that is me, yes. Oh, hello. Are we trying to join with him?

Yes, you are. Okay. Oh, no.

Hey, don't fight me.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what's it going to do? It's going to click a target Pera and it's going to do a force barrage. Three bolts.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So you take 12 damage.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to do it the lazy way.

[Speaker 1]
As a guy comes out from the other side and he shoots these missiles, go pew pew pew pew! Flying, smacking the Pera. McKenna's dead.

[Speaker 4]
Woo! I should, uh, I'm going to attempt to climb up and, uh, scurry on back.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, can I get an acrobatics? Uh, sorry, athletics.

[Speaker 3]
You do have three shields with hardness five. Just so you know.

[Speaker 4]
I have three? Oh, what does that mean?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I amped the shield. So if you scroll up, um, we create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses. The duration increases to sustain up to one minute.

The shield still lowers at the start of each of your turns. Um, the shield has hardness five. So you've got effectively three shields.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
If you wanted to stay, you could.

[Speaker 4]
Kind of do. All right, well, I'm not going to use that at all. And, uh, skeleton instead.

Oh, hold on a second. That was incorrect. Much better.

Miss.

[Speaker 1]
So you're talking to a different one than you should buy a strategy mod?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Uh, anything else? No, nothing else.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing, it's the studio.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, um. Uh, I don't see anything about climbing in my thing. Um, but it does in like the ancestry thing, say that I have excellent grip when climbing.

Can I just? Okay, awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Can I just climb down this thing? Um, yeah. I'm just gonna drop.

I'm gonna drop my staff and do that. Um, drop.

[Speaker 1]
If you have two hands free, I reckon you could jump down here and then like grab at the end and just drop down if you want to land next to nearby. So if you want to go there.

[Speaker 2]
I can attack this guy. So that would have been, would that have been two actions or one? Dropping is three and then moving, jumping, whatever.

I don't know what that is.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'd say moving then dropping would be two.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, they pointed out the rock. Um, I'm gonna, I'm actually gonna not jump all the way down. I just have, so I move.

Yeah, I move here. That's actually just gonna be one action. Yep.

And I'm gonna push this if possible.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, give us a, uh, athletics check or a strength. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, strength.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Strength or athletics? Which one?

[Speaker 7]
Uh, athletics.

[Speaker 2]
Push it at this guy. Damn.

[Speaker 5]
You still knocked it prone.

[Speaker 1]
As you pushed across, you know, so the rock falls down guys. And slightly crushes the creature.

[Speaker 2]
I wonder if demoralizing work. Um, are they within 30 feet? Yeah, they're within 30 feet.

Um, actually do it to this one. The crow, should we do that one? I don't know, I don't even know if a skeleton can be demoralized, but I'm gonna try anyway.

[Speaker 5]
Mindless.

[Speaker 1]
Which one are you trying to demoralize?

[Speaker 5]
This one.

[Speaker 3]
Otter did say mindless. They are skeletons. They got no brain.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, can you please roll the check for it?

[Speaker 2]
Well, if they're mindless, I don't think they could be. You could do a recall knowledge check to see if you remember that they're mindless.

[Speaker 4]
The other thing is if you, like, roll for it anyways, because it'll, it'll tell us, hey.

[Speaker 1]
It'll tell you, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Or something like that. Yeah. If it's hiding somewhere.

[Speaker 2]
How do I move?

[Speaker 4]
It's an intimidation check.

[Speaker 2]
An intimidation check.

[Speaker 4]
Basic action macro has it on the first column.

[Speaker 2]
Demoralize. Demoralize. Boo.

Immune to mental. Okay. Got it.

All right, that's it. Thanks for hitting that one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess the skeleton's going to attack. Good. Claw.

Hit. Coulda coulda miss. And...

Miss. This one, this one is going to stand up. And...

He's going to try climb. 19. Yeah, as he manages to climb up here.

Klingster.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Oh, I don't like that. I need to sustain the shield spell.

[Speaker 1]
I believe that he lost one turn.

[Speaker 4]
You can sustain it because of that little thing from... earlier. Whatever that is.

[Speaker 3]
From amping it? Oh yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Tangible dream.

[Speaker 3]
The duration increases to sustain up to one minute. So it should last up to one minute.

[Speaker 5]
You do have to... Sustain means you have to spend an action to do that.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. It's not like I'm... I sustain it.

You have the shield still. I guess I'll cast it. Oh wait, no.

Are they immune? Is it immune in amping?

[Speaker 5]
What do you mean immune in amping?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so the regular shield says the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Is it amped? Is it the same?

[Speaker 1]
The only thing is that if you break it, you can't cast it for 10 minutes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Okay, so you can keep...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can still sustain it. But otherwise, if you want, you can keep casting it. Once it breaks, you can't recast for another 10 minutes.

[Speaker 3]
James, do you still have the shield effect on?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I do still have it. It says sustained.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, cool.

[Speaker 5]
Also, is it you can't cast the shield again? Or is it the person is immune to the shield spell? Because Klink can cast it on other people.

[Speaker 3]
After you shield block the spell ends, you can't cast it again for 10 minutes normally. Which is why I was asking if it counts if it's amped.

[Speaker 4]
I think that means you just can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, interesting. But that's only because it's the block.

[Speaker 4]
You can do more stuff with it, but you just can't cast it again for 10 minutes.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, buddy.

[Speaker 7]
Their skeleton body is slashing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the slashing weapons don't really seem to do much effect against his skeleton body.

[Speaker 3]
The slashing doesn't do anything against the skeleton body?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it doesn't appear to have much effect.

[Speaker 3]
Lent does though. Oh, okay. And I got them confused.

It's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Let's get the Paras turn.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. Um...

[Speaker 6]
Why is...

[Speaker 5]
Hmm. Uh, that guy far away, he's gonna get bone shook. Yep.

Uh, I'm just gonna do the two action version.

[Speaker 1]
It is a fail.

[Speaker 5]
All right, and then I am gonna cast shield upon myself. That's all.

[Speaker 1]
Rope guy, he is not happy. And he's going to cast another spell at peril. It's gonna do three actions.

So that's six damage.

[Speaker 4]
Is rope guy still alive? I thought he was dead.

[Speaker 5]
There's another one.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
Rope guy number two.

[Speaker 4]
Devise a strategy. I said...

[Speaker 2]
19, nice.

[Speaker 4]
I smack the skeleton.

[Speaker 7]
How does it hit?

[Speaker 4]
Um... I'll designate him as off guard to...

[Speaker 1]
You designate him off guard to who, sorry? Link. Who's decided.

[Speaker 4]
Very difficult decision.

[Speaker 1]
Um... You are doing non-lethal attacks too. You do have that option selected.

[Speaker 5]
I think the weapon that he's using is non-lethal.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And anything else? Well I moved, I am... I believe I'm too...

Am I close enough to intimidate this guy? I'd like to. I'd really love to.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I believe you're outside 30 feet. 50 feet.

[Speaker 4]
Oh I better get up.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what that was but... So this place here would be difficult terrain too.

[Speaker 4]
That's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Let's go. And that'd be... I believe that's your turn?

[Speaker 4]
That is my turn.

[Speaker 1]
It's the studio.

[Speaker 2]
The studio. All right we're gonna smack this guy.

[Speaker 7]
I have...

[Speaker 2]
Um and that's not... The second one isn't a map, right? Make two unarmed strikes.

[Speaker 1]
No you play your attacks as normal.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. As normal.

[Speaker 1]
So your second attack would be with map.

[Speaker 2]
Okay okay. Let's ignore that. Ignore this.

Ignore that. There we go. Um okay.

[Speaker 1]
So uh let's hit.

[Speaker 2]
That was two and then I could just hit. Or at least attempt to hit. Oh yeah oh what is this?

Wait. All right well. That's all me.

[Speaker 1]
The one he's going to... Chase after. A cannon.

So that's two actions as he dashes after. And then he's going to do an attack. Missing.

This one doesn't like to be attacked by... Punchy person. So he's going to do an attack back.

As he starts to do a frenzy back at you. As you do like a little fisticuffs. Klingsten.

[Speaker 3]
Assisting the shield.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
What? I'm sorry you hit that on the coffee table.

[Speaker 4]
Um. Make a mistake. Yeah.

Oh. The skellington right next to me is off guard to you by the way. Sorry what's the text?

Next to who? Oh it's you Kling.

[Speaker 3]
Ah okay cool. Good night. Oh I can see you.

Oh I have my beak. Oh I'll just peck him. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That is it?

[Speaker 3]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
You noticed as you tried to...

[Speaker 3]
Oh right next to you? Oh that's why I asked.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah it was.

[Speaker 3]
This guy... This guy's off... Okay then I wouldn't have done that.

I would have attacked him.

[Speaker 1]
Does he heal when you peck? No. It is a void.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not pecking him. I'm not pecking him. I meant to hit whoever was off guard to me and I just got the skeletons confused.

[Speaker 5]
Void healing wouldn't heal anytime you take void damage. That is only specifically the harm spell.

[Speaker 3]
I... oh that's mental. Fuck I'm running into the...

[Speaker 5]
They would just take nothing.

[Speaker 3]
Uh here's the thing though.

[Speaker 5]
Because otherwise vitality damage would heal everyone.

[Speaker 3]
65 feet. 65 feet away from me.

[Speaker 7]
Um.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Oh no I... well yeah it's at least something.

[Speaker 5]
65 feet away from you though.

[Speaker 3]
Did I say 65 feet? Is that what I said?

[Speaker 1]
They are 65 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh James! You gotta lead them closer!

[Speaker 8]
He ran to me, okay?

[Speaker 3]
Okay well I can't do anything. So yeah actually I just pecked this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay and then what are you doing with your other action? He knows that your pecking has no effect. So please still have one action left.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I'm gonna move away because this isn't... I'm gonna go down this little section. I'm gonna move away and just gently go down.

I can't. You took my turn away.

[Speaker 1]
Ah sorry. So you jumped down?

[Speaker 3]
Yep. Yeah I'm just... I'm just gonna...

I want to go my... I want to get away. I mean he can still hit me.

[Speaker 1]
No he wouldn't be able to hit you from there. That's like a 10 foot drop. So when you get...

once you get there like you're able to like lower yourself down. It's part of the action as well.

[Speaker 5]
And then Pyrrha's turn. That's a little solo. I can export.

Too many targets. Who else am I targeting? Oh this Asmode.

Get untargeted, bitch. Okay I am immune to myself. I take some healing.

And I have two more actions. I'll help out with this guy. I will needle darts them.

[Speaker 3]
I am getting the feeling that I'm gonna be completely useless in this fight. Besides keeping up shield.

[Speaker 5]
That is me.

[Speaker 1]
You know it's not as effective as you thought it would be.

[Speaker 5]
No it's exactly as effective as I thought it would be.

[Speaker 1]
This guy is going to come in to look at James and he's going to go... Leap! Flee!

[Speaker 3]
Oh wait. Oh um hang on. Uh...

I don't think he wants to.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry just quickly read that one. So it's basically counter-spell? Yeah.

Perfect. No problems. Okay so that was that one.

And I guess you're gonna cast a shield.

[Speaker 4]
But counter-insurance. No. Uh I'm definitely going to lose.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
From off-guard to...

[Speaker 7]
Wing. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
All right that's it.

[Speaker 3]
I mean I am with the needle darts rage but needle darts is not good.

[Speaker 2]
How many are alive right now?

[Speaker 1]
Three.

[Speaker 2]
Three okay.

[Speaker 1]
You have the two skeletons which look like they're about to fall apart. And you have this guy who's looking pretty banged up. How do you uh defeat this poor skeleton?

[Speaker 2]
Um this was full wave. Um. Oh god I'm really not great with describing deaths.

Just pretend uh he dies really really cool. It's a really cool death. It's very cool.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah with your technique you do like the one finger punch. You tap him on the forehead and he just crumbs through dust.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. It's a nice flick. Fire is out.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops that's two turns.

[Speaker 2]
This is a crit success. I deal double damage but I guess it doesn't doesn't really matter. Okay um so that's two turns.

And my last turn will be me. Oh wait is this a guy here? No he's dead.

[Speaker 7]
He's dead.

[Speaker 2]
Last turn will be me jumping down feet here. Yep perfect. Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
Okay so this is when he's going to try to protect his master. And he's just gonna go try whale on the uh the person attacking him.

[Speaker 7]
Yep five.

[Speaker 1]
Missing. Critical missing as he starts to flail on the cannon.

[Speaker 3]
He still has the shield so what are you taking that five damage?

[Speaker 1]
You can use your reaction to activate the shield. So Mechanida because it's yours um if you read in the spell section you can use your reaction to activate it and I believe there's three different layers to it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah and I think I already used my reaction to save him. Yes you did.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah and you only get one reaction.

[Speaker 3]
I guess we're taking that five damage sorry.

[Speaker 1]
But now it's your turn you have your action again.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I'll sustain it um and then for whatever it's worth I will cast needle dart since he's off guard to me.

[Speaker 1]
Uh you notice there's a big dart uh a big bouldering away.

[Speaker 3]
No I'm above the boulder. That's an incline it's it I'm at the top of this thing it's at an incline I can see him.

[Speaker 1]
No no he's dead okay um we're gonna roll damage and how do you kill him so you shoot your little needles then?

[Speaker 3]
I throw the needles in his joints and they just like pull apart and he crumbles.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect and last turn.

[Speaker 3]
No that's it yeah that's it that's why I argued about the boulder because I wanted my action.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah all righty um Pera's going to hop down um and then Pera's is it one movement or would it be two two to get down here?

[Speaker 1]
Uh so you'd consider the so the five across and then it'd be like a tenfold drop so it'd be like the 15 to move from up top to down bottom safely.

[Speaker 5]
Well I have um catfall and I am an expert in acrobatics so oh yeah I don't know if that changes anything.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah so you can just treat it as normal size if you're just moving across my train.

[Speaker 3]
Move like Yoda.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah let's go. Give you a little pounce.

[Speaker 5]
Uh okay that would be 30 so that would be two movement so I might as well move. All the way up. Do I want to move all the way up?

Yeah. And then with one action I'm gonna shield myself. Once again.

Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Probe guy uh seeing his minions are all out and he is terrified he is going to flee. Uh how how fast is everyone's movement speed?

[Speaker 3]
Don't count me in the chase. It's not gonna happen.

[Speaker 2]
25 I think? Yeah 25 for Susudio.

[Speaker 7]
It's 25.

[Speaker 1]
And I forgot to give Susidio the bonus experience.

[Speaker 3]
Susidio level one?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Do level twos get bonus experience?

[Speaker 5]
No. No because that's what it was for.

[Speaker 3]
Oh okay that makes okay. That's fine. Okay well then how come Para gets the same amount of XP as we do?

Sorry I couldn't help it.

[Speaker 1]
Well I advocated for high levels get half.

[Speaker 2]
So I can I can search these dudes. Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
And I believe...

[Speaker 2]
Damn none of them have the void stuff? Oh there's one of them has a spell book. What is void warp?

[Speaker 1]
Void warp I believe is a cantrip.

[Speaker 5]
Yes it's a cantrip that does void damage.

[Speaker 2]
Uh the robed guy and at the top of the ridge has a spell book?

[Speaker 1]
Yep so the map is free to go as you'd like. You do notice the last guy's up here. If you want to give chase or attempt to track him down that's also the option.

[Speaker 2]
I definitely want to give chase. Susudio will give chase.

[Speaker 3]
Good luck.

[Speaker 5]
Are we all going with Susudio or are we?

[Speaker 3]
Um Klink is not. Um he's just he's good. Klink's good.

Yeah he's just leveled up.

[Speaker 1]
If you'd like to give chase you can go up here. Otherwise we can do like a tracking down later on if you want to follow up after turning to your wounds.

[Speaker 2]
Okay uh I can go up where? Do I just go over to him or?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah if you want to give chase. So are you chasing by yourself?

[Speaker 2]
Uh I mean if nobody else is chasing then yeah but...

[Speaker 5]
Is McCant?

[Speaker 2]
I probably shouldn't. I probably shouldn't uh because I have oh I have where did I get 18? Oh because I leveled up.

Okay what if I do that? Um I'm gonna I'm gonna hit an attack. Ignore it.

I'm just seeing what um okay never mind. I'm not hitting the attack. We're good.

[Speaker 1]
Uh like he's running off screen so if you want to try chase him we can do like a victory point to try track him down. Um there's a reset you know.

[Speaker 2]
And what is everyone else doing?

[Speaker 5]
Um I guess Klink wants to refocus.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I want my focus points back. If you guys are gonna chase that's what he's doing.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah we'd lose him because that's a 10 minute activity.

[Speaker 3]
No you like no Klink is staying behind. He can find you guys later. Like you can go catch him he's just staying he's just not chasing.

Yeah I'm dragging back.

[Speaker 5]
Oh I don't really think Kara would be much help in a chase.

[Speaker 3]
That's exactly why Klink is staying behind. McCannon who is that? Who is that?

Who is that?

[Speaker 5]
James walked away.

[Speaker 3]
Who's shuffling cards?

[Speaker 5]
Who's shuffling cards? Yes you're crinkling.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 1]
That's crinkly like KitKat.

[Speaker 2]
Well if nobody's gonna chase with me I'm gonna start eating it.

[Speaker 4]
Fucking I heard a clang and he pulled the fucking drain catch out of the sink trying to get some like donut sprinkles or something.

[Speaker 1]
It's um magpie season in Australia. It's magpie season in Australia.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
And I've been feeding from the magpies and I keep getting the knock on the door. I'm like who the hell's knocking on the door? And because I've been calling out to the magpies and like giving them meat outside my front door they come knocking my door for food.

[Speaker 5]
We have squirrels that do that.

[Speaker 2]
Adorable.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah except I keep going over there and I think there's like a package like a package dropped knocking the door and just ran off. So I was looking for a package and the magpie was like knocking the door and flew off waiting for me instead of just staying around. I've done it like three times before I saw him in the door like oh it's you.

[Speaker 2]
I watched a documentary today about wild, I don't know. Australia in the city. Like in Sydney I think.

And now I want to go because that's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
There's a cockatiel and they're attacking the rockets. They're like multi-million dollar damage. It's good fun.

And they're like trying to figure out what's causing all these issues and it's got like a cockatiel and it's just chewing like rocket parts.

[Speaker 2]
The cockatiel or cockatoo?

[Speaker 1]
Cockatoo.

[Speaker 2]
Cockatoos are big. Cockatiels are like they can't even bite hard. Pathetic little bite.

McCannon are you going to give chase or are we staying back?

[Speaker 4]
I'll follow your guys' lead. McCannon is happy to look for clues. Nearby area.

[Speaker 2]
Kusasudio is going to chase but not if he's not going to have backup. All right I'm going to make a decision and just stay back with everyone else.

[Speaker 1]
When the case is clear. You know there is quite a few different bodies around. Different sorts of loot.

Gonna be more upset the more you squirm. Don't forget these these weapons are normal size.

[Speaker 3]
That was angry.

[Speaker 4]
I keep flipping you like a turtle until you cooperate. We're like worried about him like he hasn't he had like diarrhea shits and now he hasn't like uh today's the second day I think without pooping. He's like kind of normal after he had diarrhea shit.

Like he's not going to uh it's unlikely that he's constipated. Yeah he still worries me and then while he worries me he goes and gets something out of the fucking kitchen.

[Speaker 3]
I can't imagine why he's constipated. Can't feel the junk he's sneaking.

[Speaker 1]
So you start to scare and drown. You notice the bodies a couple of skeletons you manage to gather the supplies. I think someone grabbed a spell book already.

[Speaker 3]
We got loot?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah they look like the guy's had on them.

[Speaker 1]
I think someone grabbed a spell uh spell uh spell book already. Yeah so the yeah like a wizard spell book.

[Speaker 3]
Where is is it in the stash?

[Speaker 1]
Well that's what I'm saying I think someone's already grabbed it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh okay yeah yeah yeah okay.

[Speaker 1]
But uh I'll check everything else in the stash if you want to just make it nice and easier for you. But yeah so this is the area um you see the corpses of the creatures. There's also the corpse of the rogue guy up here.

And Fred's up there he's like yeah see I told you it was a trap.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
He didn't believe me but I was right.

[Speaker 3]
I believed you. Wow. I totally believed you.

I think I was the only one that actually believed you from the beginning. What's your motive?

[Speaker 1]
He comes over and he uh he looks at the guy over here and he takes the uh the robes off.

[Speaker 5]
That seems kind of weird.

[Speaker 2]
Desecrating a body here? Not that I judged too harshly.

[Speaker 1]
I know like he's taking the the face so you can see his face. Get a get a good look of who you're dealing with.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Oh god I hope not.

[Speaker 1]
All right if you want to add his face to the inventory you're more than welcome. A little bit weird but you know you do you.

[Speaker 4]
No no no no I was making a joke. He mentions he was like taking his face I was like ha ha.

[Speaker 2]
Um he is a dampier is he not?

[Speaker 1]
The yeah he does appear to have fangs. Doesn't look to be empiric. You believe that uh you have heard stories of uh dampiers before and I believe you have.

He almost looks like you.

[Speaker 2]
Not frog, not froggy. Um he's one of my kind kind of. I must find where they're coming from.

My kind are not generally safe to the public.

[Speaker 1]
He asks whoever grabbed the spell book. What does that book say?

[Speaker 3]
What's it to you? Sorry no. Why do you want to know?

[Speaker 1]
Well generally if it's a caster or if he's well versed in magic and if it is a spell book it would normally give some indication of what kind of magic he he's knowledgeable in.

[Speaker 3]
Okay um I think the Simpsons Clink is like the full caster of the group they should use. I guess unless Para wants it.

[Speaker 5]
Uh Para has no use for it. Para does not need to learn spells.

[Speaker 3]
Can I learn these spells?

[Speaker 1]
Are you a wizard?

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a spell book?

[Speaker 3]
I'm a psychic man. My spell book is my noggin. Do psychics deal with the dead?

No. Actually most of our spells suck against the dead because they're all mental and the undead tend to like be resistant to mental and it pisses me off.

[Speaker 2]
Anyway you're already a ghost and like if your power is all about talking to ghosts then that kind of like you could already talk to ghosts. You are one. No I'm not.

[Speaker 3]
This is- Clink is never gonna say he's a ghost. And if he really knows he's gonna be upset that you're saying ghost.

[Speaker 1]
Can I at least- So a psychic does have a spell workshop and when um Oh I actually have like a spell focus thingy. Wait never mind. No I think they're limited.

Sometimes yes.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah they don't learn extra extra spells. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So can I at least read this and understand it even if I can't use it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh I'd get an arcana check.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Let's look at an arcana. Oh god Clink my boy you're so dumb.

Do you want it hidden?

[Speaker 1]
Um sure.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Don't laugh too hard. He has a sensitive ego.

[Speaker 1]
Uh you can judging from the limited information you know from arcana um it does appear to be some information regarding spells.

[Speaker 3]
She rolled low. Oh my god. He'll open the book and not recognize anything and just be like it has spells in it.

That's all you need to know. And he's gonna put the book in his bag. Just because now his like affording protectiveness kicked in.

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't appear to be too advanced in these books but uh yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Um as a we're we're analyzing the book right?

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
I mean as a dampier would I notice anything unusual about it?

[Speaker 1]
Give us an arcana check.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah has your arcana.

[Speaker 3]
Clink would very obviously let the Sissudio look while glaring at the man.

[Speaker 2]
Oh would I have any circumstance bonuses or?

[Speaker 1]
Um if you do a recall knowledge it should add it.

[Speaker 2]
So do a recall knowledge. Get out where that is. There's a lot of things.

Recall knowledge.

[Speaker 1]
Arcana yep. You notice there are a few different kinds of spells in there. Um where'd that spell book go?

[Speaker 3]
Oh it's in it's in Clink's inventory. I did say I took it. I can put it back in the party stash if you need it.

But no no just okay.

[Speaker 1]
So it should be identified now. So you're able to tell there's a few spells in there. Um ranging from necromancy to more trying to get the name of it now.

Um traits that manipulate manipulate people's actions. Things of that nature.

[Speaker 2]
Command. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So you can tell it's got like command, force barrage, grim tendrils.

[Speaker 2]
But other than that there's nothing unusual about it?

[Speaker 1]
No nothing too unusual no.

[Speaker 2]
Well um I guess we continue.

[Speaker 1]
They don't seem to be terribly strong spell casters. You generally know the stronger the casters the more peculiar and dangerous their spell books are.

[Speaker 2]
Do they have any symbols on them? Like uh the the robed guy. Does he have anything on his neck or on his wrist?

Something to indicate a group or a cult?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing in particular no.

[Speaker 2]
In that case I believe we should move on. Are you coming with Fred?

[Speaker 1]
Certainly. I'm here to you know to get justice for my friend. I'll definitely want to to help you solve this issue.

[Speaker 2]
What's your friend's name?

[Speaker 1]
My friend was Jeffrey.

[Speaker 2]
We will find Jeffrey. We will lay him to rest.

[Speaker 1]
As much as I uh I enjoy your optimism I fear that it is. Not well warranted.

[Speaker 3]
All right where are we going to next?

[Speaker 5]
We're gonna try and follow that guy? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So uh as you guys get stuff. Oops robes. So I'm just gonna see if the party goes over there.

And yeah so I'll need a survival trick from someone to see how well you can follow these tracks.

[Speaker 3]
Oh I don't think.

[Speaker 4]
I can do nature but nothing nothing else.

[Speaker 3]
It's actually trained in survival.

[Speaker 5]
Sissudio has the highest.

[Speaker 3]
Okay Sissudio do it. Okay. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. You manage to follow the tracks. And there's a few different times where he attempts to lead you off into wrong directions.

But with your skills and knowledge you're able to follow him back. And you come back to what appears to be the entrance of a cave.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy. Uh I think I have dark vision. Is there anything in the cave?

[Speaker 1]
Um just because if you go in there it might start like new stuff. And I don't think we have enough time for it. Because it's already been about two and a half hours.

If you want we can wrap things up and leave this as a session for next session. Like a start up for next session to come back in this cave with more in force. But if you'd like to investigate like the outside of it.

And I can give you some more information in regard to that if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah the outside.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah yeah. So as you approach the cave you notice it starts to get quite misty and foggy. And it quite conceals a couple of things.

You notice that there are a few creatures outside the front keeping guard. They do try to be well hidden. But as you scout them across you're able to catch a couple of glimpses.

You notice there's at least 10 different creatures inside. It appears to be kind of like their base of optimization in that area. Oh where are we going?

[Speaker 2]
Oh sorry continue.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. You notice there appears to be a variation of both undead creatures. Skeletons of various sorts.

Zombies and humanoids in robes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay um do they have a specific kind of robe that they're wearing? Are they all wearing the same thing?

[Speaker 1]
Kind of looks like a generic black robe.

[Speaker 2]
Okay um how far away are we from where we left these guys?

[Speaker 1]
A couple hours.

[Speaker 2]
A couple hours? Damn I should have taken a robe. I'm a damp here.

I could just walk in there.

[Speaker 5]
But they might be suspicious if you're a frog.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
That is one of their robes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god. All right putting it on.

[Speaker 1]
Inside the party chat.

[Speaker 2]
Putting it on. 100% putting it on. Let me find this.

Let me look at this. Scroll robes? Hell yeah.

Where's Susudio? He's up here. We're gonna put that on and next time don't let me forget that I'm going in undercover.

[Speaker 1]
No problem. So how are you gonna- how are you approaching?

[Speaker 2]
Well I don't want to start a thing if they don't fall for it.

[Speaker 1]
But how would you attempt to approach them?

[Speaker 2]
Oh I would just walk in like I'm supposed to be there.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah as you start to enter in the mist you feel a cold sensation running down the back of your neck and the undead minions they seem to notice you and they don't appear to be too friendly.

[Speaker 2]
Okay wonderful.

[Speaker 1]
Are you going to try to proceed further?

[Speaker 2]
No no I don't think so because I again don't want to start combat.

[Speaker 1]
Okay all right um so yeah so you I'm gonna say something like you'll mark down the location where this is things of that nature.

[Speaker 2]
Set up camp outside a couple hours away or we can just go back to town.

[Speaker 4]
Let's go back to town.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah so as yeah as you start noticing the area you come back you notice that if you head further in you know it might possible that you've missed something. So you've decided to turn back to the party. I'm very glad to see you.

I told you there's something there's something wrong with the group. Probably a bunch of necromancers.

[Speaker 2]
Cicudio suspects a cult.

[Speaker 1]
You know something along those lines. Fred mentions I guess. So what do you say we go get some members and we we come back here?

[Speaker 5]
I think that'd be advisable.

[Speaker 1]
So he he gives you like his little business card to each of you and goes how do you want to proceed from here? Judging that the guards haven't done anything much about it already. Do you feel like we should mention it or do you think we should take care of this on our own?

[Speaker 2]
Take care of it on our own we don't know how deep this cult goes.

[Speaker 1]
That's perfect that was that's what I was thinking too. And then so it's like I'll keep watch over the uh the messengers from Lord Farros just in case I can warn other people of the dangers if they wish to listen. But until then we'll gather our forces we'll prepare and we'll come back hopefully soon and we'll try to resolve this problem.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
To cleanse this cult. Perfect. And he also says to you in regard to the request okay he says if you like instead of returning back to Farros's servant to claim for the payment for this mission if we pretend that we're just one of the people who are affected by him and I'll pay you out of my own pocket to raise less suspicion.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So he'll escort you back to town and he'll give you all the five gold each as promised. And is there anything else you'd like to pay or?

[Speaker 5]
Um Para is going to treat Makanan's wounds. Thank you so much. It didn't give me my healing thingy.

[Speaker 1]
Because you did a medicine check instead of um treat wound thing.

[Speaker 5]
It just it lagged. Okay. So uh he gets 33 back and then for Susudio.

[Speaker 2]
Susudio is okay.

[Speaker 5]
Susudio is okay? Okay then um Klink will get a harm so that Klink can get some healings too. Oops sorry hang on.

Versus Undead. Roll healing.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think he I mean he's down one hit point.

[Speaker 5]
That's fine I just oh if you were down one I guess you'd long rest into a heal.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Oh I hit Makanan with that. That's not to you.

[Speaker 3]
Whoopsies.

[Speaker 5]
Either way. This was a fun little one. It was.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then so if you have any questions or there's anything you just want to do in town.

[Speaker 2]
I get to upgrade my...

[Speaker 1]
There is also the stash that you've looted as well to in the party stash.

[Speaker 2]
You can sell all that.

[Speaker 1]
So?

[Speaker 3]
There might be something Klink wants to stash.

[Speaker 1]
Is there anything you wanted before I turned it into a fennel?

[Speaker 3]
It's all good you'll sell it.

[Speaker 1]
And are you keeping the... Oh there's also someone's staff in there too. I think someone dropped it.

[Speaker 2]
I don't need it. Oh yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I think Susudio's staff should still be in Susudio's inventory. Yes.

[Speaker 7]
Perfect.

[Speaker 5]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
How do I do my downtime to find my radio?

[Speaker 4]
That. So I have to double check. Part of the reason I got that transcription software thing was to check basically where everybody left their stuff.

I don't think that the... I don't think that the flail was moved into a... Was left in one of his inventory.

[Speaker 2]
Because I think he started with that.

[Speaker 4]
He started with a plus two flail. But it wasn't the 411 radio until... a certain time.

Maybe came in at some point.

[Speaker 1]
And so everyone would get the six gold, two silver each from the treasure. As well as the five gold that if you want to add manually from the reward.

[Speaker 2]
What was the... What was that again? It was five gold plus what?

[Speaker 1]
Oh actually James. Six gold we distributed into your account automatically.

[Speaker 5]
We might have...

[Speaker 1]
If you want to add the five gold for the quest reward.

[Speaker 2]
All right, awesome.

[Speaker 1]
And then there's the downtime option. If you'd like to investigate either Sir Pharoah or Fred or Colt. There's also the option too to get some more information about the upcoming...

For our next session if you want.

[Speaker 7]
All right.

[Speaker 4]
So the moment it became the 411 radio was I think near... I'm 90% sure of this. I'm pretty sure it was by...

It was a lake. Yeah it was by the Lady of the Lake.

[Speaker 1]
I hope you had fun and enjoyed the session.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for running. Excited for the next one.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah so it would have been with the Lady of the Lake. And what else were we thinking? Yeah so it's either...

You would either find it again at the Lady of the Lake. Or you would have to find it at... Either have to go back to the Lady of the Lake.

Or if you did add it to a pool then that would make it much easier to acquire.

[Speaker 2]
I could go to the Lady of the Lake. Just on the overall big map. Is there a specific place where he would have come from?

The like flooded catacombs?

[Speaker 4]
That's a good question.

[Speaker 2]
Because there's a cult living in those. And I think that would be a cool plot point at some point. Because they're not very good.

[Speaker 4]
They're not good at what? Being a cult?

[Speaker 2]
No they're just not good at all. They're a death cult.

[Speaker 5]
If that is it for the night I am gonna head out.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah that's it for the night. If you have any questions you want to talk. More than welcome to stay around and ask questions.

Which would help you more than welcome to help.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah I'm gonna head out.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you for joining us for this mission. Hope you had a good time. Good night.

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Uh I will put this in my character creation thingy. If I can find myself. This is kind of um just a little part of...

Quite dark. I felt like I felt that I was entitled to a edgy character.

[Speaker 4]
At least everybody gets one.

[Speaker 2]
He's not he's got an edgy backstory but he's not very edgy. He's kind of respectful so. Boom.

[Speaker 1]
I like the way this character doesn't talk. It's like you have some important information what do you do? Nothing.

[Speaker 7]
It's like well you know.

[Speaker 2]
All right update him. Give him a feat. We should do a poisoner dedication.

Can I do that with my hands or can I? Can I poison people?

[Speaker 1]
I believe you get like hand wraps of the um something. I believe you can poison them.

[Speaker 2]
Ghost eater dedication? Oh that's wild. Start chomping down on clink.

[Speaker 1]
There's some really cool dedications out there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I'm trying to find one that fits him.

[Speaker 4]
It's hard. It's hard to look for one.

[Speaker 1]
Which character is this?

[Speaker 2]
This is Sudio.

[Speaker 1]
Uh what kind of thing are you going for?

[Speaker 2]
Uh he's um let's see. Well he's a dampier. He's a monk.

Um he's very respectful of the dead. And is basically just I don't know um I really don't know. He's kind of just a wanderer.

He hits things if they're if they're mean.

[Speaker 1]
Should do like a corpse tender.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I'm so tired.

[Speaker 1]
Become a cold evader. That's always a good one.

[Speaker 2]
Uh what'd you say?

[Speaker 1]
But cold evader.

[Speaker 2]
Oh there's corpse um.

[Speaker 1]
I think that's rare.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I don't see it uh let's see. I see um I see the corpse tender.

[Speaker 1]
Corpse tender is probably not a good one. That's more of a jest. Nah but if he's like fancy you've got like things like dandy.

So then it gives you a whole bunch of bonus to like deception and society. You become like high class.

[Speaker 2]
Martial artist. Oh so I'm a monk. I can't well that's stack.

Martial artist dedication and monk.

[Speaker 4]
Martial artist.

[Speaker 1]
So the first bonus won't but some of the other ones would. So the first one basically makes your attacks like 1d6 fist. And you don't take the uh minus dual penalty for non-lethal attacks.

But I think as a monk you basically get your own stances and.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah it doesn't look very useful.

[Speaker 4]
I think I think you mostly have access to a lot of that stuff anyways.

[Speaker 2]
A student of water. Are we gonna do any water um stuff?

[Speaker 1]
Yes they're right next to the water. But uh it's quite hard for level ones and twos. If they're not designed for water things.

[Speaker 2]
Following your studies of water your key stirs. If you're underwater you have cover against creatures outside the water. Oh I can like go in and grab people.

I'm tempted. It's not gonna. No actually this looks more useful.

Stunning blows. That looks more useful. Oh I want to go to bed.

[Speaker 1]
If you're like animal trainer you get an animal companion.

[Speaker 2]
That'd be cute. But I think I'm gonna go with stunning blows. And then I'll look at archetype.

Or uh wait was it class? Yeah it's class. I get three things.

[Speaker 1]
You can like do as you do your stances on the type of animal that does the stance.

[Speaker 6]
Browse.

[Speaker 2]
Oh great I get to pick another dedication.

[Speaker 1]
Oh so you you're gonna choose a dedication instead of your class feature?

[Speaker 2]
I picked a class feat but now I get to pick an archetype feat.

[Speaker 1]
I thought that's what you're going for.

[Speaker 6]
I could become a medic.

[Speaker 2]
He has seen many medical things.

[Speaker 1]
Get the uh get the modi class into a droid. And do the wild shape change.

[Speaker 2]
Just become a smaller frog.

[Speaker 1]
And you can actually be the animal of martial arts that you study.

[Speaker 2]
Huh student of perfection. What is this?

[Speaker 6]
Oh okay.

[Speaker 2]
Twilight sticker? Nope okay I'm not whatever kind of elf that is. The undead slayer.

If I do undead slayer that might yeah. I mean his um his whole thing his code is you know don't defile the dead. Don't take life needlessly.

And his his edicts are seek beauty in all things. Respect the dead. Protect the living.

And pursue balance between light and shadow. That kind of fits. Vigilante?

Oh that's so cool. Not that he needs it but that's really cool. Is that what Nova is?

Is Nova a vigilante?

[Speaker 1]
Uh Nova's a um exemplar and I think I don't know I think she's like a magical girl or something as well too.

[Speaker 6]
You could just do like a hard outline.

[Speaker 2]
Undead slayer. I think I'm gonna go with undead slayer.

[Speaker 6]
What you do is you just make like a white. That little white thing. You didn't make the people white and make it look like it's glowing.

Like I can't tell where her pupils are so I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Undead slayer.

[Speaker 7]
I mean I think.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, it's okay.

[Speaker 2]
I could have... I would have had to stay up all night. I would have been more cooked than I am now.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I mean, James, are you able to run a session for three people?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. In situations like this, I generally need a little bit more prep time, so if you want to adventure or go to a specific place on the map, I generally need you to screenshot that place and send it to me. Especially now that you guys have 24-hour access to this.

I guess what we could do in advance... We could revisit your mystery.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, what's up? We could just revisit your mystery that wanted crystals stolen and having people left subs.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you guys want to do that, that'd be fine.

[Speaker 5]
Sure. The crystals stolen thing? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure what happened there, but it was enough to make two players leave the server.

[Speaker 1]
I was talking about the mystery that you and Guston never got to finish. Oh yeah, we can do that.

[Speaker 4]
I'm down to finish.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, though I'm pretty sure the guy is already executed. Just speculating here. I'm not sure if either of my characters have heard news on that front yet.

[Speaker 1]
Well, they were executed when you left. When Mike left Bron Locke, and this is two days later.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
If we're doing that, I'll send Sierra. She has the investigator background, which gives her the... That is not what I meant to post.

No, it is. It's just really long and it has the alignment table. Official inquiry, which lets me get access to cop information.

Some cop.

[Speaker 5]
And I know just the perfect plot hook you can rope us in with. You remember that guy that wanted Majako to clear his friend's name?

[Speaker 1]
He'd probably petition Sierra, given that she's a local lord, petition Sierra for help. Being an investigator would know that it sounds like somebody is getting railroaded. And if there is an assassin mage running around in her territory, it's probably not a good thing.

This is exactly the sort of issue that's appropriate for a local lord to get off their seat and involve themselves with directly. Especially given that Maia's currently out on the job.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, Maia would be good for this, but Sierra can go in official capacity. If that works for me. Yeah, I'm definitely happy to do this if that saves on prep and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm going to just mail my other notes. Coincidentally, it is just the people that were there last time, and me. Plus one!

Nice token.

[Speaker 4]
Right. It's for Grunt Adventures.

[Speaker 5]
Well, my character is a noob guy, so I'm fine with doing this.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we're going to lock it in. I'm going to go use the restroom. Maybe we can put this out here after the snacks are done.

Yeah, I'll be right back and then we'll jump into it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Here guys, now I am prepared because I have... Wait, how do I send something to chat?

[Speaker 2]
If you just click on the picture, it should bring it in. If you're on your character sheet.

[Speaker 3]
Nice!

[Speaker 4]
Because now I have 600 foot range.

[Speaker 5]
Nice!

[Speaker 4]
So for context, Lundy, last session, there was a hill 500 feet away, and I only had 100 feet of range.

[Speaker 5]
Just out of curiosity, roll one shot attack roll.

[Speaker 4]
With the rifle?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I want to see the luck with it you have.

[Speaker 4]
Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Ugh. Well, it's not a misfire.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's good at least.

[Speaker 2]
Make sure you've got ammo is something I keep forgetting to do for Jesse. Yeah, yeah, I have.

[Speaker 4]
Sure. They used one. I have 20 lover action builds.

Nice. I have explosive smoothbore, 18 normal smoothbore, and how many revolver? 36 revolver bullets.

Sounds good.

[Speaker 5]
Sounds very good.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, and I got a decent picture for Mark finally.

[Speaker 2]
Very nice. Since Sierra's going, I'll ask James about getting healing potions because we're going to need them if we get into a fight.

[Speaker 4]
I have four of them. That's good. I bought one.

I also have a healer's kit.

[Speaker 5]
Same here. Not the healer feet, but healer's kit I got.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I do have the...

[Speaker 5]
Wait, let me double check the healer's kit. I think that might be the other guy. Yeah, that's the other guy, but I do have a hooded lantern and oil flask.

[Speaker 2]
Perfect for healing.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, my other guy is the healer, half healer. He's also the one that's got the healing potions. This guy can't afford any.

[Speaker 2]
The trick is that we just don't go down. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
It's fun to burst.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh wait, we're in urban.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I really like your picture of Mark for your character art. Right.

Your gun-wielding rabbit person. I guess it's not as niche as I'd think, but it's not something you'd expect to see. But yeah, it's awesome.

Right? So sad, I got Maya to level 11 and I can't use her. She's away.

Serves me right for playing more than one session.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, thinking on it...

[Speaker 4]
I have an active problem where, like, finally my two characters are, like, close to each other. But one is locked into the quest.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it figures. Who's the knight who's not a token?

[Speaker 2]
Just a knight.

[Speaker 5]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm back. What's going on?

[Speaker 2]
James, can I buy healing potions from Zianna? Would she just have them as, like, a general store? Yeah, at this point, yes.

How much would she price them? Well, I guess it's really up to her, but... Zianna would be fine if I paid the standard, really, so...

How much do healing potions go for?

[Speaker 1]
They go for 50, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
And what about... Would she have anything better, like, greater healing, which are uncommon?

[Speaker 1]
Not just yet, I don't think. Because she's got a... Right now, she's just got a level 1 shop.

[Speaker 2]
I'll buy some stuff for her, then. 50, you said? I'm gonna buy, like, 5.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That would be 250.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It's time to jump into it. So, you folks head on down from Sierra's Keep into Bronlock.

As the first order of business would be to contact Lord Vethin, head constable around Bronlock. Alright. He's not terribly excited to see anybody right now, because his case is going poorly.

But, after a little bit of pressure, given that Sierra's one of the local lords, you were able to get in. Say, well, what is it?

[Speaker 4]
Well, uh... We warned... I warned you that, uh...

You had the wrong victim, and, uh, you didn't listen. So we're here to fix your shit.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that didn't totally keep you from taking the bounty. We are two companions. Wherever they went.

Uh, this is...

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
I'll just, like, shrug and say, hey, you gave me money. I just took it. If you want to give me money, I'm not going to say no.

[Speaker 2]
The money is irrelevant. We are here to right whatever wrong exists, and that is that. So please let us investigate the matter further.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not convinced this lad didn't do it, but obviously you're free to talk to whoever you want. I think, uh... I think the Prancing Kelpie didn't get its due, as far as...

But to my knowledge, y'all didn't... You folks didn't really finish up at the Prancing Kelpie. I did ask around afterwards.

There's been no new murders since, to our knowledge. Everyone's calmed down a bit about the whole burn-the-body situation.

[Speaker 3]
How many victims have there been?

[Speaker 1]
Over the years, we counted... 10 years ago, the final number was something about 50. Now, this latest victim is just number 51.

Sierra, I haven't seen you up here before. I don't know how much you know, but this serial killer was only active about 10 years ago, and then suddenly stopped. Did anyone get out of jail around that time?

Hold on. Uh, what was that? Uh...

No, no, Sierra. Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I think they've started again. That's a running theory. And this person you've found, you're sure that's them?

I'm not sure. I'm confident in it.

[Speaker 1]
I just don't have the proof, is the issue. I see.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. You said they stopped for a while. Was there anybody that was in the jail for any amount of time similar to the stoppage of the murders?

[Speaker 1]
No, we already looked at that. Good thought, but unfortunately, nobody matched that timeline at all.

[Speaker 5]
Well, it was just a theory. Usually, when something like this stops, it means they're A, out of town, or B... Yes, we know what it means.

I figured that's why we checked. I'm saying for my friends here, I'm speaking to myself to get my thoughts in order.

[Speaker 1]
He scrapes his knuckles against his forehead. Uh...

[Speaker 2]
You mentioned the Kelpie Tavern?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, we actually have a little bit more information on that now. Well, somebody was seen speaking with the victim the night beforehand, but nobody ever saw the person that we were speaking with leave the tavern at all, actually.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
They paid for a room. Why don't you talk to the Tavern Keep?

[Speaker 2]
I think that's a good start.

[Speaker 3]
Hi.

[Speaker 2]
And, um, being around Sierra, I haven't described her. I don't think to either of you. She's a very intense woman.

She has dark brown hair. She, um, wears long-sleeved clothes to hide the wolf hair going up her arms. And, uh, she is a woman of few words.

She comes off as quite intense most of the time. A lot of the time it's unintentional, though. But, uh, it is not currently.

I think we should head to the tavern. I don't have... This guy doesn't seem like he's going to be much help other than this yet.

[Speaker 5]
I suppose the tavern would be the next stop. Anyways, I could do with some wings while we figure things out. Thinking food, my friend.

Thinking food.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you guys will arrive at the location... You guys will arrive at the Prancing Kelpie. It's not too far of a walk.

It's about half an hour away from Elven Quarter. As Mike and Jessica... Are you...

Which characters do you have with you right now, Lyon?

[Speaker 3]
Cool!

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I have Mark. You're using Mark, okay. Yeah.

So, let's make it into the Prancing Kelpie. It's midday, so it's not terribly active. The lunch rush doesn't really happen around here until the fishermen get off their boats.

You just have to have mostly to yourself for the next three hours. I would like to sit down at the bar. Yeah, with Mark Ibarraez.

Greet you folks once you get in.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. We sit at the... Well, at least I'm sitting at the bar.

And... Order a drink. To start...

The conversation. So... We hear that...

Things have been amiss lately.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. I think I recognize you from the last time you were here. You were one of the folks...

No, that was my other character. Oh, right, right. Well, pointing to...

Pointing to... What's-his-face. Mark, then.

Yeah, so... I just might wait. Yeah, so...

Thankfully, nobody else has been killed recently, but... I've had some time to go over the... I've had time to go over the...

One room that the fellow was staying in. Not Cyrus, the guy who got murdered. But the...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Let me go back to the logbook. He runs back.

Pulls out a ledger. That probably weighs about ten pounds. Sets it down on the bar stools with a thud.

And says, yeah, so... The day... Okay.

Cool. Yep. It would have been around the 18th of the year.

And I think... Yeah. Okay.

That's when Cyrus ordered his drink. Spam murdered the next day. And...

This fellow... Nice. Spelled...

Nice. I'm pretty sure that's how he pronounced it. According to the other barkeep that was here that night.

Did order a room. Any room in... Hmm.

Yeah, it was one of the crappier ones. It's right next to the storerooms.

[Speaker 2]
And I've had some... Did he specify... Did he specifically want that room?

[Speaker 1]
He just wanted something cheap. And when I mentioned the... Something about the storerooms.

Basically in the back. It's eyes lit up. He looked pretty happy with it.

[Speaker 5]
Has there been any mysterious... Inclusions or exclusions from your inventory in the storerooms?

[Speaker 1]
There? No. Nothing that I took note of.

Everything looks as full as... I checked the next morning. Everything looks as full as it was then.

But here. Let me show you to the room. And if you guys want to go in the storeroom.

I'll show you that as well.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. It just seems like suspicious he'd... He'd light up after the storeroom was mentioned.

Because that sounds like a pretty good place to hide something.

[Speaker 1]
He was pretty thin and pale. I just figured he was hungry. I was expecting to see it eaten by...

Looked like it was eaten by rats the next morning. And nothing happened. He paid.

That's another thing. I still have some of the coins that he took. Or not the...

Sorry, they paid with. I kept them in a separate place. Here.

And he shows you the coins. And they look like they have like... Tiny little crystals embedded in them.

And the faces look like they're made of... Stained glass. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra? Can I make a history check on that? Go ahead.

Just to see if I know where the coins... If I've ever heard of coins like that before. No.

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying to get my character sheet up. See if I have anything that... I'll see.

So, yeah, you can...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can make a history check. Great. I mean, you're aware of the...

Yeah. Not good. It's special, except...

Obviously, you're aware of the... Glassblowers Academy and everything, right? Recently...

Given a bunch of folks recently came through... And paid for supplies... You would know that they had...

Yeah, you had two students from that place. Going by. Going by and paid for some items with coins like that.

But anyways, yeah. So, here's the... Here's the...

Here's the room. It's pretty dingy. There's not much room.

There's basically... There's like a small sink. And a mirror.

And room for a bed. And then, like, maybe... There's like a few hooks for hanging up your things.

But besides that... There's really not much else in there. There is a...

But there is a window that leads outside.

[Speaker 5]
I see.

[Speaker 4]
Do I see a similar prank... In the window as there was to... In the victim's window?

[Speaker 1]
Given that you know what to look for... And the fact that you did discover it prior, yeah. I've...

Yeah, you would notice a similar imprint.

[Speaker 4]
So, anyone know what the Glassblowers Academy actually does?

[Speaker 2]
They made windows for my keep. They also practice magic. It's possible...

Whatever it was described as then... It is... They may have learnt their craft...

Somewhat from the Academy.

[Speaker 5]
I would... Speculate... Based on the...

Timing of the things... They're an older student or... A...

Teacher of that Academy. Just thinking.

[Speaker 2]
What is the imprint that you mentioned?

[Speaker 4]
It's a... A person's imprint. Someone jumped through...

The window... And made an imprint on it.

[Speaker 2]
Like they've moved through it... But it's not broken?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Kind of, yeah. It's like...

[Speaker 5]
They travel through the glass?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the way I imagine it is like... When you... You go through something that's like...

Semi-solid. And so... When you go through...

There's still the outline of your image?

[Speaker 5]
That sounds like it'd be very... Specialized magic, wouldn't it? I don't know.

I'm not sure either. I'm just thinking... This case is leading us to that Academy.

[Speaker 2]
So, James... It's looking to me like... Sierra's prime...

Opinion is that... The two students that came here to investigate... Were here to cover it up.

Which is why they've obstructed... The passage of justice. If that's not something you would like me to go down...

You can tell me now and I'll drop it.

[Speaker 1]
I don't mind... Listen, I don't mind that in the slightest.

[Speaker 2]
If we have to kill them, I'm not afraid to.

[Speaker 1]
That's all I'm saying. No, it's... I'll tell you why that's funny later.

Or maybe you'll discover it... In the session. But...

That's not all. Check this out. He moves the bed over...

And there appears to be... A bunch of... Crawlings...

Or like somebody took a knife... To the floorboards underneath. And there's something of a...

Small map... That's been devised. Was that there before?

Let me tell you, no. I cleaned this up pretty regularly.

[Speaker 2]
What would it mean to...

[Speaker 5]
Try and determine if I recognize... Any of the landmarks on that?

[Speaker 1]
Hold on. I should probably describe it first. So there's...

This map is shaped in a Y room. But it's been turned on its side. There's a small B at the bottom.

And several numbers attached within. There's like... 13...

26... 39... At the northern end...

There's... 50... 37...

24...

[Speaker 5]
Innkeeper... Do you have some... Paper and...

Something to write with? That we can copy this down?

[Speaker 1]
You guys are fine to... Copy it down when you're done.

[Speaker 2]
And at the end of the Y... Sorry, go ahead. Could you just say that again, please?

The numbers.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So at the B, it was... I believe...

20... Yeah. 13...

26... 39... That's at the lower end of the fork.

And then at the top end of the... Again, where the forks split. There's...

24... 37... 50.

At the very...

[Speaker 4]
Uh... There... Sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 1]
At the very bottom of the line... Is the number 13.

[Speaker 2]
The 13's on there twice. For the... First...

Blood and... The bottom? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm...

[Speaker 4]
Those are all the numbers and...

[Speaker 2]
Is there anything about... Is there anything else that's identifiable on the map? Or is...

It's not really... Descript other than... The numbers...

And the fork?

[Speaker 1]
There's a little river... Going between the fork. Going between both ends of the fork.

And then somebody has scrawled a little cloud... At the very bottom of... At the bottom end.

[Speaker 3]
To make...

[Speaker 2]
The arrow would have been in Runlock a few times. Does... That part...

Does the fork near a river... With a bridge or anything... Sound familiar to her?

At the...

[Speaker 3]
Is there anywhere like that in town? There is a... There is a river.

Hmm... River. Ah, I see.

Someone's made a bunch of clouds... Here. Wait!

And you said that... Runlock... Is built upwards, right?

I need you to rephrase that.

[Speaker 4]
So... Is it built on a cliffside or something? Because I remember that...

Last session... The... The buildings...

In front of the building that we were...

[Speaker 3]
Were at a lower elevation. Yes, so it's not cliffside. There's a bunch of hills around.

That some of the buildings are built into. Okay. Just out of curiosity...

[Speaker 5]
Could... This top line... Be headed towards the...

Glass Academy? This one headed somewhere towards... The...

The Cloud... Ravines I think it'd be if I'm looking at the... Angle right?

And this somewhere to the east. It seems like almost a... Web...

I mean a spider web thing where... Or... A webway gate thing or whatever you call those teleportation lines.

[Speaker 3]
Where they... Only this one has branches. Where you stop at certain places and choose your next destination.

I don't see that.

[Speaker 2]
I'm lost on what you mean.

[Speaker 5]
The clouds I'm thinking mean somewhere in the Cloud... Uh... Ravine area.

Because that's south... West of... Bronlock.

And... The others lead to... Somewhere to the east and...

[Speaker 3]
The... Glassblower's Academy. Uh what was that?

Lion you gotta speak up buddy. What? I said Lion you gotta speak up buddy.

Oh.

[Speaker 4]
No I wasn't saying anything like important.

[Speaker 3]
So I was more mumbling. Here I'll put the microphone closer. There.

Uh...

[Speaker 4]
It could be something like a leyline. But why... Would they draw this?

What's with the numbers?

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Or can you just ping where the numbers are on this map? James?

Like just a quick... So it's like... Okay so...

So 13. Down here. One that ends...

Uh in 50. Up here. And the one that ends...

Eve. 39. Down here.

Oh. Oh. All the numbers increase by 13 each time.

[Speaker 2]
The one here that ends in 39. It's 13, 26, 39. Each of it increases by 13 each time.

At the top it's 24, 37, 50. Which is an increase by 13 each time. And the bottom is just 13.

Which is pretty self-explanatory. Can I do an arcana check for the rat? Is 13 important in any magics?

[Speaker 3]
Quite a few. But two in particular.

[Speaker 2]
Roll 10.

[Speaker 3]
Nah. There's a... Uh...

All right, who else is gonna roll? I'll try an arcana roll.

[Speaker 4]
All right, you're probably better at me than that.

[Speaker 3]
Mark, what's your favorite enemy? I'm not a ranger yet. So none...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, 13, 26, 39, 24, 37, 50.

[Speaker 1]
Which of your characters was a ranger?

[Speaker 4]
Mark is going to be a ranger. Right now he's just a clone. I have to level him up.

Okay, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yep. But...

[Speaker 4]
Let me think.

[Speaker 3]
The missing two numbers, I believe, are 26 and 39. No.

[Speaker 2]
No, 13's already in the first line of...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So, they got that already. But it would match the pattern.

[Speaker 2]
Why would they do the same numbers twice, though? Is what Sierra's wondering. I don't...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Start and end. It's supposed to be like a mirror-gate type deal, right?

And gates are both-way. And glass reflects both. And you can see through both ways on glass.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know much about this personally, but...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait! The 13's on its own. It's the center number.

Raya speaks of it.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know much about this personally, but... There are a bunch of students from... I hear you guys mention glass a whole bunch.

There's a bunch of students from the Glassblowers Academy that actually came to the town not too long ago.

[Speaker 3]
On a trip. Excursion. Trip.

Sure, I mean...

[Speaker 4]
Do you know where they're gathered, or... Well, I'm supposed to get a party of them in a few hours.

[Speaker 3]
All right. In the meantime... Okay.

Yes. Sure, if you want to try their hands out as a veteran.

[Speaker 1]
You can find them at... Some of them are probably going to be at the old warden's place. Trying to get advice from him.

You can find a few...

[Speaker 3]
At the... You can find a few at the docks, I bet.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra would like to look at the murder scene. How intact is that still? Has it been...

Because the guy's been taken in? Has it just been cleaned up?

[Speaker 5]
I think he said he locked it down.

[Speaker 1]
He did, but that was partially because there were two people who kept asking to do something that they had specifically not done and had a policy against doing ever since the prior 50 murders.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
But Sierra could probably use some pull to get in. It has not been wiped out.

[Speaker 3]
In fact, we could... It hasn't been wiped clean.

[Speaker 1]
In fact, we could probably speed run a discussion of what you guys found there last time. Because they went through... Let's see here.

The killer did not unlock the door, to their knowledge. The party assumed that the killer had not unlocked the door. Neither had they crept up the stairs.

There was one specific stair that was extra freaky up here. I think it was the second to the last. There was an imprint in the window.

And where the body was found, its back was to the... Somebody had stabbed the body from the back. Sorry, no.

Somebody had stabbed the body in the front and the body had fallen back. And it was facing away from the window. And there were additional two...

There were two and a half, specifically, footprints made in the blood leading away from the body.

[Speaker 2]
And sorry, the stairs for this house, does that lead up a floor or something?

[Speaker 1]
It leads up to a loft. Okay, the bedroom's up in... Yeah, so the bedroom was actually beneath the loft.

But its spot is where there's a big desk, a big workstation, and a large circular window.

[Speaker 2]
And what sort of path is it to get from the inn room to this house? Assuming that the person has moved through the windows.

[Speaker 1]
So this was the person's apartment. This was not their room in the inn. They were found in their apartment by the elven guard.

So normally you would have to go... They're on the third floor, so normally you would have to enter a kind of a guardhouse and walk... A small security feature has a key to it.

[Speaker 3]
And then walk up three floors.

[Speaker 2]
Are there any windows in the guardhouse that show the imprint? Not that you guys see.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. But last time we also discovered, if Mark remembers, that there was a hill with a clear view of the window. Yeah.

So I think that's... Well, we got two of those wizards in custody right now.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe we could ask the constable to ask them about this drawing and see if it seems familiar and if they can tell them us what it's for.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should talk to some of the other people from the school that are in town.

[Speaker 5]
That too. I'm just trying to decide which to do first.

[Speaker 1]
The constable didn't know anything about the glass imprints. You could ask him as such when you guys get access to the apartment.

[Speaker 3]
He doesn't know anything. And the stab? They were stabbed?

Was that the cause of death? Yes. A crystal that formed in their chest afterwards was...

Of course. After death. It's posthumous.

[Speaker 2]
Was this person working on anything in their workshop? It looks interesting.

[Speaker 1]
They were a merchant. According to some of the logs that I believe Mark specifically pulled, they sent about 13 flying carpets. Sorry, not flying carpets.

Smothering carpets. To a wizard named McKeith.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Oh yeah, that is true.

[Speaker 2]
That guy. That's... I've seen that name before, haven't I, James?

Yes, you have.

[Speaker 3]
Ugh. Fuck. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
We need to talk to that guy. He is at the center of a lot of things.

[Speaker 3]
Fuck. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
What information can we pull on McKeith? Or... McKeith.

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
From here? Actually, you know what?

[Speaker 1]
He was recently released from prison. So the constable himself would probably have some information.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Did McKeith possibly go to this glassblower's academy?

[Speaker 1]
Did McKeith go to the glassblower's academy?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, they did. God damn it. Interesting.

How long was he arrested for? Oh, it was a while. It was 13 years.

Hmm. Was he in prison while the murders were happening?

[Speaker 2]
During both sentences.

[Speaker 3]
It was 10 years ago. Yeah. Oh.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the constable's coming in with the records. He's like, yep, we... Let's see here.

Esheros asked us to seize any local assets he had. He had a shop here. It still, in fact, still does have a tower in one of the corners.

He hasn't come to reclaim it yet, but there was... I mean, now that you mention it, there was a break-in reported about 10 years ago. We couldn't actually get inside.

[Speaker 3]
Not the real tower, that is. Was it magically protected? It is.

Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
This is sounding suspiciously like someone stole from Keith something they should not be messing with and have been taking a joyride off it once they figured out how to use it. I'm not sure if McKeith was the original one.

[Speaker 3]
We have no proof of that exactly until we get more information, but...

[Speaker 2]
Why was McKeith released? Did he finish his sentence?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that was about it. Wrongful death. But given the rather dangerous and violent nature of the crime and he was given extra time...

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Now that I think on it, we asked him for help with this case about 10 years ago. We offered him... Well, he wanted his sentence muted, and we just flat-out said no.

[Speaker 3]
Has he talked to anybody since you refused that sentence reduction?

[Speaker 1]
Well, not down here. Escherus is the ones that put him behind bars, but we collaborated, given that he had assets down here.

[Speaker 5]
I was thinking more with curious students or fans through letters or such.

[Speaker 1]
He hasn't come down here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. I was talking about while he was in prison after you refused the...

[Speaker 2]
Prison at Escherus would know that information, not at Ron Lott.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so perhaps we should head to there and get a little more information on him. It's a big journey. True.

But...

[Speaker 4]
I think it's worth it, then, to ask the Glassblower students rather than go all the way to Escherus.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's the play here. We can ask them what to do with 13 years.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And if they don't know, then we do digging into the other. Sound reasonable? Yeah.

I think...

[Speaker 2]
I can't think of anything at the crime scene that needs looking at.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, let's go back to the tavern. I think the students might be there.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Sounds good. Good.

[Speaker 1]
All right. So it's been right about the correct amount of time. You guys go to the...

The constable will leave you folks with the keys to what's-his-face's tower, McKee's Tower, in Bramlock. And we'll then direct you to... And we'll then direct you to one of the banks in which he's...

[Speaker 3]
He had a few deposit boxes held. That sounds like a better second step than going all the way to that other city, but...

[Speaker 1]
All right. So you guys make it back to the Grants in Kelpie. There's a bunch of folks in there.

Somebody had a question.

[Speaker 2]
I was going to ask how's Mark with thieves tools? Very good. If we happen to need to break into a deposit box, would you be able to?

Or does the bank have access?

[Speaker 3]
The bank has access, I would believe.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think banks typically do. I know that banks have to drill stuff if they... Of course, that's in real life.

Anyway, we'll go talk to the students. It's not relevant now. Sorry.

Grants in Kelpie.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Bunch of kids in there with stained glass... Robes with assemblies or impressions of stained glass. Different, like, saints depicted on the robes, or wizards, if you have, like, spell books depicted on them.

Some of them are arranged. Some of them are, like, just the entire robe, and some of them are arranged like patches. They're all having a pretty good time.

[Speaker 2]
Bunch of college kids. How good are the two of you at talking to people? I am not.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not very good, but I'm willing to try.

[Speaker 2]
Decent. Sierra has seven charisma. Twelve.

Going to let one of you take lead in this. We need to ask them about the relevance of 13, and perhaps even if they have any speculation on the murders, the one that's happened recently, the one that's happened previously, and what they know about McKeith and his tower.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I'll add one thing to that, and I'll hop to the bartender and ask it for one of the coins. The glass blower guy that did the scrawling gave him one with the crystals.

[Speaker 3]
That's a good idea. We can just pick a bunch of students.

[Speaker 2]
We'll just pick a bunch of students and approach them, I guess.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what's up?

Hi.

[Speaker 4]
So what brings a group of glass blowers to town?

[Speaker 3]
Do you get a problem? We're just drinking here, man. No, I'm curious.

We're drinking. Mind if we join you in a moment or so? No, you guys are creeping me out.

[Speaker 5]
Well, we do have some questions from somebody, and we want to help clear some friends of yours name, hopefully.

[Speaker 1]
At least I don't, I'm not in trouble. I don't know anybody who's in trouble. I'm going to go somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
They claim to be students at the academy and they've landed in some deep trouble.

[Speaker 1]
He just, he just walks out. Okay. You guys handled that in the worst way possible.

We're trying to find out.

[Speaker 5]
I was trying to find out anything they know to get the guys out of trouble.

[Speaker 1]
Honestly, God, you guys might be better off making a role. You don't know anybody who's at the student, the glassblowers academy.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah. Sorry. Let's make a role.

See if we can find anyone willing to talk to us and ignore that statement because I couldn't have made it.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, you could have made it just flying.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I'm not going to make it though. So I keep on mixing the characters up.

Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
So the guy who's been no, no, not a rewind. There's other students in the bar. You could go attempt to talk to them.

The guy who was to make, to make it clear or to be clear, the guys who were accused of the man who was accused wasn't, wasn't a student of the glassblowers academy.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I thought he was one. The one who was accused along with the other guy.

[Speaker 1]
Neither of them were. No, there was, there was only one person accused.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sorry. My mistake. I misunderstood that session.

I thought the major was from the. Nope.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I take notes. Okay.

Yeah, let the other guy talk to them. Since I failed. Who's making a role.

[Speaker 4]
I'll do it. What role do I do.

[Speaker 3]
Persuasion.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, if you have something that. That matches the skill check better than persuasion or something like that. I'm always happy to hear it.

Or if you have a justification for why you like to use a different. Why you'd like to use a different ability score with it.

[Speaker 4]
I mean. I could use deception trying to seem just like. I'm interested to know.

Why there's a like, because like. Is it normal for there to be a group. Of glassblower students in town or is that.

[Speaker 1]
It's like a, it's like a field trip. I told you guys they're just having like a college party.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I don't know how it works. I don't live there. I'm from earth.

[Speaker 2]
James specifically said they're on a field trip.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but I don't know if it's like a yearly field trip or if they're. It's like, hey, weekends, we go to.

[Speaker 2]
It's like a Harry Potter where they go to the sort of thing.

[Speaker 1]
So, questions like that are a lot less suspicious. If you just ask, look, the parking. If you come up to somebody random, like, what are you guys doing here?

It's like.

[Speaker 2]
Are there more students at the Tavern or have we scared them all off?

[Speaker 1]
No, just just 1 group of them. There's still there's still a bunch of others there. I would like to buy.

[Speaker 2]
All right. And I'm going to try approaching another group before we roll. Watching that abysmal fail.

Sierra is just going to approach another group. They're all students, they're probably poor. Excuse me.

My name is Sierra. I am performing a research investigation on. Well, partially magic and the glassblower Academy, would you be able to help me?

I would be willing to buy drinks.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Well, what would you like to drink before we get started?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, get us some of the. Please see if they got coffee with it.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra meekly walks over to the bar and orders this. How much are they rinsing me for money?

[Speaker 1]
It's it's it's not too bad. It's like 50 gold with the coffee. Okay.

Yeah, I can handle that. It's an Amarato. It's a specifically like an almond whiskey.

It was pretty well coffee.

[Speaker 2]
That was incredible. I'm going to go get this sorted and come back to the table with our drinks.

[Speaker 1]
If you want a real life, it's called the Serrano. It's it's it's not too heavy, but God, it goes really well. And it was really well in coffee.

And you can get it nonalcoholic if you just ask for like Amarato syrup. Like probably about half the same taste, but yeah. So these people, yeah, they look all really excited.

They're happy to see you. When you get back, Barkey comes out with a bunch of glasses.

[Speaker 2]
To the glass blowers, Sierra does a cheer. She'll raise her glass.

[Speaker 1]
They all cheer much more enthusiastically than you do.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra's very out of her element. Now, my research is. There are a couple of things I was wondering about.

I'll get straight to it. Do the glass blowers use. Do they make strange coins that have crystals in them?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, a lot of the, a lot of the students are pretty fond of embellishing their coins.

[Speaker 2]
Was that one or a lot of the students? Sorry, I missed that. A lot of the students.

Ah, that's interesting.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's a tradition. We'll like practice on our coins.

[Speaker 2]
That makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
You'd have lots of targets for practice.

[Speaker 2]
And I really don't know how sinister of a topic this is. But what relevance does the number 13 have in your magic knowledge?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they all start laughing like Jimmy, Jimmy, you failed last year. Why don't you give it a shot? Jimmy, this one really scrawny nerdy kid with glasses.

One of which has apparently been cracked in the course of the night. Oh, let's see. Hmm.

Well, 13 is is a kind of alignment that we use. It's like an alignment system that we use for glass. So if you if you count the number of like when we cast the glass spells, it makes like these these 13 points.

And if you look at the 13 points, you can you could see, like, we'll start from a different number that counts is like the focus for the alignment. And and then it'll go down or up from 13. Like there will be an interval of 13 that we use from the center from the center point.

[Speaker 3]
Would you need to know this?

[Speaker 2]
Are there magics to move through glass? And would that knowledge be relevant for this?

[Speaker 1]
Well, believe it or not, we actually we actually don't. It's it's really dangerous and it's usually not magic that does it. That's that's something that we were we get like an introductory class on other parts that make use of it.

And and psychics do that sometimes. But they like like I said, like that's it's dangerous as hell. We don't we don't even.

We don't even research spells like that, because you're you're pretty likely if you're somebody from our tradition, you're pretty likely to just one of the other older students steps and he's like, you're likely to end up just like a flat as a pain. You screw it up. And it's the kind of spell research where you don't get it right on the first try.

[Speaker 3]
How many psychics are in your school?

[Speaker 2]
Are there many?

[Speaker 1]
Our school specifically.

[Speaker 5]
They're tough to a psychic to join your school. This type magic is so incompatible with the day, please.

[Speaker 1]
They would love to. These kinds of secrets, they're handy as far as sinister subjects go. And he leans in and say, no, they only tell the third and third and fourth years and up about this sort of thing.

So you kids didn't hear it from me. But we're warned about that using the number 13 in chimes and to produce sound based magic. It's the there's there's an overlap between this sort of magic and another.

With the number 13 that aligns with nightmares, the realms outside the realms beyond, as they're called, aberrations can sometimes sneak through if you do it improperly.

[Speaker 3]
That's quite scary. Indeed. Mm hmm.

[Speaker 1]
I've heard so like to do bad here. We use a target number when we're developing the quality of our glass. It goes somewhere between one and 52.

And then from there, we'll have target intervals of 13 that kind of shape the spells effect. It's not it. Most of it's just personal.

You could usually figure out somebody's signature by the way that they do it. And on rare occasions, they'll hide certain information within the glass itself.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to give Sierra the glass coin. Would any of you be able to identify this?

[Speaker 2]
Sure. There's another drink in it. Whoever does it quickest.

[Speaker 1]
I'm taking that. He runs his hands over it for a moment, has an identify spell and goes, oh, this was the... That's weird.

[Speaker 3]
This belonged to one of the groundskeepers. Are the groundskeepers well known at your school?

[Speaker 1]
His face turns bright fucking red. And all the other... the rest of the table goes silent and looks at him.

[Speaker 3]
He's like, well, you know, when you say hi. So, all the rest of the table is still looking at this guy, just waiting for more detail.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra isn't good with people, but she has decent wisdom, so her passive insight would pick up. I think she understands where this is going. How many groundskeepers are there?

[Speaker 1]
The staff is actually pretty extensive. The groundskeepers at our school are typically either rangers or wardens or other kinds of mages in their own rights.

[Speaker 3]
The outer groundskeepers are responsible for keeping the college safe, as well as keeping inventory of our local magical stock, more or less. Interesting. Yeah.

I'm not really... where did you get this?

[Speaker 2]
I recently had some work done at my keep from the Glassblower Academy. It must have got mixed up in the payment and things. She goes, oh, you're Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
You're that Sierra.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that's me.

[Speaker 1]
Well, pleased to make your acquaintance.

[Speaker 2]
If you ever need work outside of the school, you can come to my keep and I can help you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, thanks for buying us drinks. Sorry that we didn't exactly get off to the wrong foot there. I didn't show you the proper respect, but we're charmed to make your acquaintance.

[Speaker 2]
I am not looking for such social conventions, so it's fine. I am... people consider me odd, and, well, I do too.

I do like drinking, though, and I know most people do, so that works.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Well, certainly hit us up if you need anything else.

[Speaker 2]
Well, what do you know about the man McKeith? He has been causing, not trouble, but his name has popped up several times for various things. Do you happen to know much of him?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Jimmy, your uncle's up to trouble again. Your uncle? Yes, my second uncle, or great uncle, really.

I don't actually... I've never met him myself, but he was influential in making sure that I got to the college. Interesting.

Yeah, it's actually my second year here, but I'm starting off as a... I'm retaking some classes. You know, just lots of going on.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm sure you'll do well in time. As far as my uncle, is he in trouble?

[Speaker 2]
I'm not sure. I don't think so. We heard that he has a tower here that he has never come back for.

Apparently it was broken into a long time ago. We think the person who may... Well, the person who broke into it is definitely a bad person for doing such a thing.

They might have had more ulterior motives in there. You don't know how to access the tower, do you?

[Speaker 1]
I could, as long as Arthur comes with me, I think I'd be willing to help you guys out.

[Speaker 3]
That would be very good. Classman gives a nod of assurance.

[Speaker 1]
I'm basically a chaperone of some of the lower groups or some of the younger students here. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Then perhaps we should make sure they have a... Do you have another chaperone with you guys?

[Speaker 1]
If we're taking you? The rest of the table gives you a look of disdain. Anyways, I'd best be getting home as I look at these guys.

All of them start raising their hand like, I'm a chaperone. I'm a chaperone. I'm a chaperone too.

Yeah, we're actually...

[Speaker 5]
I need more drink.

[Speaker 2]
I think they'll be fine.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, they'll be fine.

[Speaker 3]
I just was wondering what the college's policy was, not yours. Anyways, putting my drink to the side. Let's go investigate a tower, see who broke in and all that.

All right, so the upperclassman... So the upperclassman, whose name is Arthur...

[Speaker 2]
What would have Markerol... Sorry. What would have Markerol lived here of persuasion, hypothetically?

[Speaker 3]
Not one, probably. But I will leave... No, that's good.

That would have been fine.

[Speaker 2]
We would have been fine with that too.

[Speaker 1]
But I will leave... Three groups in the tavern for a reason.

[Speaker 5]
What's up, Mike? I would leave 10 GP on the table for your drinks while we're gone.

[Speaker 1]
No, they're all pretty happy with that. Okay, so the upperclassman, whose name is Arthur, asked Sierra if he could talk to her alone for a moment. Sure.

All right, I need you to... There's a lady groundskeeper named Glimmer. That's her.

Glimmer gone. She's the one that that coin belongs to. And I know for a fact, there's no way that got mixed up in the payment.

She's been missing for something like two weeks.

[Speaker 3]
Longer at this point. Unfortunately, you're right.

[Speaker 2]
That did not get mixed up in the payment. Recently, there was a murder in the town, and the person who paid for the room paid with these coins. Whether it was Glimmer or it is someone who has acquired Glimmer's money, we aren't sure yet.

But the reason I referenced 13 is that there was a map under the bed that had three sequences of numbers, with the first being 13, 26, 39, the second being 24, 37, and 50, and the third being just 13. Does that mean anything to you?

[Speaker 1]
Can you show me what it looked like? Do you think we could just take him to the room? No, you guys would have taken notes or something like that.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, we did have the paper. I'll show him the paper.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra would have scrolled down a picture that looks like the map you drew, James. Perfect, perfect. Very simple.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay, so you're throwing shade at me. No, it's fine.

Yes, it's very simple, you know, simplistic, coming from a simple mind. It gets the point across.

[Speaker 2]
Sierra wouldn't embellish it with details, as long as it makes sense to her. That's all she would have drawn down.

[Speaker 1]
So it looks like it's only really half of the puzzle, but the good news is it's the last half. It looks like somebody was trying to figure out a sequence and used whatever sequence they arrived at, led them to... Let's see here.

Yeah, this is not... Okay, so this isn't really from our tradition. But if I had to take an educated guess, somebody inferred the location of, like, a source?

Huh. This is a room that somebody was basically trying to draw on the world. And using an adjacent magical or psychic or whatever tradition to do so.

[Speaker 3]
In fact, if I'm...

[Speaker 1]
He pulls out a map of the maid and says, all right, let's just go by days. What's 13 days away from Brahma?

[Speaker 3]
If I had to follow this line. I don't know. Let's see.

[Speaker 4]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The academy looks like... The academy is 13.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but this is going in the opposite direction.

[Speaker 3]
And what's this little line at the end? These little squiggles? Clouds, perhaps?

Ooh. The cloud highlands. Huh.

Yeah. Yeah. And long.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

[Speaker 4]
And 13 would be somewhere around here-ish.

[Speaker 3]
Around where-ish? I drew a big circle. Where?

[Speaker 1]
No, so that is in the opposite direction of where the...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no, so there's somewhere around... Oh, I was thinking... Would the line end up around here?

[Speaker 1]
If it was 13 straight down, yes. But based off the fork, it travels over for a little bit before the fork. And then it goes down.

[Speaker 3]
Right about in this region. All right.

[Speaker 1]
He's just putting the fork directly on the... He's literally just putting the fork directly on the... I'm going to get rid of this thing.

The fork directly on the... Like, overlaying it on his map.

[Speaker 3]
And adjusting for scale a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
Is the river... Is it safe to assume that's the one that we took down to Bronlock?

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. That means Bronlock would be about... There you go.

Sorry, I'm just thinking I need to look at the map feature again. And meanwhile, just while I let... Sierra is thinking.

You mentioned something about 52. 52 is the limit. 52 is the limit.

Well, we just had the 51st victim. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
52 is the max of the range, wasn't it? There's under 52 for the alignment or whatnot.

[Speaker 3]
It was the maximum, yes.

[Speaker 4]
And you also mentioned that sometimes you can harmonize sounds. And that it could result in abominations or something. Abominations.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you could use... If you're not careful, look at... Actually, you know what?

What's his face? He turns over to Jimmy. He's like, Jimmy, what did you say about...

You're up.

[Speaker 3]
I'm sure you're on deck. And Jimmy says, yep. It could be as...

Sorry, what was your question again?

[Speaker 4]
Would you be able to, with the same concepts you use...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry, it was about summoning. Yes, it could be used for bad summoning, basically.

[Speaker 3]
I see. So you have a motive. You have a place.

You don't know the victim yet. Or the perpetrator. Oh, I'm so stupid.

Whatever. James, did you see what I just whispered to you on Foundry? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
That's there intentionally. It says map end. I honestly don't know what else to call it.

[Speaker 2]
Is it safe to assume that is the right end?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the guy pointed it out on the thing.

[Speaker 3]
And we're just going to change the text color. Okay. I have heard not good things about the cloud forest.

Well, that's for you guys to figure out, but I'm going to be going to... Let's look at the tower.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, let's go look at the tower. Do you folks make it back to the mage tower? It's fairly modest.

Not much of... Nope, I'd say, to pull from it.

[Speaker 3]
The... I asked nicely at the...

[Speaker 2]
What is the police department called in Bronlock?

[Speaker 3]
Just a constabulary.

[Speaker 2]
I asked nicely at the constabulary for entrance to your uncle's property, if we were able to. I have the keys, basically, is what I'm saying. Are you able to grant us further access, Jimmy?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, this one's pretty easy. I'll... Just roll me a quick persuasion check.

Dear God. Yeah. Let's go.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, I'll give you the... I was going to ask you to turn around, but you said he might be stirred trouble or in trouble. I haven't gotten to meet him yet, and I'd like him to be alive when I do and not in jail.

If he's involved with this, did I get your word that you'll use this information to help him out?

[Speaker 2]
Of course, a man of his talents is a useful ally to have.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. Yeah. So, he was born...

What was his birthday?

[Speaker 1]
It was, like, 9-22-35. And that's the... He might have noticed that those are increments of 13, and...

Or starting from nine at the very... Nine is the source, and that's usually how you can recognize his work. And it's also at the basis of a lot of his codes.

So, he goes over to the tower. You guys open it up. It's just what looks to be, like, a regular mage tower.

There's not even a lot of equipment inside. He goes to the back wall. It starts...

Uses a cantrip to produce some glass on it. And you see him moving around these small little motes of light within the glass, casting a bunch of them on until there's not... Off until there's nine.

Something activates. A bunch of motes appear within the glass again. He casts a bunch of them off until he reaches 22, and repeats the process with 35.

And then you see a... The back wall open up. You see a ransacked laboratory, and the actual field...

[Speaker 4]
Well, somewhat clearly broken site.

[Speaker 2]
How common knowledge is your uncle's signature? I assume they would have to know that as well to get in, or is this something you can find out? I guess it is.

Is it readily available here, like it is in other glass? The signature?

[Speaker 1]
It would not be easy. It's not the center of everybody's defenses. And there are other things that...

[Speaker 3]
There are other ways to get around it. I see. But...

[Speaker 1]
It's not something that we advertise. It's something... It's a kind of password that's good to share with friends or family, as it were.

[Speaker 2]
I see. Thank you for your help.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to start looking for any indication of what was stolen.

[Speaker 2]
Am I able to do a perception or investigation for that? Either one. And your teammates are welcome to join you, if that's what...

[Speaker 4]
Yep, I'll help.

[Speaker 3]
I'll aid her in the perception, if she wishes.

[Speaker 2]
I think that would just be you rolling, really. I don't think... I don't think a help action is applicable.

Hot damn, I'm glad you rolled. Wow.

[Speaker 1]
So Thule goes up to the third floor. He looks at one of the quote-unquote windows that has been smashed in. And he notices that the dust here has been recently disturbed.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Taking a brief look around again, you see that another window was actually broken into further. But as you start going over the glass pane that has been broken inwards, you find that there is a bunch of...

[Speaker 3]
You find, looking over it, that if you piece it together, there's the imprint of a person. Hmm. I call the others over to me while we're putting...

to help me put this together.

[Speaker 1]
In the nearby desk, you find the imprint of a rectangular object that used to sit in there.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Probably about a foot by eight inches. One foot long, eight inches wide.

[Speaker 4]
Any documents in the same desk or table? Not in that desk. Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Sierra, looking around the ground floor, finds a lot of reagent bottles appear to have been emptied out. Based on the... When you smell them, they have a relatively similar smell or scent to healing potions, but a little bit more earthy.

Mark on the second floor is going over a number of instruments that are still intact, but similarly finds that they've actually been moved out of place and out of alignment relatively recently. There are places where dust has clearly been disturbed throughout the tower, but even in those places, like the dust has settled back over, we're going over the exceptions here where the dust has been disturbed and nothing else has settled.

[Speaker 3]
Can I try to make some sense of the new arrangement of instruments? Go right ahead. All right.

What should I row for you? Or column. All right.

Oh, no. You got nothing. I would like to ask the party to help me figure out this image on the mirror I found.

Or I explain what I found on this mirror and tell them I think a book or documents was stolen from the desk upstairs. What mirror was it, sorry?

[Speaker 5]
Window or whatever I found that had the image. It was a window. Yeah, window.

I would ask for help piecing that together so we can see the image.

[Speaker 1]
I already explained what it was.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I'm also trying to bring the other guy up so he can perhaps identify him.

[Speaker 3]
Them.

[Speaker 4]
What other guy?

[Speaker 2]
The students. Oh, I think. Can we ask the students also what the implements on the second floor he used.

[Speaker 1]
The advanced student does not know what these are. The younger one should be. He's look, he's looking over his eye.

This looks like a spectroscope, but I am not entirely sure whether it's operation, it looks modified. Looks. Normally this stuff is meant to project light.

A very specific range of light, it looks like my uncle tuned this to an Aurora. Looks like somebody else was attempting to see if they could make use of it. Or look for an Aurora.

What is an, an Aurora, sorry. So you know the, the northern or southern lights, depending on your world. Yeah.

So when we look at those. That's something that my uncle, the great uncle to be a professor for us to. We'd still look or even taught at the school because particularly dangerous.

Especially if you're not experienced enough as far as well passing goes, it's, it's. He tried to recreate a specific tradition of spells basically from the ground up. His own personal twist, and using the colleges traditions.

So if you, if you find areas of particular if you find areas of particular basically with like an Aurora signature on them. Usually you could find magic there. He said once that one of them was moving like a person.

I, that's just in one of his notes that he sent me is. I don't even think he meant to spend it in the spell book that I got but it was like taped or one of the back pages.

[Speaker 3]
Like it just got shuffled in more. Would that I show them the empty space I found. Would that be about the size of a spell book.

Yeah. Oh joy. A master wizard spell book and rather unfavorable hands.

So it's either for sale or someone's using it for purposes that ain't meant for.

[Speaker 2]
There is an impression on the glass window. Are you able to identify who has altered it in the same way you can see the signatures of other gloss or is that not possible. Here's going to point Arthur over to the, the upperclassmen over to the window.

[Speaker 1]
He looks over for basically just gives it a passing glance he's like yeah this is. This is not of our tradition. I can tell you right now, anybody from our school trying to do this probably would have ended up flattened.

Or you would see like little pieces of them and the broken pains here. If I had to guess it looks like a word was triggered whenever somebody entered through the glass.

[Speaker 3]
A word. A word. That's magical protection right.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody from our college or state. You can defend pretty well against somebody from our own college it's why we have the glass system so we can offer is like a standardized password system.

[Speaker 3]
I see. But what if. What if.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry. What is the name of his uncle again, I forgot, Mel Keith.

[Speaker 1]
Monkey. No, there's no Ellen there, in case you want to search up in my key. Yeah.

So if you go m a k e i th. If you look it up in the discord you'll see probably a bunch of results for it is.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 4]
So, if, what if my keys perfected the way to travel through glasses cannot be flattened by using the same principles as this thing.

[Speaker 2]
Why would he. I don't think he'd break into his own study to do that, however. Yeah, I don't think he would.

[Speaker 4]
I think somehow.

[Speaker 2]
Now, using if the person broke into find that information out.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And you said or is light.

[Speaker 1]
To find one information out. How to travel through glass. Mike, I already told you my uncle wouldn't have that information.

Well, whatever it is that allowed them to get in here person clearly already know this person clearly already knew how to do that. Probably.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to sit down and try and wrap my head all around all this magic talk. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Arthur also goes up to the next up to the fourth floor books around like this, it looks like more something else was looted up here. A bunch of scrolls and such, but there's no. There's this.

Whatever imprint came off this one was very clearly from somebody different. If I squint hard enough I think I can see pointy ears.

[Speaker 3]
It's Glimmer and elf.

[Speaker 1]
Glimmer Glimmer is an elf, but this area hasn't been disturbed. Oh, this is the from the.

[Speaker 3]
Nevermind.

[Speaker 1]
And yes, Glimmer is also from the, from the college so she wouldn't have. Step through the glass here.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, she would not suicidal I'll tell you that. You said it's been a few weeks since she's been seen. Where was she last seen.

Academy is you on the grounds.

[Speaker 4]
What if we're looking at this in the opposite direction. Sorry, I got fixated on this. Aurora person.

What if this a lot of person.

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean Aurora person.

[Speaker 4]
Then your, your uncle.

[Speaker 1]
See. Yeah, one of the Aurora's have the have the signature of an actual person. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. What if that is the killer. And made its way to the material plane in some way, shape or form.

[Speaker 1]
This was this predated. The killings but maybe that doesn't mean I mean maybe the. Maybe the killer is.

So, so no, not based off my uncle's notes but. Who's to say that there's that it couldn't be him. Like who's who's to say that we can find them.

That the same signature was on them.

[Speaker 3]
Jimmy Do you know what happened specifically that put your great uncle in prison. He was, he was testing Aurora Matt. And this ended up supposedly killing somebody.

Who is just one of those, you know, test subjects or whatever. And is there a way we can find out who that was. It sounds like a powerful spell but our brain.

[Speaker 2]
And this happened he was arrested immediately after that was wasn't he.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. And then three years later to kill someone broken to his tower and the killing started.

[Speaker 3]
Now, this would have been the information I asked the warden.

[Speaker 2]
The, um, how long did the initial killings go on for the ones 10 years prior.

[Speaker 3]
Probably about a year. Okay, those 50 about one a week. And then it stopped.

It was pretty good. And then now that he's released the killing start again. Maybe he didn't kill the person, maybe.

He's the Patsy.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't know what that means, but maybe my uncle McKeith isn't being accused of murders.

[Speaker 5]
No, we're thinking someone may have framed them for that other murder number accidental death.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that was the trust me that was absolutely him.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, but maybe he didn't kill the person maybe the person went out of phase.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that person is pleased that person is trust me when I tell you. That person is very dead. There was a lot of pain made over this with regards to my family.

[Speaker 3]
All possibilities will drop it then. That'd be interesting. That person.

[Speaker 2]
I'm very curious about what's in the cloud forest of the map. I'm not sure what else to make of McKeith's tower.

[Speaker 3]
All I know from it is someone's got spell book that probably he makes them feel a little big for their britches, because from what I am hearing McKeith was a pretty powerful wizard so With the cloud forest, Jimmy give that be a good place to perform this Aurora creation. I what exactly are you asking. I'm suspecting.

[Speaker 2]
Nevermind. Sierra's finished here I think she's exhausted everything she can think of. We need to look at the end of the map, which is a long journey.

Well, no, no, tell me, tell me what you're thinking, but Someone recently someone has broken in here. They have looked at the implements for the Aurora. Well with spectroscopes and whatnot.

[Speaker 1]
So the spectroscope just shows you where they are.

[Speaker 2]
What information, would someone get doing Aurora's. Would that be beneficial to them.

[Speaker 3]
Anyway. Would that give them power.

[Speaker 2]
Is there any reason to do this, other than, like your uncle was researching or it's powerful magic.

[Speaker 3]
I mean do you want me to look. Yes, please. Okay.

I could do that.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys look over by the thing that says convergence. Can you see a new icon there. Yep.

Yeah. Yep. And what does that confirmation.

What does that say. Aurora signature. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but what is. What does an Aurora signature do. Doesn't do anything specific it just shows you.

To see how to populate the map. Right, there's one at each part of the arc is there. Oh no.

Okay. There we go. Sorry.

That's wrong. Yeah, one more on top of that. There's a way to make a little bit.

There's a bit tricky spotting. Oh, that is. In any case, let's just make sure that they were.

Yeah, so there's a bunch on the map now. I see that.

[Speaker 1]
This was this was only a partial read. This isn't looking at it. This looks key to the alignment of the moons.

So, I didn't it looks like I didn't grab everything.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if grabbing everything is really even possible, but we could probably check back and. Oh, we'll be able to check it regularly.

[Speaker 2]
You have indicated there's a signature at the where the map ended. Does that mean anything to you? I am not sure what to make of that.

[Speaker 1]
Just means just one of these light sources behind the.

[Speaker 3]
Find that place. Something associated with it. Well, I suppose the only way to see what's going on there is to go there.

All right.

[Speaker 2]
That is a long journey to make I hope it is the right decision but I too think that is what is needed to be done.

[Speaker 3]
Wait. Tonight.

[Speaker 4]
Probably, that's something but Can I try to see if there are any, if I recall, any stories or tales about Northern Lights, like myths and legend?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you are a Fae. There are more than myths and legend. The local, the Fae court that used to rule here son's blessing came was known as the Hyborial Court.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, all right.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, let's go. And one in particular, let's see here.

[Speaker 3]
Probably the most notable associated with the Northern Lights would be is a Fae known as Thresia. She's specifically known as a Lord of the Northern Lights and a rather powerful illusionist. I guess we're traveling to that godawful forest.

Do I know if Fae have any, like, any connection to, like, mirror worlds or glass? Or is that a stretch? I mean, maybe?

I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Are you trying to, I highly recommend it for research downtime action.

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'd say we're done here and we need to research other areas. Why don't you guys agree?

[Speaker 4]
You also need someone to make sure no other of those murders happen somehow.

[Speaker 3]
We'll discuss that with the constable when we report what we found currently. I'm not sure how we can stop it when we aren't sure who's being targeted. Or we don't have a real suspect yet either.

You're right. Well, best we can do then is go to the highlands. Go to that point.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Maya recently went into the Cloud Forest.

[Speaker 3]
There were shadow creatures there that have long arms and kill people. What? It's some sort of...

[Speaker 2]
They're not a legend since they witnessed it, but there are creatures in the forest that are supernatural.

[Speaker 3]
We should be very careful if we're going into the Cloud Forest. All right. Okay.

Oh, yes. I should have mentioned this before. Are any of you spellcasters?

No. Okay. I had to go to the scroll of fire.

I can't use this. And could I declare a 10 minute break when we get to one?

[Speaker 2]
We plan to take a break whenever.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out if we're to the point where we need to figure out our travel plans.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I feel like going to the aura is a session in and of itself, right?

[Speaker 3]
It could be. So then that would be session, I suppose.

[Speaker 5]
Because we don't really have any more places we can research here.

[Speaker 1]
How are you guys planning to get to the signature?

[Speaker 2]
We could get some of the remaining white dragons before we have to send them back to Corrigan from Sierra's Keep. There you go. They only took half of them to the Isle of Dread.

Isle of Dread's a really cool name. Yeah, we could take the dragons, so it'd take us a few days to get to the forest and back. We could land on the backside of the forest.

I don't know what these green X's behind it. Is that like swamp or? It's like jungle.

Jungle. Okay. But it should be...

The aurora should be pretty easy to find since it should be above the tree.

[Speaker 1]
Remember, it's a signature. It means that there's something... There's a place of power associated with that.

[Speaker 3]
Would that work for like meditation? Yep. That's sick.

I wonder if that's what they've gone there to do or something similar.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to report back to the chief, the warden, or whatever title they had of the... Hm. And so we'll tell them we got into Macheath's tower.

We can't really know what was stolen until we talk to Macheath or find the perpetrator. Someone has been in there recently as well. We tell them that...

Macheath's... We told them that what we found, that there was hampering of his implements and things. We talked to the students.

[Speaker 3]
We found... Do they even care actually?

[Speaker 2]
Are they interested in what we've found? The... Not detective.

[Speaker 1]
Well, tell me what you've... What detail... They're very interested in the fact there was a more recent break-in.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. We tell them about Macheath's tower and the break-in and what was tampered with there. The missing possible spellbook.

And we tell them we have found the person who made the coins crystallize that were paid for at the inn. We know that that was done by the glimmer person from the school, the groundskeeper. And they have since gone missing.

And we tell them about the map and the auroras. And unless they have any suggestions... We're going to tell them everything we've found.

And if they have any suggestions, we're going to investigate the aurora signature. See if there's anything happening there. Because that's our best lead.

[Speaker 3]
What abouts would you say that this... That this other break-in occurred? The dust was unsettled recently.

So...

[Speaker 2]
It can't have been too long ago.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think that Freeze, our primary suspect...

[Speaker 3]
This sucks. Who was the primary suspect, sorry? Uh...

This is a fella named Joe.

[Speaker 1]
Jeff. So there's Joe and then Jeff. But Jeff isn't with us right now.

But he didn't arrive to Brownlock except by ferry. And it's pretty clearly recorded.

[Speaker 3]
Well, he'll be happy to know that we have...

[Speaker 1]
You guys would probably be able to settle a rough range for a rough date. And it's like, this guy would have been out of town at that time.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Is he the one they accepted the bounty for?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. It says you two, on the other hand... You better find me this killer in the next month.

[Speaker 3]
Or else I'm coming for that bounty back. Duel is not Majako, but understood. For Tusk care.

He just points to Faith.

[Speaker 1]
No one's lit on a ward. That's a way Perceptive Sword can see that his glasses are on his desk.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
We have a month. How much time would it take to get there by dragon?

[Speaker 3]
Four? Five? Seven days?

Seven days, I think. Like a dragon. Yeah.

All right.

[Speaker 4]
So, is that something we want to do today? Or is that a...

[Speaker 1]
We could take, tell you what, let's take a short break.

[Speaker 4]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
And then, well, what are you guys feeling right now? Because we can end the session here. Then next time we get going, we can pick it up on something a little bit more energetic.

[Speaker 5]
I'd say we end here so we can do prep and maybe have more people in the party.

[Speaker 2]
I was going to bring Jesse to the forest if we went today.

[Speaker 3]
He isn't doing anything. Yeah, my plan was to, if we're going to...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, no. Like for me, it's just that it's getting a bit late.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, it's fine. This will give us a plan to a chance to regroup with what we think we should do as well. We have a month to get the killer.

The 52 thing that you mentioned, Lionheart, that's an interesting one with the 52 killings that could happen.

[Speaker 3]
Mark mentioned that.

[Speaker 2]
I was referencing the player, Lionheart.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry, my brain is fried. It's so good.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm stumped. Sierra's good at mysteries, but this is beyond her with the whole psychic element.

[Speaker 3]
If it was just a glass blower doing it, would you go?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I feel like we missed a huge clue. And James is like, oh my god, these fucking guys.

[Speaker 2]
I just can't think of who the psychic could be. I don't know. We could try getting into contact with Malkith, but he was last seen, I think, to the north of Asharis.

[Speaker 4]
If you want someone to get in contact with Malkith, you could send Dustin.

[Speaker 3]
He's not doing anything.

[Speaker 2]
It's just the problem finding Malkith requires getting to Asharis, and that's even further than the forest.

[Speaker 3]
Now, you guys can take a ferry up there, which will take you folks about a week. I think it's less than a week, depending on the ferry.

[Speaker 2]
Would it be quicker to wait for Maia and Para to get back and then take the airship?

[Speaker 1]
That's right, because they're holding the airship right now.

[Speaker 3]
They, uh... Yeah, they're teleporting the guests to Sierra's Keep.

[Speaker 1]
We couldn't teleport them. They have an airship. So they get back on the 13th, and it's the 10th for you guys.

[Speaker 3]
So yeah, I think we're going to end session for now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but they're discussing a next course of action.

[Speaker 3]
Take the airship or the dragons over?

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, they're debating whether to go to the place marked on the map, or to talk with Malkith first.

[Speaker 3]
I'd vote for the marked area on the map, and then we can go to Malkith afterwards.

[Speaker 2]
I actually think we do both. We can send Guston and maybe Maia to Ashurus as soon as Maia's back, and we can take the airship to the forest. I think we wait three days before we leave, at least.

Maia needs to go to Ashurus anyway. She needs to talk to Ashurus about planting coral seeds and fortifying the Coral Spire.

[Speaker 4]
And Guston going to Ashurus gives him an excuse to prepare a raid on Izgirth. Sick. Because Paladin going to attack an incremental fortress?

[Speaker 2]
Heck yeah. We can plan and do that sometime in one of the future sessions. And so once the airship gets back, we can send Jesse, Sierra, either Majako or Thor, or both.

And Mark can head to the forest to look at this convergence.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so we got two sessions planning up.

[Speaker 2]
Not even two sessions. I think Maia could cover the look into Malkith in a downtime action, maybe.

[Speaker 1]
That's the purpose of it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So, I think, unless either of you have a better plan than that, I think that's the way to go. No.

Sounds good.

[Speaker 2]
Of course, Mike, you can send one of your characters up to Ashurus as well if you would like. I think... Maia and Guston should have it covered.

Unless they get into trouble, which Maia tends to.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'll send Thor up with the two up to the other city, and send Majako to the convergence.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty, I'm going to write this down.

[Speaker 2]
What was Baro's character's name? Kiruna?

[Speaker 3]
Kiruna.

[Speaker 2]
Kiruna? Kiruna, yeah, probably.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I feel like I've been mispronouncing it. Kiruna.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, maybe it's just in the character sheet. It is, they posted their picture. Kiruna, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Kiruna... Maia... Guston...

It was Thor heading up to Ashurus.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, actually, we can head to Ashurus with all the dragons to return them. If Gargan would like them back.

[Speaker 1]
I think he's looking for them next, let's see here. You are going to get a missive today for your diplomacy pouch that he would like them back on the 25th of Tainan, which is next month.

[Speaker 2]
Next month, okay. We can, we might hold on to them, oh, well we might as well, is flying quicker than the ferry or is the ferry quicker than, the ferry can just go the whole time, can't it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the ferry is actually quicker because you don't need to, it doesn't need to rest. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Can the dragons ride with us on the ferry?

[Speaker 1]
Not usually, you need a specific charter for that.

[Speaker 2]
I might actually ask Para if she can teleport us to Ashurus and back since she can do that at will. She has a circle in both Ashurus and my keep. So I might shoot Otter a message about that.

So the current plan is to travel up by ferry. I'll post all this in the Foundry chat.

[Speaker 1]
I've also entered another note in the simple calendar, which I think you guys are allowed to view, right? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I had somebody tell me that they couldn't see it. I had no idea why.

But yeah, I've also added a note, so I added a note for the 25th of next month for when Corgan wants dragons back. And I added a note for the...

[Speaker 3]
Oops. Oops what? I thought that was the event thing.

I'm looking for it. I can't see it.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
That's the 25th of Tainan.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. I'm not seeing the events.

[Speaker 1]
Mike, I need you to be quiet for just a second here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then for the 21st of the next month, you'll see when the two students that you were talking to get off for summer break. They are interested in following up with you.

[Speaker 2]
I don't see these notes in the calendar, unless I'm looking. That's the 25th of Tainan. The dragons wanted back.

There are no notes for this date that I can see. Okay, so that means that there's something with permissions here. Maybe it's like a GM note.

Yeah. I can't see anything about that, but it wouldn't make sense to give me permission to see GM notes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. So if I click who can view, I can edit that, it looks like.

[Speaker 3]
I get set to all players every time. All right, cool. Edit, view, all players.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yes, I see that now. Oregon wants his dragons back. Oh, yeah, but gives a little notification for each date that has a note.

Okay, that makes way more sense.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Arthur. Yeah, we can maybe try and get a parrot come with us to the Aurora signature pair is very useful.

Okay. And as for playing.

[Speaker 2]
Next, I'm pretty free for the next few weeks, but there will be one day I'm not available at all.

[Speaker 5]
I'm pretty open as well.

[Speaker 2]
If I know if you'd like to try and schedule another session we can do something that works for you. If I know ahead of time to wake up at 4am I can, I can do the initial time that you had set for this one I would just need to prepare mentally.

[Speaker 4]
It's fine, it's fine. I can, I can make a more reasonable time. It's hard to find.

Wait, are you in Australia or New Zealand, Australia. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
But, um, yeah, if you post whatever works in the session times for you I'm happy to tell you what works for me, based on that will go like this. This was your session I kind of hijacked it for your other session. But, yeah, I'm definitely happy to work with you, whatever works for your time scheduling.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll try to find a time that works for everyone.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, I'll, I'll post it here. So, yeah. Cool, cool, cool.

All right.

[Speaker 1]
I will see you guys later, Graham.

[Speaker 2]
See you later. Thank you for running, James. Thank you for running.

I am sorry for being bad at mystery.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. No, listen, I feel like I have to retrain people when it comes to mysteries and stuff like that because the base assumptions of the game are bad for deciphering them. I'll say the one thing that you guys were good at is when it comes to honestly as far as I'm concerned mysteries are like social encounters, mostly.

There's no way for like you to look at the murder scene, for instance, without me giving a bunch of details. But there are, there is a good way for if you folks keep an ear out for us and look for people or listen for people who seem to know something about something. Usually that like that's, that's your best way of picking up clues, and that's, that's how I tend to run it anyway, is that clues are, clues are nested in people.

And if you find people generally you could, you could get them to reveal whatever clues you have because I don't have a lot of resources for running mysteries otherwise and something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm just not sure who to get further clues out of other than McKeith and Glimmer, and they're the big ones that we don't know where Glimmer is, they're missing. I guess, maybe Sierra will spend her downtime between now and then, looking into Glimmer, if that's something she can do.

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
No, Jesse will do that, he'll use the ask around research action because he has charisma modifier.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's his deal.

[Speaker 2]
All right, now we're cooking. All right, so I still need to get to Jesse's meeting with the Matriarch. Can I defer that to later?

Can I have a meeting with the Matriarch at a later date? Yes, absolutely. I'm not holding up the Shackles channel.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, because what you guys need to do is you need to talk to Tanetta. Or not Tanetta, sorry, you need to talk to Talosim.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. You brought back the... Yes, yes we do.

The Fae.

[Speaker 2]
The what? We unchained a Fae.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Where? He was being kept at the bottom of what could be a volcano, and we let him go. He is willing to talk to us.

He wants to talk to us a lot.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
So, where did you say this Fae was?

[Speaker 3]
The island volcano.

[Speaker 4]
All right, so, uh, slight detour when going to the Cloud Forest. Cockscum.

[Speaker 2]
Well, luckily for Mark, we're bringing him back to the Keep for your viewing pleasure. Do not kill him, please. We need him.

[Speaker 4]
I'm joking. I have to figure out which port to swap Mark over for him to be so hateful towards Fae.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to post what's happening in the downtime. I've missed out on doing previous ones, so I don't care about that. I really...

I need to talk to the Matriarch and get resources to build my Dragon Incubator, but that can come later.

[Speaker 1]
And we could always do that over voice if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
Sure, that would probably help. Sierra would, like, she would be keeping her dragon egg safe, if that makes sense. Like, it wouldn't be progressing, but she wouldn't be killing the egg, if that's possible.

I assume dragons are pretty sturdy, like, compared to chicken. That's all I really have for reference.

[Speaker 1]
Dragons don't have, like, a same biological timer. That's something like that. You incubate a dragon egg by putting it on a pile of gold, rather than treasure.

[Speaker 2]
Which she will do. And, like, yeah. She'll keep it with a bunch of treasure.

She knows that much. And she'll get further details from, to build a proper incubator from the Matriarch when Jessie talks to them. Maia would like to talk to them about turning the crystal into a weapon to nuke House Kain, committing war crimes.

And Jessie would like to... Oh, that one! Yes, the one that's still at the Spire.

Perfect. And Jessie would like to just find out about House Kain, because they could be problematic with how much they know. But that's what will be discussed with the Matriarch for now.

Jessie will be using the Ask Around research time to find out about Lima. Tiara will be de-stressing before going into a stressful situation. She is going to do herbalism to get a herb to get some temp HP before going to the forest, I think.

I don't think she...

[Speaker 1]
It's her best shot at taking out a hide-behind. And keep in mind, who has that Driftglobe, by the way?

[Speaker 3]
Para does. Already. Wait.

Para probably does.

[Speaker 2]
Para tends to have those. Oh, they haven't gotten back yet, so I guess they would decide on...

[Speaker 1]
The second Driftglobe is with Wayne and White.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. If Para's not coming, I'll ask her for the Driftglobe. The one that protects us from the...

[Speaker 3]
The hide-behindsters. Yep. Terrifying.

That was so good. God, I fucking loved that session so much.

[Speaker 2]
The fuck was I about to? We got him good.

[Speaker 3]
There was no...

[Speaker 1]
The newbies missed all the high notes. Plus 19 to Dexterity saving throws. Weird.

I love my Monster Hunter-style descriptions of native life. Where they're just, like, regular life, but slightly off.

[Speaker 2]
There's enough to unsettle Maia, that's for sure. There's a question, like, do elk normally sound like this?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, elk and moose sound fucking terrifying. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm Australian, we have kangaroos. We don't have either of those. Yeah, no, no, so...

[Speaker 3]
And kangaroos ain't terrifying?

[Speaker 2]
Nah, they're cute. Kangaroos don't sound terrifying. They'd kick the shit out of you if you got close to them.

But, uh, they're mostly silent.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm talking about... Then buy a kangaroo, and you'd be terrified.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. But as far as the North Americans, it's... They scream.

But it's in a very high-pitched and nasally voice. But as far as those... Not to mention their size.

Like, they're huge. They're... I mean, they're huge.

They're close. I slapped a moose on the ass once while I was there. It was really fun.

We were driving next to it in a car. Like, this small size, my passenger sedan.

[Speaker 3]
You do realize moose can outpace some cars? Very aware.

[Speaker 1]
Because its reaction to that was to dive in front of the vehicle. And how we got out of that without any damage to the car, I don't know. Well, I have a rough guess, which was...

My passenger... That specific passenger was huge. And so when he stepped on the brake, I imagine his foot just hit the asphalt.

Went through the bottom of the car to stop it. But we got away with only... But no, moose runs are fun.

Because they will run alongside the vehicle. Just on the road. It's something of a problem up there.

Because if you're in a... Sometimes logging trucks will kill them. By just running into them.

And sometimes smaller vehicles will suffer a lot of damage. And the moose will be relatively okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, don't they cave in vehicles? Engine into people?

[Speaker 1]
Not into people. But your car is going to be totaled after that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. That's a little worse than hitting Bambi.

[Speaker 1]
Folks, I'm going to go check in on some brisket. And I'll be available for the chat. Let's see here.

Lionheart and Mike. If you folks want to make some extra XP, I am looking for folks to write up session reports. For stuff that happened during the session.

They do not have to be total or complete. But I'm going to start offering XP bounties for folks who do so. I kind of got lost on the mystery.

It is a great incentive. And a great way to take notes during the session. Which will probably be pretty helpful.

Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
Would you be open to creating a Discord channel for session reviews?

[Speaker 1]
For session reports? Just put them in... Tell you what, you can make a thread in...

I'm going to make a thread.

[Speaker 4]
Just because I don't like to feel like... I'm using people's... Hey, look at this.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're fine, man. Don't even worry about that stuff. Plus, I'll be using them to...

More or less ghostwrite... The session reports that I post on the blog. Then I'll be using them to...

And they'll also get posted. Not only will they get posted in the thread. But they'll also get posted on Newsfeed.

And you'll be able to see them there. I'll just fill in details that you missed. Or stuff like that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll write up a report of the session. That we just did to the Isle of Dread. That would be fantastic.

How do you spell the Thay's name that we rescued?

[Speaker 1]
I believe... Let me check. I think there is an errant E in there.

Which is very necessary.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. Lenny, do you have any idea... What the decline at that E is?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I bought a Pegasus after that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. They're literally like...

[Speaker 4]
An academy for raising animals?

[Speaker 2]
They're a magic academy and they specialize in... Like horse stuff.

[Speaker 3]
I see. I see.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we traded two unicorn horns to them. In exchange for a Pegasus. Which was Jesse Hess.

What's the fly speed on a Pegasus? I think it's like 90 or 60 or 90. It's pretty good.

It's faster than the dragons, damn. I should be taking that out. But I don't want it to die.

It is not as healthy as the dragon.

[Speaker 1]
Put the barding on it. And the saddle and such.

[Speaker 2]
Give it the diamond armor.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, so you guys found... If you look on the...

[Speaker 2]
There was the barding, there was the... Yeah, I was going to use that for the cobalt dragon. But I think it's okay without it.

I will use it for the Pegasus. I assume that the equine academy... Would sell that sort of stuff too, wouldn't they?

Yes, they would.

[Speaker 1]
Their specialty is fixing 5e's fragile mounts.

[Speaker 3]
It's the only reason these dickheads exist.

[Speaker 2]
Incredible. Alright. In that session was Mijako, Karona, whose name I've forgotten how to spell, Hera, and myself.

[Speaker 3]
God, Mike can fucking talk. Mike can talk a lot.

[Speaker 1]
I'm happy that I got to have a session with him. Or two sessions with him now. Because I used to think he was really annoying in the other D&D server.

But he does have a little bit of a... I think... I don't know if it's an input delay or something like that.

But he does have a habit of just kind of like following his... Mind. Following his impulse.

To speak. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And part of it's like an instinct to roleplay. Where did that thread end up at that you just... Oh no, it's in the Googly channel.

I found it. Karona, Maya, Mijako.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, James. Is our... Our diplomat pouches part of becoming a minstrel or is there something I have to buy?

[Speaker 1]
There's something you have to purchase.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think it cost too much when Jesse bought one.

[Speaker 1]
Thank god I love that Matt Colville made those. I need to figure out a way to include them in Shillmas Valley without ripping him off completely. I honestly for that one specific item I do not mind ripping him off.

But I mind running a foul of copyright. Yeah. In fact, maybe what I just say is diplomat's pouch.

What happens if I look up diplomat's pouch on the internet?

[Speaker 2]
Just look up a synonym for diplomat. The emissary pouch.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the issue is if I reference the item I think it does come up. Maybe I just say hey, your item is in the source book. Or I just put a note about communications devices.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's just like a negotiation kit or something.

[Speaker 2]
I am going to write up a report of the island trek.

[Speaker 1]
That would be perfect. I would be happy to give an XP budget that you're I'll just give you an XP bounty and you could decide who to use it with.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll just do walls and walls of text now earning XP. Perfect. Yeah, the XP will probably go to the character that was on the session to keep it simple.

Then I'll split it.

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'll be the belts.

[Speaker 2]
Is that the man, the myth, the legend?

[Speaker 1]
It's me. It is. Finished work at last.

And my sprint doctor's appointment. And, uh, like half of the map. And by my powers combined, I'm definitely not ready for a full session, but for a dodging crawl, I can manage.

[Speaker 2]
I might not be ready for a dodging crawl.

[Speaker 1]
Well, none of you have been ready for a dodging crawl for a very long time, it feels like. But it keeps taking too long to, uh, change rooms and to keep on dying? It's not that bad.

[Speaker 2]
I might actually have to choose between D&D and The Girl. This is crazy.

[Speaker 1]
That's not really good.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's not actually a choice. It's actually a pretty easy choice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, D&D. The exciting part. Navigation, navigation, curious tomb, good island.

Let me leave those two up for the moment. Let's take, uh, training down for a moment. There we go.

And I bet I have to put that star event thing for everybody. You want to make sure that Chizu gets in here. Yeah, I'm going to be interested to see, uh, basically which level you guys play on this time around.

I don't know if we're going to spend a lot of time on the upper levels.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, my character is real white. Your character what? Uh, it's real white.

[Speaker 1]
I, no, so I did not hear what you said, um, or understand what you said.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I said my character is just, uh, wait, did you hear me? Because I didn't hear what the last word was. I didn't understand it.

Oh, eight, the number for the level.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, level eight. Okay. So, I mean, like, Sekiro is what, level nine at this point?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no, actually still level eight.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit.

[Speaker 2]
I, I've been, uh, displaying XP between, between him and Vrak, so it's been slower.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you're not supposed to split the XP. He's supposed to just get, um, whatever you get, you're supposed, your companions get, your companions split an amount equal to like half.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, um, hmm, that does change.

[Speaker 1]
I imagine it would.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if I'd be level nine, though. I still don't know if I'd be level nine, um.

[Speaker 1]
And the other problem was that you just weren't getting a ton of, uh, high XP sessions.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know how much XP I'd have right now. Because I've been doing it completely wrong.

[Speaker 1]
Slowbro, we got Bayonet. Why did Fallen say interested? Fallen is not going to be able to, uh, yeah, I'm going to tag him anyway.

[Speaker 5]
After that, I'm just going to wait for people to log into the Foundry. Because I think we're still waiting on them to get rid of those two.

[Speaker 1]
Brian is no longer here. And the other one is also no longer here, and whoever the other character was.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I was doing something.

[Speaker 2]
If I have to dip during mid-session for reasons no hard feelings are at.

[Speaker 1]
I, come on now. If they're for reasons that you explained earlier, then yes, there will be hard feelings.

[Speaker 2]
There will or there won't? There will.

[Speaker 1]
Your girlfriend can wait.

[Speaker 2]
There's context.

[Speaker 1]
No there isn't. You're in a long-term relationship. You're in a long-distance relationship.

There's no context.

[Speaker 2]
There is plenty.

[Speaker 1]
There's no context that matters.

[Speaker 2]
There is plenty of context.

[Speaker 1]
Press fill there. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
It's a certain someone you know. Yes. Wait, you already figured that out?

Holy.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I mean, it's Bunny, right? Yeah. Yeah.

We, uh, patch things up.

[Speaker 1]
That's fantastic. You're like, how many hundreds of miles away from each other?

[Speaker 2]
Um, not that far, actually.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Well, hold on, what does that mean? Like, driving distance?

[Speaker 2]
Plane distance.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Are you keeping one in your backyard? Is that what's going on?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm a professional fucking pilot, bro.

[Speaker 1]
Uh-uh.

[Speaker 2]
But nah, she's, uh, flying somewhere today, so.

[Speaker 1]
Like, even less of an excuse. Which is, of course, to say no.

[Speaker 2]
I'll be like, uh, sorry babe, D&D's more important.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, unironically, yes. That's, that's, that's the idea. It's not D&D specifically, it could be playing video games, it could be fishing, basically anything.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it's kind of my own incompetence that led us here, because, uh, she said she was flying somewhere. She said she was flying somewhere, so I figured that, oh, she's flying at night, you know? So, like, I'll have time for the D&D session that we hang out after, yadda yadda yadda.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's still the case. You just gotta wait until the flight ends.

[Speaker 2]
You're a genius. Is it just gonna be us three?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, it shouldn't be, right? Chizza said he would be down for it. I don't really mind either way, you guys can just kind of dick around for a little while on the lower levels and pick up some extra goodies.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll pick up, like, a jewel or two. Like, ooh, gemstones!

[Speaker 1]
I need to do a flight map. Okay, this is five, there's a level six there, so I'm gonna name that one.

[Speaker 5]
Image.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Varanat, still waiting on you to get inside the foundry, my dude. How did you know? Because I could see everybody who was on the foundry.

[Speaker 4]
I meant about the YouTube part. Wait, what? Wait, did you just say get off YouTube, get on the foundry?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I said get on the foundry.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. The explanation for why you weren't on the foundry didn't matter as much to me. I should just export this.

[Speaker 2]
Something's clinically wrong with me. I have almost a hundred hours played in the last two weeks of The Long Dark. Something ain't right.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's just any time you play a new game.

[Speaker 2]
No, because, like, I played it for a while before, but I guess I had, like, a resurgence or something.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I joined the foundry.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect, you boys are gonna start at the... Also, spoiler, Varanat, because I think right now you're locked in as Silmasil. Silmasil is turning tomorrow.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'm in. I'm gonna go with Fire Spawn. Okay, I'm going to the field of work.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, that's Fog of War, which I don't want there.

[Speaker 4]
Wake me up inside.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, fuck it, it will activate. Okay, where do I place my token? Go ahead and place it right at the bottom.

Just look for my cursor here. Just look for the big dot. Do I just drag the picture over?

[Speaker 6]
Yep, you just drag and drop it.

[Speaker 5]
Are my... Let me get a long rest so I get my skills back. And who was Felix?

Was Felix from Nameless? I think it was Nameless.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Varanat, still waiting on you to place your character here.

[Speaker 5]
What? Oh, it's a dark map for me.

[Speaker 1]
Are you awake for the session?

[Speaker 5]
Yep, not awake. But I will... Where to place it?

Right where my thing is here. I just see box screen. Okay, there.

[Speaker 4]
One second.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
But... Just so you know, I will have to mostly type.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Because I have to be quiet. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. So, you guys are at the top of the elevator here. So, I'm at the top of the elevator.

You're on an island, very small island, that has a sort of a cracked hillside exposing some dwarven stonework within. One of the other characters has been here at least, at least like three times. It's Akira out in front of this padded wall of rock.

Don't Blame Daiko has shown up here. And then we have a new character as well, so go ahead and introduce yourselves.

[Speaker 3]
Do you want it like in-character?

[Speaker 1]
Or just like tell you what I am? Whichever you feel like.

[Speaker 3]
So... This is Krylus. He's a primordial ooze plasmoid.

He is a ward of nature druid, circle of the moon. He has like a... Like the sun symbol.

Like the rune for the sun as a face, if that makes sense. Like he doesn't have like a real face. Like he has no eyes or like mouth or anything.

Although he does have like the receptors for it. So you can't tell like his facial expression or anything. He's like...

He looks like a ghost. Like a Slimer from Ghostbusters. Is like the best way to explain it.

I can put a picture in the OOC chat.

[Speaker 2]
Should I go next?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm Zekir. I just use a bow and deal a fuckton of damage.

[Speaker 1]
Well with that it is up to you folks to decide when you'd like to enter.

[Speaker 2]
Stealthy position. Same with rock. I mean I can do the stealth.

I mean I got some... Oh my god what are these fucking rolls bro. Anyways I'll be staying in the back.

You all can... Do what you're best at.

[Speaker 4]
What even is our mission? Or purpose here?

[Speaker 1]
Dungeon crawling, getting some loot.

[Speaker 6]
Ah ok. Yeah just...

[Speaker 4]
Ok so... I'm gonna move closer to the entrance. I guess.

I'm gonna open the door.

[Speaker 6]
Because why not. Ah. Ok.

[Speaker 4]
Um... I saved the tethers. I don't really see anything at the entrance.

[Speaker 1]
You can see actually two machines. One on either side. One on either kind of like far...

Far side of this chain of rooms. There's a set of tools nearby. It appears to just kind of be like powered down, shut down.

Occasionally you see little sparks or puffs of smoke come out from them. But it doesn't look like... They have various panels open.

[Speaker 3]
He said the machinery was... Where exactly on the map? I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Was by these two machines. So the clockwork defender over there. And then the uh...

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Qylus is like... He doesn't know these people.

Uh... He's like peeling out the room. Uh...

Can I like describe what y'all look like? Uh... He's just like complete strangers to him.

Uh... He's like... He's not one to like...

Question. He just like... Goes with the flow.

If that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
I think Daigo is not really in a position to uh... Daigo did ask... If y'all should...

Check the uh... Check the things or just continue on.

[Speaker 6]
Hmm...

[Speaker 2]
I say... We investigate. What about you?

Other person.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... I assume we should probably...

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Investigate the machinery. Um...

I've never been here before. I'm not exactly sure. Uh...

[Speaker 2]
How this works. So there's upper levels. Which we are on right now.

Then there's the lower levels. Um... Might be a little dangerous with just three of us.

We could try but... Death isn't exactly attractive.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. So we must ascend?

[Speaker 3]
Is that the goal? Um... But first...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we can descend for more loot. But it's more danger too. In general.

That's how it works.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So we shall investigate the machinery. Rock and Secure will creep up to them.

[Speaker 5]
Um...

[Speaker 3]
As I said... Uh... Qylus is a nature ooze.

He's not exactly the best with machinery. Um... He probably wouldn't know much about this.

But uh... He likes... Uh...

How do you say like...

[Speaker 6]
He likes...

[Speaker 3]
F-ing with machinery.

[Speaker 5]
Like uh... He doesn't know how to like... He doesn't know how this works.

I was just saying...

[Speaker 4]
My character won't know much either.

[Speaker 2]
James... What would I roll to investigate this machine?

[Speaker 1]
Probably you could do Arcana, Nature...

[Speaker 2]
I will do... Nature... So...

What can I figure out with this 7?

[Speaker 1]
Made of some funky minerals. But you don't know what those are.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... I look to... I look to Rock.

Um... Maybe uh... Maybe Rock's taste buds will tell me something.

[Speaker 1]
Rock shakes his head.

[Speaker 2]
Um... So you said it's like deactivated, right? Or like it doesn't look to be...

Okay. I'm going to attempt to talk to it. I'm just gonna like say hey...

Hello... See if it responds to... Any commands.

[Speaker 1]
What language do you speak to it in?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Let's just try common. Abyssal?

Draconic? Dwarvish? Yeah, I know a lot of languages.

[Speaker 1]
You get a brief response.

[Speaker 2]
A brief response of...

[Speaker 1]
Power low.

[Speaker 2]
Power low.

[Speaker 5]
I can talk.

[Speaker 2]
Um...

[Speaker 4]
Maybe I can try to charge it with some energy? I guess.

[Speaker 2]
I said maybe I can try.

[Speaker 6]
But no.

[Speaker 2]
The machine's over here, by the way.

[Speaker 5]
The other side.

[Speaker 4]
Um... What do I even know for that?

[Speaker 1]
Shoot. This would probably be something like an organa check in this case.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
Of course if you have a suggestion for what you... As a proficiency. Or if you have any secondary class types that are applicable.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Not sure if survival is applicable. It...

Hmm... I mean... I can...

Try... Some radiant energy? I don't want to attack it.

Um... Maybe I can... Combine...

The... Perception with Arcana? Not to blow myself up.

With survival?

[Speaker 1]
Probably, probably not. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Now that I'm at the machinery. Um...

Can I... Cryos is not how this shit works. So he would like...

Stick his like oozy little fingers in it. And like try to... Like...

He can go through something that's like... Uh... Spaces that are like an inch wide.

[Speaker 1]
Right. So, unfortunately this guy's... Uh...

Pumping some energy into it right now. We'll get to that in a moment. Uh...

Daiko... You could feel... It's definitely...

Go ahead and expend a key point here. It definitely starts... You do succeed in feeding it some energy.

But now it's... Kind of feels like your hand's just glued to this thing. And it's trying to draw more.

[Speaker 2]
It feels like your hand's glued to it.

[Speaker 1]
I know that you want to stop. But right now it's not stopping.

[Speaker 4]
Can I... Try to control my chi to... Suck it back?

If that makes sense?

[Speaker 1]
You're happy to try whatever you'd like. What do you do?

[Speaker 6]
Um... I'm... Thinking...

[Speaker 4]
I can... Probably... Try to hit it.

But... Is that the best idea? But...

Is it like a charm... Did you try to do what? Uh...

So... Is it like a charm thing?

[Speaker 6]
But...

[Speaker 1]
Once more I need... I can't... Man, I cannot...

I barely understand your accent when you're... Speaking at a humble volume. Let's just type it out for a sec.

Is it the charm effect? No. Go ahead and make me a strength saving throw.

Alright, and then... While he's doing that... Krillis!

What are you doing?

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Krillis...

[Speaker 3]
Is uh... Like I said... He's trying to go through the cracks...

Uh... Of this like... Machine console...

I guess. Uh... And like...

Check out like the interworkings... And like how this thing works.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and make me... An investigation... Or arcana check...

Or some other check that you think... Is applicable to this. Alright, you see some crossed wires...

And some... Uh... Basically a bunch of...

Interior damage. Let's see here... You don't see strength check in attributes...

Man, it's a strength saving throw. So... What you're gonna do...

Is you're gonna click on the thing that says strength... Like just click directly on strength... And then that menu will come up.

Uh, but Krillis... There you go, you managed to pull yourself free. Krillis, you can see a...

Shard of what looks like... Like a mix of kelp and coral... That's just kind of embedded itself...

Between the uh... Between the power station... And the...

Secondary power station. Yes, you lost one key.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So... I'm sorry, is it like... You said it was containing kelp?

Like... Is it...

[Speaker 1]
Yep, it's like a... It's pretty clearly like a foreign object. There's some lacerations near the...

Wires and some damage... Some chipping to the... Interior power stations...

Or power supply you could say... These uh... Big obsidian orbs...

In the middle... And there's a uh... And yes, there's this mixture of like kelp and coral...

That just kind of looks like a... Like a virus... Or growing like a mold...

Over... Between these two power stations.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So... Would I be able to discern that that's...

Interfering with this... Uh...

[Speaker 1]
Mechanism? Well, that's up to Prylus. Okay, um...

The main thing that matters is what he's going to do with it.

[Speaker 3]
Huh... Um... Can I...

Can I like try to remove... Something? Like uh...

The 14 wasn't good enough so... Can I roll... Kena?

Or... Or can I just try to remove something? No, actually I'm going to try to remove the kelp if possible.

Um... Okay. And see what happens after that.

Oh shit, that's what that is.

[Speaker 4]
Um... It was... I still was 20 points...

Right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I clarified that earlier.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Can I... Try to play the piano?

To see if that's going to happen.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So... What is that? Maker's Prestige?

Is that what you want me to use? I don't...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, are you still looking for something to roll?

[Speaker 3]
You told me to use one of the secondary class dice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can use those. Right, so the... The secondary class dice are just something that you can roll to add to a...

A given check. Uh, sometimes you can add it or... Diminish it from damage.

When it comes to crafters, they have stuff that relates to constructs, siege equipment... Structures... And obviously crafting.

As some suggested uses. My recommendation is... Roll first and then you can kind of like tally...

Potentially relevant modifiers later. Because right now you guys are about to... Go for another...

Random encounter roll at this rate.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, you got a 7.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
These are some great rolls we're getting today. Yeah. So what's...

[Speaker 3]
What's my... Die for this? I don't see it.

[Speaker 1]
Your dice are equal to your... All secondary class dice are equal to your hit dice. So if you're an 8th level...

Okay, so I...

[Speaker 3]
So I got a d8 or a d10.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Is that what you're saying?

[Speaker 1]
It looks like you have... 5d10 that you could use. And...

Or... 3d10. Or sorry, 5d8 that you could use and or...

[Speaker 2]
And I'd like to clarify, the... Construct still isn't doing anything right. It's...

Kinda just... Alright. I say we all make our way deeper.

[Speaker 1]
17 would be a success. It kind of... Starts for a moment.

It's still in a... It's still in a low power state. But it looks like...

Basically the lights that are on this thing... Begin glowing again.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. He like... I imagined he was like...

Extending his head like... Into the thing and like looking that way. So he'll like...

Flirt back out of the machine. And he'll be like...

[Speaker 2]
I still think it's doing nothing. So I think we should get a move on. Now if I remember the way to the depths...

Which I don't think I do. I think... Actually I think we go up here.

I'm trying to remember my way.

[Speaker 6]
So...

[Speaker 1]
Up is up a level? Or it's the same door? Or not the same door.

There's a... There's a door on the down level. And a door on the up level.

[Speaker 2]
Oh the... Oh the down level. The up level.

I want to go down.

[Speaker 5]
I want to get back to where... The group was last time.

[Speaker 2]
We are going to teleport there right?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to try.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Prepare for magic. Alright.

That's the sound of... A ha ha. Alright.

So... Secure and Rock I'm assuming are still in their stealth state. So we're going to...

[Speaker 1]
Wait no no no. Don't go anywhere.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
There's a critter in this room.

[Speaker 2]
There's a what?

[Speaker 1]
There's a critter in this room.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh. Creepy. Creepy crawlies.

[Speaker 1]
Huh.

[Speaker 4]
Friends?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think these are going to be friends.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
This is going to be really interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Oh god this is close quarters. This is not my specialty if we get fucking... Okay.

Oh. Great. Cause I'm going to need it.

Ha ha. Oh. How generous.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not the slightest.

[Speaker 1]
What's that mean? It means I'm not being generous. Ha ha.

[Speaker 2]
Alright so while he's doing this. What are y'all good at? I know our monks probably got punching things.

What uh... What slime do you get at?

[Speaker 6]
Uh...

[Speaker 3]
Like... Mid range I guess is the best way to describe it.

[Speaker 2]
Are you a mage or something?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I'm a summoner. And uh... Fighter.

I can do frontline and uh... Summon a bunch of guys. And I can do like...

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Long range as well. What the fuck are those?

[Speaker 5]
Not friends.

[Speaker 1]
Alright go ahead and take yourselves... Go ahead and take like a ten minute break here. I'm going to pause the...

And add yourselves to the initiative tracker. You can do that by right clicking on your character token. And clicking toggle combat state.

[Speaker 2]
Why did I just roll it twice with one press? Oh this is cool. I'll take the first roll because 22 is great.

I've never used this thing before. I didn't know you just had all this stuff.

[Speaker 3]
Like uh...

[Speaker 5]
I prefer Owlbear. Owlbear is not this automated.

[Speaker 2]
Alright break time I'll be right back.

[Speaker 6]
Oh come on. Come on. Come on.

I've returned.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. So how would you zoom in if you're on... Uh...

[Speaker 5]
Touchpad. There you are now. Alright I'm back.

[Speaker 4]
Welcome back. Wait. Did you ask me something?

[Speaker 6]
Did I? No.

[Speaker 4]
No not you.

[Speaker 1]
Alright these things very clearly look pissed off. They kind of flare up and well up I should say. These two water elementals.

The top of the round is Kira.

[Speaker 2]
There's only two of them. Right? From what I can see.

[Speaker 1]
Do you see anything else in there?

[Speaker 2]
If I squint really hard I might find pixels. That's it though.

[Speaker 1]
What do you want to do?

[Speaker 2]
You know the drill. Zephyr strike.

[Speaker 5]
Then we go... Use precision attack.

[Speaker 2]
My attack didn't roll.

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. There we go. Targeting.

[Speaker 1]
Press T when you're targeting Kira. There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Hit? Or miss?

[Speaker 1]
Literally just misses.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to use action surge so I can do this again.

[Speaker 5]
That hits. Absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately no damage bonus. So it's just 12 piercing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright is your bow magical?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. And to make things a little spicier I'm going to use... Blessing of the Raven Queen as my bonus action.

I'm going to teleport right up here. And then I'm going to send Rock up here and use his free action to bite... Try to bite the same target.

[Speaker 1]
You can just... Remember if it's a companion you can just deal damage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
So this guy's turn is up. He's going to drink a potion of speed.

[Speaker 5]
What does that do? It makes him feisty. Oh.

Fun.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah your guys are going to have fun.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to use freezing strikes. There we go. He's got 10 points.

And the free attack from the ace. What was that? Two hits?

[Speaker 2]
Uh yeah. Who's he smacking?

[Speaker 1]
He's smacking you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Half. Half.

[Speaker 1]
And then here's the cold damage. A grand total of 5 cold damage.

[Speaker 2]
5... 19... 24.

I take 12 damage.

[Speaker 1]
That's right because you take... It's resistant to all damage for Blessing of the Raven Queen.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah it's actually pretty fucking good isn't it?

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The next one's going to go. It has a wand in it's right hand. It's composed of...

Help and Bone. Go ahead and make me a Wisdom saving throw.

[Speaker 5]
Me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes you.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And you are paralyzed. And there will be effects of Hold Person.

[Speaker 5]
Oh perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Brings us to Daiko. This is a magical attack. So that's one hit.

Still got your extra attack and a bonus action. That's pretty good.

[Speaker 6]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
16 misses. And anything with a bonus action.

[Speaker 2]
Schmeck.

[Speaker 1]
He 28 hits. The other one does not. Magical poison damage.

Alright good hits. At the end of your turn. And then cry unless you are around.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm going to... First of all...

Bonus action. Manifest that grave. I have to go to my...

Features now. And do the... Do I just click the option?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And then just pop it from chat?

[Speaker 1]
This is something you want to do in between turns. Don't be afraid of putting something on the map if you're around. If it's not your turn yet.

Because it makes stuff like this go by way faster. So... Manifest Echo.

You would just click on that. Then I'm just going to copy your character token.

[Speaker 2]
Echo Knight is such a cool... Fucking subclass.

[Speaker 1]
It is pretty chill. Oh, that doesn't work.

[Speaker 2]
Yo, they fell in love with each other.

[Speaker 1]
Most people do for their minions. Just think of it as a new token. It's fine.

Alright, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
We're going to dispute the one... Right in front of me. Or straight in front of me.

With a crossbow. It's a magical crossbow.

[Speaker 6]
Am I not doing it?

[Speaker 1]
I can barely hear you right now.

[Speaker 5]
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1]
That's much better.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Did the text go through on your end? It's not coming up on my screen.

[Speaker 1]
So what did you click?

[Speaker 3]
The crossbow option.

[Speaker 5]
On my character sheet.

[Speaker 1]
What you have to do is click the little dice icon. On the character. So when you hover over it in inventory.

Go to the little icon. That'll show like a d20. And then you can click on that.

[Speaker 3]
Assuming that'll miss.

[Speaker 4]
Click on 2.

[Speaker 6]
Is that what?

[Speaker 3]
Unleash an incarnation.

[Speaker 2]
And do it again. It says melee attack. From the echo's position.

Oop, just kidding. Had the right idea though. I'm not sure if you can move your echo.

I mean I could just...

[Speaker 3]
Can I take that back? I'll just use a different weapon.

[Speaker 1]
For uh... Oh for the hand crossbow?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You can just have... Well you'll just have the echo roll an attack roll. With a weapon.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to figure out where I talked about your magic items. All right. Krilos, what's up?

What are you trying to do right now?

[Speaker 3]
We're gonna unleash incarnation. Hit him with moon sickle.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. And then just press T over the one that you're trying to attack. So hover over it and then press T.

Maybe click on it and press T. There you go. All right, then go ahead and roll your damage.

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, the same thing isn't coming up on my end. So it's like... I guess I just have to click it and then it does it.

[Speaker 1]
That's what I like. All right, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, there's EOT.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Zakira, you are no longer held.

[Speaker 2]
But I'm assuming that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Nope. It lost concentration. I forgot I had those guys up there.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
It lost concentration because it got hit by Daiko.

[Speaker 2]
Yo, let's go. All right. Considering my circumstances, I'm going to use another use of Blessing of the Raven Queen.

Get all the way back in this corner.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, now I know why you showed up twice. You had a second character token on this thing, which when I deleted... I'm just going to edit that.

All right, and then go ahead and keep doing your stuff.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Oh, well that's... sad.

[Speaker 1]
All right, go ahead and do another one.

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you still only have one attack, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that is... Today is not my lucky day, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
That's unfortunate. All right, is that the only turn?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm not sure. Rot can't attack because I didn't land an attack.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct. But he can hold his attack for somebody else who does.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll do that then.

[Speaker 1]
All right. He's the one who's going to attack... Krillus here.

[Speaker 3]
I should probably label them. How do I do that? You're attacking the one that's...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, it's attacking the Echo right now.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry about it for the moment. You just need to... What you really need to do is just create another actor and just call it Echo and place it there.

Yeah. He did not recharge. That's unfortunate.

But 20 is soon going to hit the Echo and dispel it. 16 AC, yes. All right, so we'll do that.

And then... Got Rot right next to him, so he's going to attack twice. Ah, fuck it.

We'll use the last attack on it. Yeah, there we go. All right, so we got 14 damage on Rot, which is not going to overcome his threshold.

And we'll keep him safe for the moment.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, so what do you mean by that?

[Speaker 1]
Basically, Rot has stamina for each fight as a companion.

[Speaker 2]
Right.

[Speaker 1]
And right now, let's see here. You're not level 10 yet, so right now his is 15.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And weapons, when that hits zero, does he die or does he fall unconscious?

[Speaker 1]
He gets incapacitated. Not unconscious, just incapacitated.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
He can't take actions. Really, he can't do stuff for you. If he gets knocked out, if that happens to him a second time, then he'll go unconscious.

[Speaker 2]
On a third, he dies.

[Speaker 1]
Not quite.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And for that, it's just kind of like normal unconscious rules.

[Speaker 6]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
And this guy is going to attack Daiko. Is he going to use... He has four charges left, but he's going to do some damage, or else he is screwed.

So... Freezing strikes. And then he's going to attack with...

He has one hand occupied, so this will be... 17... 13...

And then 13 again versus Daiko. None of which hit. It's wild.

How do you have such a high AC? It's handy. How high is his AC?

That's pretty good. It's 21. This guy has no shot.

All right. That's going to bring us to Daiko, and then to Krillis. 15 misses.

14 also misses. You've got a bonus action left. What are you doing?

And then, Krillis, you're on deck. Start thinking about your action. Or start rolling for action, man.

[Speaker 6]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
All right. This thing is looking pretty bad, or definitely below half. Worse than half.

[Speaker 2]
Krillis!

[Speaker 6]
Come on.

[Speaker 3]
So, Krillis is going to shoot his crossbow with complete precision, making the attack an advantage.

[Speaker 6]
Hopefully, it came up early. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
18 to hit on the guy in front of me again.

[Speaker 6]
Hold on. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
And then press T. You just gotta click him once, and then press T.

[Speaker 3]
Like I said, the T's not coming up for me, unless I'm doing something wrong. There's no... You're saying there's a T button?

No, press T on your keyboard. Oh, my keyboard? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry.

[Speaker 3]
No, you're fine. I completely misunderstood you. So, do I put T in chat, or just press T?

[Speaker 1]
No, you just click on him, and press... Click on him. The guy.

And then press T. There you go. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
It worked that time?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. And then, 18 hits, so... I'm just going to click this button for you.

Yep.

[Speaker 6]
I don't... I'm just going to roll it for you.

[Speaker 1]
What seems to be the issue?

[Speaker 3]
It's not coming up with a damage button for Precise Strike.

[Speaker 1]
That's odd. I can see one on my screen.

[Speaker 3]
It's like... I press the dice button, and then it comes up as Usability.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it should be...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so I had the... I already rolled it. It's...

You got 4 damage, and then 3 from the Precise... Precise Strike. Alrighty.

[Speaker 6]
Anything else you can show?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that was... That was the O2.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Zakira.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. I can't miss this time. I...

Who's calling me? Hell no. Sorry, someone was calling me.

I just had to mute it real quick. If I fucking miss this, I swear to God.

[Speaker 5]
Hey! It hits!

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
And then, Rock is going to go for...

[Speaker 5]
Schmeck!

[Speaker 2]
Uh... I don't think so.

[Speaker 5]
Parage.

[Speaker 1]
What? He's going to hold his action once he gets there.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to hold his action for the other guy to cast. Oh, person. Go ahead and make me a Wisdom Saving Throw.

Charging. That sucks.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, I need to make a Wisdom Saving Throw?

[Speaker 1]
You! That's pretty depressing there.

[Speaker 6]
Ha ha ha!

[Speaker 2]
This is not my day, bro!

[Speaker 1]
You gotta be fucking kidding me. And you have success! Alright, that's...

Oh, that's... Alright. Another one?

Yeah, there we go. Shit! Alright.

Versatile Damage. Critical Hit. Isn't that Versatile Damage?

Critical Hit? Grand total of 30 damage.

[Speaker 2]
I'm still kicking, boys!

[Speaker 1]
That guy's turn. And the other guy's turn bringing us to Daiko. And you're paralyzed, so it just comes out as...

[Speaker 5]
Hey, y'all.

[Speaker 2]
Doesn't help I'm fighting in close range, so I'm not really in a good situation here.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to try and help you after I deal with that one. But then it's so much trafficking. Okay, so how is he walking after I hit him twice?

[Speaker 1]
After the 11, That's after that. Oh, you did you got him twice? He is dead after the second strike That's the second time somebody knocked him down to one HP or one of these guys down to one HP.

[Speaker 4]
So now he is toast Okay, so I still have boom suction How is actually I am gonna move here He's dead Well, that was one hit point Well, let's take no way for you to not there's no way for you to not kill him if you hit oh Yeah, I just wasted a key point.

[Speaker 1]
Okay All right these things fade Let's see here. Well, I think some of their equipment stays behind. So their their tridents Stay behind.

They're just kind of Oversized mundane unwieldy mundane implements in your hands But yeah an empty potion bottle falls to the ground. It's plate armor which is obviously not designed for people falls to the ground and then a see here There's an empty potion bottle, but there's also a wand hmm, I Don't want the one but I want something else probably to sell Yeah, I think I'm the only spellcaster so can I look take a look at the wand?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, why not?

[Speaker 3]
Thanks. Oh wait, we have a ranger. I guess that's a half caster Right.

[Speaker 1]
So what would everybody like to do?

[Speaker 4]
I So there is a trident An armor and a spell wand, right?

[Speaker 1]
Each one of these have a trident. Yes, they have some armor Okay So How do you want to split the wood?

[Speaker 3]
I guess So Just try let's see this dude's wand can you pick it up? To like, you know those arm Those gummy hand slingshot things you had when you were a kid He does one of those and like whips his hand over and grabs the wand already Can I like making our candy track For What are you attempting to figure out? It's just like a mundane spellcasting purpose, uh I guess it's a wand so magical properties Alright, can I give myself guidance?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah All right. Okay guidance If you want when you roll the arcana check something you could do is you could just add a little menu there it'll let you add situational bonuses and plus 1d for Will apply the benefits of guidance.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, let me try that Check bonus do I just is that right?

[Speaker 3]
It's coming up with it's a wrong skill anyway Click go to arcana Situational bonus actually a bonus 1d for ooh, no fun.

[Speaker 2]
You've got you've got nothing Yep What about me Could I roll maybe investigation?

[Speaker 1]
investigation though very much in the realm of arcana because you have a specific Doesn't Seem like anybody has an objection by go can I hear a bit more about the armor? There's I mean there's Yeah, there was a potion actually, you know, it's There are two doses left in this potion So the armor is literally just some plating almost like a binding keep this thing inside of it

[Speaker 6]
The potion

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you said it was like a binding to keep sign inside of it I thought you meant like the potion oh

[Speaker 3]
Good cry list may be wearing if he was like if you like a just in case

[Speaker 1]
It's metal. So no, I Tell I could wear it Potion it is you dip your finger in And taste your tongue to it. You've definitely had a potion of speed before it's a potion that applies the effects of the haste spell increases your armor class by two Doubles your movement speed gives you an extra attack disengage or Dash action, I believe it is and it may just be one of them Getting right now Hmm applies the effects of a spell

[Speaker 2]
Where do you mind if I had the potion What's this face taiko

[Speaker 3]
Taiko so we see two doors on either side of us. Am I correct? That's correct Are they Like stone doors wooden doors metal doors These ones are made of waterlogged stone or waterlogged wood So Pilots is gonna waltz on over here if the gap is big enough in between the Door in the doorframe He would like to stick his slimy little head in or that bolt that sounded gross.

Never mind slimy head in or Whose head whatever I think this one is and pretty good for the next architecture being a dwarven citadel or formerly twerven citadel But probably doesn't have that inch of clearance you're looking for okay good that's what I was looking for I Guess good Does anyone have any objections to just opening the door? Just a random door Others do you have like a game plan?

[Speaker 2]
I was short resting. I must be quieter.

[Speaker 1]
So I was short resting Aiko and Nice just make a decision on it.

[Speaker 2]
I Mean, I want a short rest.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just say that.

[Speaker 2]
Hey guys, I want a short rest I'd also want the potion but I'm pretty sure Daiko has it right now and Okay, appreciate it All right, we're taking the short rest.

[Speaker 3]
Krylus will become a puddle on the ground with all of his armor and stuff just sitting in the puddle and taking out Question what button do I press for the rest or whatever?

[Speaker 1]
Does anything happen during the short rest Great question It's gonna have to happen Can't actually fit through there, all right Are you're like waiting on me or something So you see a Guess here what sounds like the something being raised To your right that sounds like it's some kind of mechanical worrying kind of similar to what you saw last time with the Are you here? Yeah, you hear some mechanical worrying similar to like when you were interacting with stone defender on the prior floor and It's not too long before you see some jiggling at the Door to your right and it's then that you notice that the door has actually been barred on your end

[Speaker 3]
okay, so a barred door on the right and then a Wooden door on the left

[Speaker 5]
That's correct

[Speaker 3]
Yes You know what we're just gonna open the left door is empty Like extend a hand back out into

[Speaker 6]
like

[Speaker 3]
Open the next door. Maybe not walk in yet, but like open the door also appears to be empty. Ah Yes another into I guess we fell into force a Last two more doors Rock and secure will close the doors behind them.

[Speaker 2]
This looks familiar All right, so last time I was here there's a secret door over here this wall is It still here so is the same switch and the Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Try to do all these modifications to the trap above it have also been Have don't appear to have been tampered with so If I went through I'd trigger it, right? I would trigger the trap modifications were him disarming it Oh Okay, I thought he set up a trap No, there was a trap above the door Now I said he just started he disarmed it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay So I know where the loot is it's over This way if I can get through the fucking door Just follow me guys. It's fine We're coming up on a place called the water room.

[Speaker 1]
There might be big baddie in it, but it's fine cuz There's a place we need to get to seems to be clear maybe See if there is a chest middle the room a chest it looks Mostly stone raw has a bunch of aquatic life draped over it.

[Speaker 2]
Is that one here proficient with thieves tools? Hello, is that one here proficient with thieves tools guys?

[Speaker 1]
The appropriate response to that is either a yes or no Not that way.

[Speaker 2]
I think no The problem No No, but do you have an idea? Okay. Okay.

What's your idea?

[Speaker 3]
Krylus is going to Extend his hand And shape it into a miscellaneous key shape And try to shove it into the lock of the chest You try to unlock it Honestly, that is pretty smart Good Can I make like a dexterity check or like a sleight of hand check for this?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may All right.

[Speaker 3]
Can I guidance it?

[Speaker 1]
Sure

[Speaker 6]
17

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he'll like As Sorry

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he'll like you'll see his Ghosty tail like swirl behind him as he like looms over to the chest You'll see him Extend his hand and it will in an instant the ooze will shape into a Stereotypical like cartoonish key shape And he'll just like wind up his hand and jamming block and you'll see like the You just hear like

[Speaker 2]
Well, that was unexpected Firstly secure is gonna close the door behind him and he's going to is the chest open Okay, it's still locked he sucked into the chest ah Well, we can't really open it oh I have a plan a Secure would like to check out the little well here the little pool is the well still there

[Speaker 1]
It is

[Speaker 2]
You said I had like a mini wish or whatever right or something

[Speaker 1]
You had a wish like like four weeks ago that you had to use within 24 hours and

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't know why but Okay, so here's my plan We're gonna push the chest down into the water because I remember at like the bottom There's like dry land or something.

[Speaker 1]
Okay secure puts his hands on the chest and Zakira disappeared The wolf seeking his master puts his nose up against the Disappears, all right. What are you doing? Mr. Let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
Mr. Baronet I mean Can I Pick truth door if it gives like a look or something What are you trying to do? What lost are you attempting to pick no, I mean to look past it like what Wait, you said I think you're saying That's That's perky stick Oh like peek through the lock.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah Okay. Oh sure. Go ahead and make me a perception share when I want you to you see two stone defenders on the other side getting ready to make a Getting ready to attack These the door For the room that you guys were resting in her one that's barred I Tell that to the party should we wait for them to go to the room?

[Speaker 4]
What's the president?

[Speaker 1]
Oh You are not with your party right now. I don't know if you missed it, but they disappeared.

[Speaker 4]
Oh Wait, did it is printable?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. All right. You weren't paying attention.

They Disappeared when they touched the chest Hey, I'm close to the chest I guess All right in the meantime Sakura and Wireless, what have you two been up to?

[Speaker 2]
Wireless is like a puddle on the ground right now You can place like the raindrops like splattering into the loops Yeah, what am I back to where I think I am I'm by like that Dwarven mission For boring and clearing tunnels.

[Speaker 1]
No, I see what you mean because your thing is still Yeah

[Speaker 2]
Beautiful Oh

[Speaker 3]
Didn't expect this at this point you'd hear some like gurgling coming from the puddle You can't really make out you probably couldn't make out what it says it's more of just like a sputtering noise and then like a Hand will reach out of the puddle and like slam onto the ground and then wireless will like lift his form out of the puddle and look around and his surroundings And make a perception check

[Speaker 1]
It is a rainy day inside you may not make a perception check unless you tell me what you're looking for but as far as your surroundings go you're inside a Mostly cobblestone flooring with a fair bit of moss grow between them and other plant life Almost looks like dried lilies.

It is a rainy day inside the dungeon Don't really just kind of seems to fall down from the ceiling.

[Speaker 2]
Ah All right Well, I'm assuming rock and secure Would need to make another stealth check to re-engage in sneaking. So I'm just going to Do that and seeing as we don't really know Where the hell we are. I suggest we take it slowly.

Um slime dude and Slappy fisty dude Into the both of them to uh, try their best to stay quiet Okay My map is still not changed.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
I'm aware Uh foundry just like takes me out the room for a second. So i'm trying to get back in uh, but You said we we feel a presence Or we see somebody No, I said I said psycho the fellow who Okay, the monk you were traveling with Has arrived at um Has arrived inside? Okay Uh greetings uh How was how was your trip I mean it was all right.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, the robots were trying to break into the first Where we fought the elementals for some reason Okay, uh dm I think you have to Put me back on the map or something.

[Speaker 3]
It's not coming back up like it was Oh wait, it's loading Let's see what happened But i'm, sorry continue All right.

[Speaker 2]
Could you would you two be okay trying to sneak with me? We don't know this place. We need to be sneaky I am gonna roll for stuff All right, yes sneaking We're safe for it to mess okay And what's his name?

[Speaker 3]
Slime dude sneak We don't know where we are If we sneak we can get the jump on people and we can get treasure Uh, my page is not responding if you could just roll for me, that'd be great your what's not responding Oh wait The sorry the page was not responding uh Give me unimento and I will have your stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Oh That gives you guys some time to decide where it is that you're going Um, I really like the idea of exploring the door on the left I I Just like the exploring part I guess Should we split should we should we split up?

[Speaker 4]
Um, i'm not entirely sure that's a good idea in a dungeon I mean maybe Not huge split up just like the two room next to each other for example Hold up.

[Speaker 2]
Could you repeat that?

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I might like you check that door and I check that door And then just Sure, yeah, we'll we'll do that.

[Speaker 2]
I just want to hurry up because We're kind of on a time moment here And judging by the fact that he's rolling 50 fucking dice, I kept getting the exact same result i'm gonna refresh Okay, let's No, I think not james.

[Speaker 3]
I think the dice are trying to say something Yeah, maybe Supposed to be black Is that is that thing?

[Speaker 6]
Yes. No

[Speaker 4]
What did you say

[Speaker 3]
My screen is black is that supposed is that like something you're doing or is my screen fucking up

[Speaker 1]
Oh your screen shouldn't be black if you could describe the a little bit more Like you just mean that you can't see your token

[Speaker 3]
Uh, like the map is black

[Speaker 1]
Map is black

[Speaker 3]
Um, I will just refresh Uh, but yes if you got my stealth roll, it was like 12

[Speaker 4]
We did

[Speaker 2]
Yes, let's just open the door but like be sneaking while you do it Or else we get blown up probably All right. Oh, it's already opened. All right.

I'm just gonna sneak ahead. I'm kind of gonna rush through this So far I see nothing so far.

[Speaker 3]
I see nine nothing Yeah, if we don't see anything just go on in Okay, i'm re-logged in there does not seem to be any problems thus far uh It is loading if you do find an issue just put it in chat.

[Speaker 1]
Don't narrate it All right. Uh, let's see here secure, uh your stealth log

[Speaker 2]
16

[Speaker 1]
presently not noticed

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's one of these motherfuckers

[Speaker 1]
They're glowing right now Okay, so you see some uh movement off in the shadows at the far end See a small Fire then a large fire get it

[Speaker 2]
knowing knowledge of these creatures I beckon rock to come towards me and I beckon the whole party to stand up We're going to openly approach

[Speaker 1]
Wait, you're gonna what?

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to openly approach because I caught a glimpse of at least two of the creatures Okay And I know From my previous encounters with these things I'm pinging Uh, if you have a dog with them, they're more docile they're less It's starting to do with like the prospect of death And that you're with a companion That can protect them more than they can or something like that.

[Speaker 1]
You're actually really not far off um Not far off at all

[Speaker 2]
And is a curious point this from memory of past experiences not from his own personal like Investigation or anything this is just because he's encountered these things before So I beckon the party to follow Openly approach I do see Uh, I think that looks like a troll but If it's just a troll we should be fine

[Speaker 1]
Crispy stoking the fire with a rather large quarterstaff Club can't quite tell from this distance and really if it's being held by a giant creature What's the difference between a club and a quarterstaff?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah Uh, can I try and recall the name of these things though Because I did forget their names. I just remember the sort of Would that be in our?

[Speaker 1]
Piss yeah, whatever check you feel is appropriate for our knowledge for these guys Here's some of your characters couple posts before oh It is i'm gonna spell it here because the spelling Is not phonetic Not the english at the very least Uh, it's pronounced q sheehee q sheehee Not letting me move my token forward Uh, have you clicked on your token?

[Speaker 3]
All right, and then what are you trying to do to your token you can you can speak Uh Trying to open the door not letting me uh Go through the door Uh tried to go to the other door won't let me go there.

[Speaker 6]
So what? Sorry, what are you?

[Speaker 1]
Stop What are you doing on screen right now when you're trying to move your character?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, i'm clicking and dragging Uh Into y'all's direction and it's not Allowing me.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Uh, what do you have clicked selected on the left side of the screen? Let's see token controls measurement controls tile controls stuff like that.

What do you have selected?

[Speaker 3]
I have all of that select token controls and select tokens.

[Speaker 4]
I have that selected Okay, I So I move closer to He won't say I also see that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no a second.

[Speaker 4]
We gotta get uh Okay, it's fixed here Okay, i'm gonna go to turret really quick Wait, you're gonna what Go to turret really quick I all right.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea what you said.

[Speaker 3]
Um, okay, let's go ahead and uh for cry let's go ahead and try now Uh, the door button is not responding, uh, it's allowing me to move my token though um So, yeah, so the door button's not responding Yeah, like it's not uh opening the door, um, and then whenever I try to move in y'all's direction Uh, it is not allowing me. There you go I know I was doing it right. It just was not working What just happened?

uh Did you not do that No, I didn't click anything.

[Speaker 1]
I mean I clicked the door. Okay, then it was lagging I don't don't really know what that was.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, carry on Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I think we're just gonna take a quick 10 minute break And we'll roll through this encounter if you guys want we'll probably finish off on this. Uh, we're just gonna take like a 15 minute break All right Gotcha So I am back. I Finally recovered from my headache Definitely gonna close down after this.

Is everybody back? Yeah All right So sakura you are approaching Yes, one of them has noticed you and is kind of whimpering uh, the Creature large giant at its side.

[Speaker 2]
It just kind of like shushes it Could I roll a Blood check would I roll to figure out what kind of creature it is?

[Speaker 1]
Probably something like a history or a cop. Oh, all right All right at 20 You've been learning a lot more about the phaeas of late. I spent some time with the dryads up by the hollow of lieu of claim and they told you a little bit about Creatures called for morians They're large giants that used to be fantastically beautiful when they were first and now they like to curse other people with a lot of uh, A lot of problems

[Speaker 2]
okay, so I kind of turn towards my party and I give them like, uh, I tell I tell them That uh, the big guy kind of bad But but the two the two wolf looking creatures, they're kind of good As long as you know don't actually attack them So I look towards the Q seath Qc he and I I kind of turn around towards rock and i'm going to use my animal tamer, uh feature to kind of beckon him to Bark towards the dogs And try and like communicate

[Speaker 1]
All right. So, uh rock understands he Barks towards the qc. He starts wagging his tail.

He's very uh alert Uh active not submissive, but happy and uh qc. He are Interested their their tails are lower, but they are wagging ever so slightly go ahead and make me an animal handling check Animal handling And I can use my I think my class feature, right?

[Speaker 2]
When it comes to things like animal handling, I forgot how this works Uh, because i've never used it before the voice of the menagerie You mean the dice? Yeah, the dice nice, it's just It's a 1d8 or something right, it's a Like for my my secondary class features, uh, I can expend my dice right my hit dice I don't entirely remember how this works You expend the dice not your hit dice.

[Speaker 1]
Just the the class dice Okay, the class dice and they are what d8s that is correct Well, you're uh, what's your hit dice? eight No, like what kind of oh a d10 Yeah, so they match your hit dice. I'm really getting unlucky here but i'm gonna close it off there so the um The qc he are excited at first, but then the femorian Stands up and it's really not looking happy.

Actually. I got a different token since mine is uh Apparently kind of fucked here you go Nice and the token stamp thing still works if I have room Stands up and looks over at the source of the barking and begins yelling in giant Do I know giant who I know?

[Speaker 2]
I do know giant.

[Speaker 1]
He's got a shovel who the fuck is in my home And i'm gonna add you to the fucking stew if you don't put the if you'll stop that yapping I I uh I comment back Trying to build a bit of rapport with the giant i'm like What kind of stew? Go ahead and make me a Suasion check I guess unless you have something else for this All right This is great What was that one d100? That was me rolling for a reaction.

Oh Oh Ah encounter reactions, here we go. It was going to be a 70 but I said 70 minus three so that's uh 70 Well, I was thinking of um I was gonna have my dogs go hunt for some meat actually Otherwise, all I got here is kelp Wait, those fine beasts with you are yours Uh, he yanks up a chain that was invisible beforehand And only really becomes visible once it enters the light like what did you think?

[Speaker 2]
I couldn't see the chain. So I had assumed, you know, uh, yeah. Yeah Anyways, you said uh, you were playing on saying them out for hunting.

Um, maybe we could make an arrangement I'm quite the skilled hunter myself Go on Me and my companions bring you back a fuck ton of whatever you want and in return we get a fuck ton of what we want Yeah, you're gonna have to be a little bit more specific than that treasure Now you want treasure.

[Speaker 1]
All right. All right. I'm sure I could uh conjure something up for you Just uh, what are you looking for?

Uh, yes, you are in your shadow this conversation used to be a used to be a swimming pool Go back through the door that you came through uh, go to the one that has the Two doors and a third opening with no door go through the one that has the No door And then look down at the window. You'll see a pool Usually there's a dolphin or something in there that I could Maybe a small whale But if nothing grab some uh, grab some fish I prefer mammals, but i'll take i'll take fish if there's nothing else there sounds like a plan and in my mind, um would be okay based on the arcana check I rolled earlier to tell if This creature is Um, are they trustworthy? What the fuck do you mean trust trustworthy?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, like are they likely to stab you in the back?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they're not good people Fomorians are generally evil I'll fucking will try a tendency towards a they have a tendency towards being selfish or being backstabby or uh their ideological goals or Typically, it's just like in pain selfish and angry about it A nod towards the giant and i'm like, all right, we'll go grab what you want We'll be back in a while All right. All right.

[Speaker 2]
Just remember your ward is going to be uh According to whatever it is that you give to me Sounds like a plan and I beckon uh, my companions to follow me Until we're out of hearing range of the the uh, the creature Is daiko here? All right So I'm good And make sure you close the door behind you What are we thinking? Kill him or don't kill him I really would prefer not to harm those dogs of his They're not bad animals in the slightest you'd be surprised what a good surprise attack can do uh, I suggest we just Do what he wants.

All right, shall we commence a round of fishing?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Um he said this way they tends to be a over here and if you go down there's a There's a there's a pool So james, what do we see in this room?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so that was a window over there through the window. You could see a large Probably what used to be a swimming pool, but the bottom has been paved in hollowed out And now goes way way deeper and you can see signs of aquatic life in there probably what uh the big guy wants Uh, you'll see uh Anyone here know how to use a fishing rod?

[Speaker 2]
I'm used to hunting deer. Uh, this is A little difficult for me, but uh, I bet I could try no All right, I guess I've never fished Uh Kylos wouldn't mind going for a swim there. I'd like to uh Make a survival check and just Give it a whirl.

[Speaker 1]
It sounds good my team Spirit what a critter that realistically shouldn't be inside this This shouldn't be it shouldn't be in a place like this at all but it looks like a freshwater Blue tuna Is it a big or a small fish Oh I turn towards the party.

[Speaker 2]
I'm like I like this idea. How do you suppose we Get the fish Well spearfishing is probably the best option for us.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you already shot it All right.

[Speaker 2]
I'm using a bow because you know I'm like communicating to my party members to uh creo creolus And daiko how they should fish Daiko might even be able to uh fish with his hands. All right, everyone.

[Speaker 1]
Let's get to fishing But you already you already shot one, how are you getting it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I shot it in the water I still haven't acquired it yet as opposed to where else would you have shot the tuna Okay Uh, I have a beautiful plan. I'm going to send rockin to go fetch it Okay I can protect him with my bow if something happens At least in my mind I can All right Uh So i'm gonna send them in uh, where would this pool be could you ping it?

[Speaker 1]
It's this entire room pretty much Okay, so I send rock in No Grab it take it back Nothing happens. Maybe he's a little bit mangled by his teeth. But besides that it's able to uh, Bring it back close enough that you could use some netting and ropes to Fish it up.

[Speaker 2]
All right, there's one.

[Speaker 3]
Um This might take a while uh, so is How how big are the ceilings in this room, uh in front of us? Uh, and you said it was like a pond or like a lake. Is that correct?

[Speaker 1]
This probably goes up about 20 feet All right.

[Speaker 3]
Um Uh, I don't have a token for this yet. But uh I'm gonna bring out uh Something out of the ooze You'll see like krylus Jam his hand into his stomach and it will like assimilate into the ooze and he'll pull something out of it uh Like a toy animal figure and he'll Uh raise up to his face And he'll recite an incantation And then throw it into the air, uh, he will summon, uh the bronze griffon uh, and then i'd like to take a person and uh Uh fish from the air

[Speaker 1]
Time to check his past Zakira has seen this creature before A hydra.

It's a hydra that has these green chronic scales on it Teeth and gills are Exuding this kind of poisonous gas

[Speaker 2]
You said it looks draconic

[Speaker 1]
Yes, it's the one that you saw last time

[Speaker 2]
Oh shit, I speak in draconic and i'm like hey buddy old pal

[Speaker 1]
All right, you're catching the attention of a uh creature with no sentience

[Speaker 2]
All right Go ahead and roll initiative Heh

[Speaker 1]
Why did you do that Uh, this is fine I swear and then Kryllis you can or kryllis you can be on the uh, griffon if you so desire for this

[Speaker 5]
All right.

[Speaker 3]
Um Did that work? Um Did my initiative come up correctly? Yep, there it is.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um So, yeah, i'll be on the griffon, yep, uh, can I All right, so I wherever you like I I communicate to the party and i'm like This creature dies if we destroy all its heads Friendly has nine. It has nine heads and I turn to the party. I'm like we can't fucking fight this I I genuinely don't think we can fight this.

[Speaker 1]
Um Well, there's all your discussion time, what would you like to do I say we run You're just gonna get out. Uh, kryllis hasn't Changed position at all So i'm just gonna assume that the griffon is in the room with him

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I don't have a token and I don't know how to do an altitude change

[Speaker 1]
well, that's that's not really the issue because I assumed that you were flying around inside the room at first, but He didn't move them So that will be the I mean the hydras is going to get a breath weapon off It's the folks in the room So I need daiko and kryllis make saves You take no damage nice Where'd you get that from? Nope That's not what that does That's for dexterity saving throws Oh, well Uh, i'm resistant to poison so I will still take half No, it was a constitution statement throw Very cool.

It says constitution saving thrown. All right, so that's 35 damage. Uh, that's half to 17 One thing that you could do is if you click on your character token and then right click the damage in chat You get a nice little menu And tells you hey you can heal you can do half damage very handy and then I'll just clean it and combat here because you guys will be able to escape and it will not be able to follow

[Speaker 3]
um kryllis will like uh join everyone and like Uh wipe some fake sweat off his brow. You just see like some ooze flowing across the room uh, he'll say like uh Ah the apex predator nature at its finest

[Speaker 2]
So that could have gone better Um, I don't think he's gonna be satisfied with a large tuna, but but but but If worse comes to worse We kill him Because we can probably take him but we're definitely not gonna be able to take the hydra so yeah Uh, but before that, let's go explore This room, uh, does anyone have something to heal with uh I Don't let's see

[Speaker 3]
None of you have healing spells

[Speaker 2]
I guess we I just have to keep moving then Good shit.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, actually both beat me here.

[Speaker 2]
Um, okay Yeah, we are Yeah, we decide to um Do something.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I decide to do something completely interested I'm gonna cast healing word on myself I think we'll figure that out in just a moment daiko check something All right, so this section, uh actually does lead you into some water So water, uh dodged earlier using what yeah when you say earlier though Everyone have helped you against the hydra Yeah, it just gives you an advantage. Uh, it just gives enemies disadvantage on attack rolls against you Yeah, so this section has a bunch of uh water just kind of like a few spots that are dry Is the water deep? It gets deeper as time goes on but there's kind of like a side path that you can see around the corner As the water gets deeper there's a raised section that you can hey, what are we down to uh walk on it Like are you guys okay with it?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yeah, I don't see a problem all right, but and I'm assuming I see water as far as the eye can see except for this path, right?

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea what that's supposed to mean Like just all around You around the bend there is a section that gets deeper the path continues on on the left side, but there's a section of the Room that has a very slowly turning whirlpool in it like by slowly. I mean like moving Unnaturally unnaturally slow.

[Speaker 2]
Hold up. What's a whirlpool again?

[Speaker 3]
It's like a little I I just looked this up It's a tornado but in water Oh that looks scary This one's like turning really fucking slowly like slower than like the waves lapping around I could just carry Uh myself and one other person over but that would leave one of you out, uh to figure it out Why don't you fish up here? Oh Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Well I thought we had to get past the whirlpool to go fishing Let's see what we can get from the whirlpool And how are you guys gonna go fishing? um Should we go back?

[Speaker 2]
Wait, where is varna here?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he's the one who's playing deco Oh, I meant like the character because Barnard is a player daiko is the character is the character.

[Speaker 2]
Um, should we go back?

[Speaker 5]
I'm interested to see where this goes um can I Can I walk up to?

[Speaker 3]
the whirlpool uh Can I get? I have to be within like a foot of it. Uh to use this.

[Speaker 1]
I just want everybody Tell me how it is that they're going to be doing this or or not at all Just briefly.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Uh, I typed it for me Right you typed it and then I'm going to help Uh, i'm going to help daiko fish Like i'm going to use the help action like maybe assist uh by pointing out where I see fish or Just trying to spot in general Right and then chrylus, how are you doing this?

[Speaker 3]
Hey, can I just Like be 10 feet away extend my head over uh and use my uh eyes of my newt scene to uh See if there's any fish I mean every time it lets me make them No, but like where they are or like a specific location or if one's swimming by and I can grab it something like that I um I mean, is that is that a thing that you could do just kind of like stretch? Okay, I can um Let me just i'll put it in chat. You can read it That's ambient It's a very uh, sort of pseudopod that's up to six inches wide and 10 foot long or reabsorb it into your body I was not specifically saying that one but uh in tandem with the amorphous, uh Traits, uh, I would think I could possibly do so, uh, but up to your discretion Uh, I don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
So amorphous is like while you're not wearing or carrying anything Yeah, if i'm if i'm squeezing through a crack that's an inch wide.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I have to be Uh, I have to take my equipment off right? But all I want to do is extend my head

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't I mean, it seems like you could do the pseudopod thing To grab it, which would be basically the same because again you You know that there are fish in here I guess if you're um close enough you could grab them You just have to be next to the thing in order in order to see it

[Speaker 3]
Or to use the eyes of night, all right, i'll just wait for everyone else and see what they do

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead and make me a survival check With advantage with advantage Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
All right 14 Baiko goes for a fish pretty good cast right by the center of this little whirlpool here. He watches the Bit of rope and knife And bread start trundling towards the center And zekira you're kind of threatening like no no pull in pull in pull in and then you look over and it Looks like um baiko looks weird baiko looks blurry and a little bit stretched Stretched. Yep.

He's just kind of like his image is just kind of like stretching towards the whirlpool um Would it be possible for me to like?

[Speaker 2]
Realize this and try and get him the fuck away I have no idea what that sentence means.

[Speaker 1]
Would you like to do something?

[Speaker 2]
Like try and pull them away from the whirlpool because it's like towards the whirlpool.

[Speaker 1]
So like opposite All right, so you're trying to pull them away. That's there you go. I can work with that um It's your hand basically you go to like grab them and your hand just kind of like passes through them Looking at like a light after image of daiko Can I look?

[Speaker 2]
Towards myself like look down see if anything's happening to me like look at my arms And kind of get sucked in uh, nothing appears to be happening to you.

[Speaker 1]
No He's just gone Did that yank everybody over?

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I Said did that yank did anybody notice the Um that the map changed for everybody Yeah, it changed for me. All right, just let me know if that happens that wasn't supposed to happen. All right and then Carlos what do you think could have happened?

[Speaker 3]
Um, well whirlpools are Part of nature, they're one of nature's marvels Uh ever so unpredictable and also ever-changing uh And numerous things could have happened. He could have drowned he could have Suffocated he could have Uh, he could have imploded. He could have lots of things could have happened.

Uh you you You flesh beings are so fragile So what you're saying is don't go after him got it uh Well, I don't know him very well.

[Speaker 2]
So Uh in survival of the fittest so praless is not very inclined to but uh, I will do as uh, you wish I Can sort of look towards the whirlpool and I look behind and I look towards the other side of the whirlpool I uh, do I do I see anything on the other side of the whirlpool like? over here I don't see anything. Um Nonetheless, I want to press on I want to use blessing of the raven queen to teleport to the other side And do some scouting I sort of shout across the whirlpool.

I'm sure if he can hear me I tell him to you know I'm just lying.

[Speaker 3]
I can just follow you Wait, you can Yeah, i'm on a griffon. I can just fly over it and that's like a giant whirlpool extinct to the sky or something Yo, that's sick.

[Speaker 2]
All right, but Uh, could my could have brought come along?

[Speaker 3]
Are you gonna get him? Yeah rock can come on.

[Speaker 1]
Okay uh Come here. Come here. Uh Rock yeah, I'm a sailor sure Where are the griffon?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, just on the griffon and leo over there We will never know what happened to daiko.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe we'll find him later.

[Speaker 1]
Your character has been deposited From the ceiling at the place at which you're currently at.

[Speaker 2]
All right cry less They say at the end of every secret lies bountiful booty Vichys Do you know what that means I sense treasure Treasure What so this is an empty world empty or deep oh shit do you guys have a proficiency with No, I have proficiency with jewelry stools.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it doesn't help All right, I think you guys need to think of an exit strategy here because i'm getting ready to wrap up the session Wait, you may not we may not have proficiency with thieves tools.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, cry list.

[Speaker 3]
Can you do that trick again with the uh, Like your your body to like open locks Oh you mean this and he like, uh Swirls his hand up in the air and it turns into the key again.

[Speaker 6]
Yes that right there.

[Speaker 1]
Yes That would be very very useful, what are you talking about right now?

[Speaker 2]
I just asked if somebody had thieves proficiency um, so Back back there before we got sucked into that that chest. Um That that trick he was doing with his hand.

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 2]
No i'm asking.

[Speaker 1]
Why are you why are you asking him to do that?

[Speaker 2]
Because you said signed about thieves tools. So I assumed signed do with right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I never I just I said that there's like Tools or does anybody I was asking if anybody I prefer to stay with these tools.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't say that there was a locked door in front of you Okay Well, we should probably try and get out then Yeah, let's let's go All right So we hop on the griffon Uh, you're gonna have to hop on and then i'll have to fly over and get the dog Yeah, we'll just do this to save time for time safe.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you guys do Uh trade places basically you have a person going and so forth, unfortunately there is Wait, is there a way to return again guys? I don't know why you ask questions like this. Um Can you can you?

It's a it's really easy to say. Hey, I want to do an arcana check To see if there's something match if there's a way I can like magically return to where the whirlpool was Right or hey, I want to do a I want to cast a spell. I want to have a control water scroll I want to see if I could cast that and see if that puts me back where the whirlpool was Or something like that.

But if they're like, hey, is there a Does my character have this knowledge that they do I have this knowledge that my character doesn't have or do I? can you tell me the secret way to do xyz's just kind of like I don't know It's it's late There is it looks like there's a little bit of a like there's a little bit of a magic whirlpool kind of at the bottom or at the at the north end of this Pond that you're looking at you guys can continue moving backwards I don't know if you're sure where your surroundings at the moment, but um It looks like you would need something to activate

[Speaker 2]
Hey kralis, let's give that big guy the tuna

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yep affirmative It's our bounty

[Speaker 1]
They're trying to investigate what you would need um Nope, that's that's where you come up with a resource that you have And say aha, I would like to plug this into this Anyways, all right, so you're bringing the tuna back

[Speaker 2]
yeah, and I try and approach enthusiastically like Hey, look what I got Oh, yeah, that's uh, probably not what you're used to eating every day, but I just gotta put up a bit of a struggle and I try and act like it's an accomplishment for someone to my size

[Speaker 1]
So yeah, so you go it plucks it throws it into the stew starts mashing it up with this large With this club slash quarterstaff mortar pestle, he's like, all right, not bad

[Speaker 2]
I Compromise cookie.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like smells good Because here there's a there's a secret passage behind this door Elevator should take you all the way up to the surface.

[Speaker 3]
It's actually on top of the hill and before you go So you're just kind of like rummaging around Um, so we took the dudist fish Uh Is that the last thing we had to do or besides, uh We still have to get out of here From what I said, there's a secret passage that gets us to the surface. We can use that Okay Uh, well, my token's not moving. So we'll just say I follow you Is your token selected?

Uh, yep, i'm not doing anything different than I have been it's just not doing it unless i'm like lagging but everything else is working so So you now right as I say something about it, no, that was that was me I just moved it Um, try selecting it make sure that it's like click.

[Speaker 1]
Yep I'm double clicking and then trying to double clicking on the token because your cursor looks like it's in a different spot on my screen You see it i'm like right in certain space like making squares I don't think so You might just be lagging because I just moved it. I just moved it twice So it might be a lag issue. Go ahead and refresh your uh, Your browser, but yeah, i'll have them Yeah, like everything else is loading but that Yeah, I don't know I don't have any details about what's going on over there Uh daikon, yes, the robot is shut down at the moment Let's see here.

The femorian is going to give you a little gold war mask With about 750 gold pieces Hey, is there you could uh, use that to get in touch with me if you Want to or you could just kind of sell it I've I sort of uh, look at it and I I and I equip it I don it That looks pretty good on you. Now, uh, get out of here. I gotta eat cast some spells All right, you two are returned via elevator to the surface It also appears that the passage goes Uh, this is actually technically a t passageway on the other end.

There's a There's the elevator, but it also goes further up And I can't really see much here All right So you guys are going to get returned to the surface. You're free to reconvene at the I don't quite yeah, if you just want to kind of like destroy it and Grab some stuff and uh, hope that's all that's still valuable at the end.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine All right What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
So frustrating I'll go navigation and then i'm just gonna deposit you There we go. All right, so you made it up got some xp from the mermadons and get a gold mask and then Currently daiko has a bunch of pieces from one of the uh Dead actually from the boulter outside or served from the from the boulter in the interior Hey, uh, you made it out Uh greetings friend same here we decided to hand the uh, giant dude piece of tuna and uh Here we are.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, that was a close call. Um Don't know if I'd come back to this place the hydras Just in a front against nacre

[Speaker 2]
zakira, you know Looking kind of exhausted from today's venture mainly, you know The fact that a bunch of weird shit happened like meeting an old friend Has exhausted him And he would like to return to town Okay, we're at town

[Speaker 1]
All right, you guys make it back to bronlock If you guys would like to take downtime actions there you're more than welcome to

[Speaker 3]
Can I look further into my wand? Is that can I isn't research a downtime action?

[Speaker 1]
Research is a downtime action. The wand is pretty simple. You just need to get that identified um after a little bit with it, you would see that it's a limited use, uh wand Of old person it has two charges left nice How would I How do you want Like do you just add that to my inventory or do I have to be there?

How would I add that to your inventory? That would be fantastic the way I recommend doing it is adding an item to in the items tab And then you could just edit it there and drag it straight onto your character sheet So create item Yep, uh, would you classify it as a equipment consumable or a tool?

[Speaker 3]
Or does that not matter equipment?

[Speaker 1]
It doesn't terribly matter if you're looking for a tutorial on Uh Oh found you there's a lot of youtube videos for how you might introduce that And then something I could do probably is I could I could probably use plutonium import Well, that's something you could probably do is go ahead and uh, right double click on your character Go to the three dots near the x at the top and click on plutonium import Instead of importing spells or something like that. You can import items import Two more millions and a little bit of extra xp for the um for that was quick thinking with this qc 5800 divided by three and oh and then I see other stuff. So that's Yeah All right.

Everything is in Yeah Session reports Easy potion of speed is it uh Is it wand of paralysis, is that the item? Yeah, I think you could use a wand of paralysis assuming that Does the thing that I mentioned if it just casts whole person then yes I think yeah, I think that's what I'll do uh Can you give me a give me a huge salad and just that's what it does Hold on. Let me let me go look at you should have the description for it right in front of you By pulling that little plus t one has seven charges while holding it You use an action to expend one of its charges to cause a thin blue ray something something paralyzed Yes

[Speaker 2]
Okay, got the potion of speed

[Speaker 1]
Uh, honestly, it's it's fine if you add that Um, you just have to edit it so that no longer says it has seven charges.

[Speaker 4]
It only has two And get rid of the thing about uh expending charges Um james Mm-hmm Um to identify the armor on the trident, is it a downtime action like research?

[Speaker 1]
I can you you type that in the chat? Which shot a downtime chat, how about that? All right, that's all I got for today Uh, if somebody would like additional xp I think you'd always write something up in session reports All right For three people that was not too bad Wait, you didn't die.

[Speaker 2]
Hey james Yep Honest question. Do you think we could have killed that hydra?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I don't I don't know Uh, you guys asked me a lot of questions that were like kind of kind of weird All the game it's it's one of these things like the the advanced the the people who are like 16th level in the server right now because they're just fucking killing it on the regular um You have a pretty specific pattern of like speech and and gaming where they go All right, we're going here. We're doing this going further. We're going we're going to do this Uh james, I would like to do x in the attempt to do x um, and then with a lot of new players and sometimes not the new players sometimes it's it's people who Just kind of get stuck in this pattern keep asking me Um, hey dm.

Do I know this? Or dm. Could you tell me if I know this?

Dm. Can I roll to see if you could tell me that I know this? Dm.

Can I roll to do a thing and that takes about like, uh, 10 times as long So killing the killing the hydra you guys did okay in the mermitting combat Um, in fact, I might even say we did good in the mermitting combat. It was just the rest of the dungeon crawl was just kind of um Really Really really fucking slow. I think you guys made like two skill checks in the first 40 minutes And at that point it's like all right, you're probably not going to get anything You're probably not going to get anything out of the value of this session You could have probably killed the Fomorian if you could have killed the fomorian you might have been able to kill that hydra You might have been able to kill the fomorian alone And the fact that you had the q she he kind of like not hostile to you was a good idea I wasn't expecting to roll good on that reaction check though

[Speaker 2]
Honestly, it kind of surprised me. We started talking to me like a normal human being. I was like, huh?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, these guys are not um I'm not gonna say they're not stupid. I'm just gonna say that they're they're like not Evil or gothic they're not animals But they're not good Fomorians are typically not good Seems to be a obsession with me keeping the bad things alive I mean It was speaking to you So it didn't do anything.

[Speaker 2]
But this time anyways, I should get going All right, it's been a good one y'all take care see y'all later peace

[Speaker 1]
So, so this copycat killer was either a very tall man, heavy tread, like quite a heavy tread, and probably heavy of build, or was maybe a Feravin, or a Goliath, or something of that sort. I think it wasn't a gnome. Usually entered from back alleyways, or from, uh, was, was a proficient locksmith, or lockpick, I should say.

In this particular, hmm, when I dealt with the murder, it was in rather a, a rather rich neighborhood, with a, with quite a large elven, it was part of the elven quarter, and he was supposed, I don't know all the exact details, but oh, the storm's starting. Jeez, okay. That was loud.

Oh, it was a gunshot at first. Oh, it's a siren. Okay, uh, so sorry folks, if I lose power, apologies in advance.

We did just get a severe thunderstorm warning.

[Speaker 2]
No worries. No worries, things like that happen.

[Speaker 1]
As he's like, all right, so I'm gonna send you folks off to the crying scene, so you can talk to my boss. He's, he's not happy about this, but the one thing of note, he'll be able to give you, like, more actual details, and you'll be able to see the place yourself, but the one thing of note is that every single time we found one of these bodies, it came with a note that said, uh, burn the body or this will happen again.

[Speaker 3]
And did you burn the body?

[Speaker 6]
No. Why not? Did it happen again?

[Speaker 1]
One of our, to my understanding, I wasn't on the force back then, but one of the aurors, one of the, one of the mages that was present at the time, said that it was part of a ritual that, like, burning the body would actually make something, would cause something substantially worse, either demon summoning or something from the outer realms would flood in if we actually did that.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, does this sound anyone familiar to my knowledge of anything I would know?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me either a religion or arcana check, please. What did we get? 14?

Uh, it's pretty common for demonic cults, especially, to trick people to, like, kind of try to trick societies into unleashing, um, in their attempts to stop the cult, accidentally start unleashing whatever the cult is trying to summon. Uh, that's pretty common modus operandi, but demonic cults prefer to, um, generally prefer, if they can manage, to just corrupt at, like, subvert, sway the rest of whatever their ruling political party is for that sake. However, uh, outsider cults, sometimes called nightmare cults or, uh, far realms cults, have a different modus operandi.

They are, they are quite happy to do stuff like this pretty much all the time.

[Speaker 2]
This doesn't sound like from the demonic cults I've heard of. It sounds like, like an outsider cult, almost.

[Speaker 1]
Like people who worship, uh, aberrations.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, as I would try and explain to the party.

[Speaker 1]
And as you see, we never burned them. There was a lot of panic. People were, people were quite upset.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
As we're, like, as we're walking through the scene, I'm just gonna, like, can I ask some questions? Yes. Uh, so, I know this is sort of obvious, but, uh, are there any jewelers, glassblowers in town?

[Speaker 1]
Jewelers and glassblowers? Yeah, yeah, there's, uh, there's at least one jewelry store.

[Speaker 3]
And, uh, were there any reports of stolen goods?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, none that have come in yet.

[Speaker 3]
That might be something.

[Speaker 1]
I'll ask. I'll ask them. I'll ask the local glassblower.

He's a alumni of a college. And I'll ask our biggest, uh, jewelry stores in town. After about an hour's walk, you folks come across the Elven Quarter.

It's not too long before you get to the, uh, this person's home was on the outskirt or border of the Elven Quarter. And there is something of a large crowd gathered down the street. They are chanting, uh, very, sort of, not really in unison.

There's a lot of people just chanting is probably the wrong word for it. They're mostly just yelling, uh, close to getting on the verge of a riot. Uh, shouting, burn it.

Burn the house. Burn the body. Give us the body.

We're not going to do this again. No more. Give us the body.

Burn the body. I join in. It's like, what, what are you doing?

Stop it.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to try and talk the crowd down and persuade them to calm down.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I will aid you.

[Speaker 3]
I'll, uh, I'll just look for agitators.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
How would you, how would you like to calm the crowd down? You don't have to speak in the first person, but just give me a, although you can, if you want to, uh, but give me a rough, a rough idea of how you're accomplishing this. Like, are you shouting at them?

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying to convince the people to let the police do their job and rel, you can, there's nothing that they can do to, that they're going to, if they're going to interfere, it might make things worse, type deal. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And Melania said you're, you said you're helping.

[Speaker 4]
And I, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. And I said you're helping. Okay.

That's going to make this from normally disadvantaged to a flat check. Perfect. You're a big guy.

People pay attention to you after sort of like forcing your way through the crowd. Uh, part of, probably half of it's your words and the other half is just, there's a bunch of people in strange gear with a whole bunch of magic that are, they're now approaching the building and they're kind of happy to let you folks do your work if for no other reason that they don't want to mess with you. Additionally, Mark is able to, various agitators who are riling up people even more like the one or two guys that are holding Molotovs, uh, and shaking them around furiously.

They don't like the sight of, uh, Mark or his underling with muskets. So they bounce. And once those guys bounce everybody, that's pretty much the last of the crowd.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna just keep an eye on the direction they went in.

[Speaker 1]
Looks like they went, uh, they go about a block west before they turn north.

[Speaker 3]
Like I'm not going to extensively follow them.

[Speaker 1]
Just, uh, you know, I'm just giving you a, uh, just giving you context for what I guess.

[Speaker 4]
And just to clarify, they've all dispersed then?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. After they disperse, Bellheart gives a sigh of relief that this didn't turn ugly. He versed civilians.

[Speaker 1]
Daryl is quite happy with your performance though. Well, uh, Who's sexy? Who's sexy?

I'm sexy. Who's sexy? Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
Is that the first, um, how do you say, protest that you've seen? Or has this been happening before?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I'm sure it would have happened, like I said, I'm sure it would have happened, um, back before I got in the force, but I haven't, I just, I just haven't seen it before. Me personally, like I...

[Speaker 4]
Is that right? Maybe they've been meeting in secret until now, and this was their moment to go public.

[Speaker 1]
Well, this is, remember that this is the first, this is the first body that we've had.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is the first public body.

[Speaker 1]
This is the first one in 10 years. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that there's probably a lot of anger under the surface that's been experienced.

We never found the guy prior. Folks have a right to be mad.

[Speaker 3]
Did you ever find what type of, uh, creature the regional killer was trying to summon?

[Speaker 1]
We had no idea. The Auror had, uh, suspicions, but they went missing on an expedition up north ages ago.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, who went missing?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the Auror. The, an Auror is a kind of like basically magical police officer.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
I see. Well, that sucks.

[Speaker 2]
We might want to get talking to your boss, though, if we're going to.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, was there, uh, boy, that was the first victim. Uh, I saw some, uh, of the agitators, the people that were holding harmful objects go off to the west. If you could, uh, send some patrols down that direction.

Thank you.

[Speaker 7]
All righty.

[Speaker 1]
So do we walk into the, yeah, they'll be sending you in in just a second. All right.

[Speaker 8]
Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. So the, uh, chief, uh, chief of the Constabulary greets you folks is introduces himself as Lord Griffin. It's another dwarf, rather bulky in stature and size.

He says, well, we best be bringing you in if you're gonna take on the bounty, but, hmm, well, I guess we don't have a crowd to worry about anymore. So come on in. Leads you up a staircase, takes you to an apartment on the third floor.

Here it is. Uh, two bedroom, one kitchen, one bathroom has a nice, uh, has a nice loft up here. Body is still up on the, body is still up on said loft and you'll notice the rather large window next to it.

The run in theory, please, please be careful. Uh, the run of theory, he said the killer snuck in through the, uh, through the bottom stairs. He snuck up to the fellow on the, onto the loft, uh, killed him there and then ran away.

There were some boot prints running away in the mud, but only like two of them.

[Speaker 3]
Are the prints still there?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. They're no, everything's still here. Body included.

Um, what would you folks like to, this, I'm going to put this in the chat as well. So there's the kitchen, bedroom one.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, well, first things first, uh, I'm going to ask the officer, um, the door, when you, when the person found it, was the door locked or unlocked?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. He checks his notes. Uh, we had to, well, and then he looks back up.

It's like, oh, we had to force the door open. We had to bust it down. As you can see behind you, points to it.

[Speaker 3]
So we're, we're not sure it's actually a lock pick. It's much easier if you're lock picking to just open and leave it open. Closing it would take way longer, but if you're using magic of some sort, then that's more understandable.

[Speaker 1]
Well, he could have re-locked it on his way out if he's smart enough to unlock it.

[Speaker 3]
That's like I said, more complicated.

[Speaker 1]
It's possible. It's pretty good if you're trying to cover your tracks.

[Speaker 3]
Is the key still in the house?

[Speaker 1]
We haven't begun rifling through his personal belongings. We've just been taking stock of the scene as we found it.

[Speaker 3]
I see. Okay, I'm gonna move to the body to know about the rest.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'll join in the loft. That's where they said the body is, right?

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you're going up to the loft?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm going to look at the body real quick and see if I see any signs of the ritual things on it.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. So you start going up to search the loft. Uh, the handrail here is a little bit rickety.

The stairs are squeaking like hell.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, how did someone sneak up these? You'd have to sleep like the dead to sneak up, have someone sneak up on you with this.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe the killer was wider.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll approach my companions and see which one looks the lightest.

[Speaker 3]
Probably me.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, as I get to the top, I ask you to try going up the stairs.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, can I roll an acrobatics to try and be really light?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I feel like this would go under stealth.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think I'll go under stealth as well. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty good. Uh, you go up. You make it probably, let's see, almost the entire way before it squeaks.

The second to last step up produces the loudest, uh, still produces a squeak.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, are there boot prints in the stairs? No. But there are boot prints in the first floor.

[Speaker 1]
No, uh, the constable, uh, constable looks at you and says, oh, uh, we found two boot prints. If you look at the, uh, body here, they're, the only reason we see them is because they're on the, uh, just because they're moving through the road.

[Speaker 2]
Then there should be a trail leading away, unless, hello? Isn't there some sort of a bell or something that allows casters to, uh, go from one spot to another? Uh, something step.

[Speaker 8]
There are quite a few.

[Speaker 6]
It has a racial trait. Something, oh, no. Warlocks with the fiend or fey, archfey.

Get it? First level.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but still, there, it sounds like someone just popped in there and then after shanking the guy, popped out. Let's look at this body. Any signs of markings on them for them?

[Speaker 1]
Markings from, of the ritual?

[Speaker 2]
Of some kind of ritual or something to indicate the presence of what they've been threatened with.

[Speaker 1]
So the, um, the only sign that was, you don't notice any demonic symbols or anything like that around. All you really notice from a cursory inspection of the body, what's obvious to you is that there's a bit of crystal that appears to be glowing out of where this man's heart is supposed to be.

[Speaker 2]
I have the feeling it's not going to, let me look at my, something real quick.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Uh, what direction is the body facing?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the body is facing away from the window towards the kitchen.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Uh, and is it like, is the, like, is the, the face, sorry, let me, let me think of how, is the blood going, like, staining the back or the front of the clothes? I'm basically trying to figure out if, uh, the body fell forwards or backwards.

[Speaker 1]
The body is on its back.

[Speaker 3]
But the wound is in the front.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 3]
That's weird.

[Speaker 2]
Should I try detecting magic on that crystal?

[Speaker 8]
Sure. Is that a bad idea?

[Speaker 1]
All right. Do you get a sense of conjuration magic coming off this crystal?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. That might be the, that might be the source of that threat. I have no idea how it conjures, but that crystal is a conjuration item.

It summons something. What? I don't know, but it summons something.

[Speaker 1]
All right. We'll leave you folks. All right.

What's, what's, what's his face? Uh, the Lord is just looking down and like, well, that's the body. Um.

[Speaker 2]
I report to the Lord Sheriff, uh, what I found out about the crystal.

[Speaker 1]
It's much the same as the Auror told me some 10 years ago.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm just wondering what we should do about the crystal though. If removing it would cause it to summon or burning it?

[Speaker 1]
We're, we're just not going to mess with it. We're going to be burying this thing once you folks, uh, finish up.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, would you like a gentle repose or something done?

[Speaker 1]
No, I do not want magic cast on his body. Oh, I appreciate it, but this will be a closed casket.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um.

[Speaker 2]
Let's look elsewhere for more clues.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Uh, James, do you mind looking at my stream just to confirm that I got the picture right?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know what railing front floor and.

[Speaker 3]
So front of the body, back of the body, the floor is.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to put this on a new scene so that you guys can draw it out. All right. All right.

Y'all should see murder notes.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, everything's dark.

[Speaker 1]
There should not be token vision on this. There we go. All right.

Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
So now you should be able to.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So my idea is. It's probably, it's probably easier if I just do the loft.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, all right.

[Speaker 7]
The window there.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, there's a railing. Yeah. I love body.

[Speaker 3]
So there's like, is there like a pool of blood around the ear-ish? Yes. And the crystal coming out of the front of the body.

So towards the sky.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a railing, I mean a wall between the loft and the first floor or a half wall?

[Speaker 10]
It's a railing. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, uh, you, you two, uh, Melania and I, you're more, uh, magically inclined, right? Uh, can you like see if there are any inscriptions in the crystal? No.

[Speaker 5]
I'll cast identify on the crystal then. Ritual cast.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, you told us not to cast any more magic on the crystal.

[Speaker 5]
Not on the body, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I think it was pretty specific about.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, James, what were you saying?

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So there's a little bit of a lexical ambiguity, I guess, but he's like, no, I don't want anything being cast on this.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
Um, that includes, that includes when, when I say the body, I do mean parts of the body. Even if they are.

[Speaker 3]
Is it fine to take out the crystal from the body or?

[Speaker 1]
I, we never messed around with that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Then, um, I'll cast divination first. Um, ask if I remove the crystal, if something bad will happen because of the removing of the crystal.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Can you put divination in, what's my call? Or.

[Speaker 5]
I'll just type out the question.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, perfect. I just need to see the, uh, spell's exact text. The omen you get is beware unintended consequences.

[Speaker 5]
Got it. Okay. Then you likely don't want to do that.

[Speaker 3]
Gonna go out into the, the loft and look out the window. Uh, are there any places, like, first off, is there a curtain in the loft?

[Speaker 1]
It has been drawn aside.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, what about, uh, lighting in the room? Um, if there is any, I want to check, uh, I'll fret, like, about when the last time it was used was.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the lamp is powered by a continual flame and just has shade drawn across it. There was a space lowered within that confirms with you that they did not draw the shade over it. Um, so it is, so the loft is currently lit by continual flame lamp.

[Speaker 3]
Um, are there any buildings that would be good vantage points to look out into this, uh, loft specifically within 500 feet?

[Speaker 1]
Within 500 feet? Uh, yes. Within 500.

So with, let's see here. Most of the buildings across the street are shorter, but about 500 feet away. A lot of Broadmont is actually built into, like, the hillside.

Very hilly region. Um, so the hill, it's, so while the buildings across, no, no vantage points, but one of the hills within probably about 500 feet would have, uh, if somebody were at the top of that, they could look in.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. There might have been some magical shenanigans going on. Uh, you know, a sort of dimension door thing from that hill over there is a possibility.

[Speaker 2]
Would explain why the footsteps were, and why they need to bust the door out, but not in.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Wait, they didn't need, uh, the door was closed.

[Speaker 2]
Why they could get out without touching the door.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Uh, I'm gonna, like, get really close to the floor and, uh, look for any footsteps coming from the window into the room that don't match the victims.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, make me an investigation check.

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
And an Arcana check. Uh, though somebody else is free to make the Arcana if you want to pass it off to them.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, so I'll do the investigation first. Alright. Do I notice anything that would prompt the Arcana so that I can ask somebody else, or do I have to do the Arcana as well?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you could, you could ask somebody else to do the Arcana.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll ask them. I don't know who's the best one at that, so just open-endedly say, there's some magical shenanigans going on. Anyone can help?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I can try to handle it. I do believe Melania is better with the Arcana, but I can try. And I will go ahead and try, and if I don't get something good, I can have, I have my focus points, actually, so.

Uh, that's, that'd be a 19, because I'm just adding the four focus points for my charisma modifier.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Okay, so first the, first things first, Mark, you're leaning down next to the window, um, looking carefully over the floor. You see a few little pieces of glass, um, you see, like, very fine dust.

Yeah, a few pieces of glass, uh, and a very fine dust that you can probably assume is made of the same material, in the rough shape of a footprint. It's almost impossible to see from anything except, like, a side view. You have to be looking at it from the side with the light being cast on it, uh, to really notice that it's there.

And you see at least three more such footsteps moving towards the, uh, moving towards the body. And I, looking at the window, trying to draw up a little bit of Arcane Sight, trying to figure out, um, trying to detect, uh, any signs of, of magical entry, as Mark has suggested, you see the imprint of a person, of a close person, coming through the window, like it is on the window.

[Speaker 3]
Now, that is weird.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, it seems the killer, well, most likely the killer made their entrance through here, so now they got out the window and then climbed inside.

[Speaker 3]
So, it's a glassamancer.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly. That's, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Either that, or something that comes out of some sort of a mirror, or heard stories about that. Don't like them.

[Speaker 4]
Whatever it is, it would explain why there's, um, prints in the blood, and then the door downstairs is broken, because they didn't enter through the door.

[Speaker 3]
Now, why this person? I should have probably asked this before. I'm gonna, like, still look, like, very close to the floor.

I'm gonna, like, rabbit walk towards the officer, and then stand up straight, and go, um, yeah, I took a long time to ask this, but, uh, who was that guy?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Cyrus here? Hey, he was just a regular merchant. Mostly kept to himself.

No, uh, no wife, no kids.

[Speaker 3]
What sort of merchandise did he trade in?

[Speaker 1]
Tapestries, mostly. Bargained a little bit of, uh, carpentry for folks up north. Some barters, trades.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm, he must have a ledger, then. Eh, let's take a look at it, and I'm gonna start going through his stuff, looking for a ledger of, uh, bought tapestries that he planned to resell.

[Speaker 1]
Like, yeah, that's, that'd be at his place of business, not here.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I'll make a mental note of that. We should look. Maybe something he bought was cursed, or some thing like that.

[Speaker 4]
Is his place of business far from here, or is it close?

[Speaker 1]
Nah, it's fairly close. I want everybody at this point to make me a perception check. Still waiting on Joe, and there we go.

All right, Battleheart, you smell smoke.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, does anyone smell smoke? No.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, god. I look out the window.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing out the window.

[Speaker 2]
I go to where I smell, towards where I smell the smoke coming from.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, it's coming out of the air vents.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, we need to move this body, because there's something in this building that's burning.

[Speaker 3]
Yep, I run to the body, and I say, sorry, officer. I grab it, and I hop out.

[Speaker 2]
And I help him move the body to the window.

[Speaker 4]
You're going to hop out the window?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's something burning in the building. It's coming out the air vents.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I don't see anything burning, right? So, can I make another perception check, since I was prompted?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, was that a no, or a yeah?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can. Um.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I guess I really don't see anything, so I'm going to stay put, then, until further evidence.

[Speaker 1]
There's no fire right now, let's see if you guys smelled anything.

[Speaker 4]
I'll also do another one, because they're mentioning something burning or something.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you guys continue investigating this. I'm going to see what I'm smelling. It might be just some turkey in the oven or something.

[Speaker 4]
Would it be best for us to split up? I don't think that would be best.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, true.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, is this an apartment or a house?

[Speaker 1]
Apartment. It's an apartment. Oh, right.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so before I jump out with the body, I'm going to try to jump to the floor above.

[Speaker 1]
What? I don't know. What do you mean, the floor above?

You can't just jump to the floor above. Sure I can. You can climb just out of a building.

No, you're jumping out of a window.

[Speaker 8]
Uh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Fine. Yeah, I'll just pop my head out and look to the floor above and see if there's anything going on.

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't look to be anything going on just now. Um, Mattel Heart, you said you're going to investigate the source of the smell. Melania, Inai, and Cheryl, what are you folks doing?

[Speaker 2]
I decided against investigating the smell because I heard someone ask, are you sure you want to leave the party? So I decided to stick with the party, but be prepared to grab the body and run out the building. So I'm sticking by the body.

Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just sort of waiting to see what happens because as far as I'm aware, there's nothing actively dangerous happening.

[Speaker 6]
So we're in an apartment, right? Yep. I get, like, one of the neighbors and be like, knock on the door and be like, hey, do you smell smoke too?

Or is that just us?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they're coming out in a bathrobe, uh, carrying their purse. Like, uh, yes, yes, I, I was just going to, uh, I was just going to leave and see if I could find some help.

[Speaker 6]
I'll tell the rest of the party that it's like, guys, people are also looking to get out.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, grab body and say, if others are smelling it also, I'm grabbing body and let's get this body to the precinct. Shall we?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Uh, uh, let's see. You three, none of you are, is it water next door, right?

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, as far as we're aware, there is, we're unable to determine a location of fire. It's just smoke at the moment.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but smoke rises and we're on the third floor. So I'd rather be... So, yeah, I'd rather be out of the building before the fire reaches up.

[Speaker 4]
Um, about how far are we, like, from the ground level in terms of feet? Am I able to tell, uh, James?

[Speaker 7]
How far up would the floor be?

[Speaker 4]
Like, if I was looking out from the window to the ground outside, how, how much feet would that be?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, looks like about, um, looks like about 30 feet.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so for the sake of, uh, to expedite things, I'm going to starlight step out towards the ground and then, uh, see what I can see, uh, if I can see any fires on, from the outside of the building.

[Speaker 1]
From the outside of the building, you can't see any fires, no.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I kind of just shout up that I don't see any fires from the outside, and then we'll see what they do.

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, a bunch of people have started shouting, fire! There's a fire! Uh, and begun, uh, getting ready to get out of their, uh, get out of their houses.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm going... Go ahead, go.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, uh, I suppose we should get out of here with the bodies since everyone's clearing out.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna turn, uh, the office turret set, uh, best we get out of here. You don't mind if we move the body now, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I guess I don't have much of a, much of a choice. Here, I don't want folks to panic more. Let me, let me get these folks, uh, out of the building first, and this force, so they don't panic when they see the body.

Good idea. I'll call back, uh, within a minute.

[Speaker 3]
All right, as he's going out, I'm gonna...

[Speaker 6]
Can I run, like, an autopsy check on the smoke? It's like real smoke, or like, an auditory illusion.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make a, uh, check, investigation check, or a semi-thorough.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that goes through. I'm using, um, BEYOND20. Did it go to be, to foundry?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it doesn't look like it.

[Speaker 6]
How do I roll on foundry?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, BEYOND20, I'm pretty sure, is just for, uh, roll 20. No, but, um, how do I actually roll on? Uh, just do, so, click on your character sheet.

What? Have you not accessed, how have you not accessed your character sheet yet? All right, um, really, what's, all right, what's your bonus?

[Speaker 6]
It's a plus one.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops, that was 1d10. Uh, 13, you, uh, you're trying to, like, see if this smoke is, like, real or not. All of a sudden, it feels, you're, like, smelling.

Try to remember the scent of your mom's cooking, and how often she burned it, and all of a sudden, the smoke feels a lot more like, just smells pale. It doesn't have a proper flavor to it, and it doesn't sting your nose as much when you breathe it in.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 6]
Well, y'all, feel free to stay, or feel free to go, but I think I'm gonna stay here. I don't think this is real smoke. Eh?

Eh?

[Speaker 3]
What do you mean not a real smoke?

[Speaker 6]
Take a deep sniff. Does this feel like real smoke, or does this smell like real smoke to you?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll try a real deep sniff and see if it seems like real smoke. As I try that, and where am I rolling?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, uh, go ahead and roll an investigation check with advantage. Nice. Yes.

All right, you beat it. Uh, you're pretty confident that you're a seasoned adventurer. You're pretty confident this is an illusion.

An olfactory illusion.

[Speaker 2]
Damn it! Who's the wizard that's messing with me now?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna cock my gun, and I'm gonna, like, I'm gonna turn to Jaeger, and I'm gonna go, hunting time. Nobody makes fool out of me. I'm gonna start, like, looking for, uh, any people that are, uh, acting suspiciously.

[Speaker 1]
Here, yeah, all right, boss.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'll stand guard over the body, though, because I'm figuring that's the objective of this wizard. They're trying to get us to abandon it, and it's not letting me place down my token. Already?

[Speaker 1]
So, I don't know why it's not letting you place down your token.

[Speaker 7]
There you go.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, okay, so go ahead and make me a, kind of, like, searching check. It could either be investigation or perception.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, let's do perception.

[Speaker 4]
Is this the entire group?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, so it looks like average Joe, or Joe Average. Yeah, yeah, so do you know where the actors tab is in, um, in Foundry?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm on it right now.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, can you see anything?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I see, like, all of our characters' names and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
No, so can you see, can you see your character's name?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So you see the folder that says Joe Average?

[Speaker 8]
Huh?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, do me a favor and share your screen with me while I, uh, while I do this. Um, all right, so both of you. All right, so Battleheart, keep an eye out up top.

Uh, Battleheart, you see, um, nothing outside of the tier. No, no, okay, so you are somebody who, uh, is across the way on one of the hills. Let's look out.

They appear to have some kind of a telescope with them.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Looking up, trying to get a line of sight up and into the loft.

[Speaker 2]
I would, do I see our rifleman?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the rifleman is, are you guys, uh, Mark is, like, going downstairs, right?

[Speaker 2]
Hey, Mark, I see somebody.

[Speaker 1]
So Mark is at the, at the stairwell at this point.

[Speaker 3]
Do I hear it at all or not?

[Speaker 2]
You look like it's down to you.

[Speaker 3]
I go, oh, uh, I go hopping back, take the, uh, the sights on the, the rifle, and then look to see, uh, if there's someone while closing the, uh, actually, close the shades before and then put the gun with the sights.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, then you got an 18, so tracking the, uh, at this point, Lord, the thing comes up and says, all right, uh, stairwell's clear. Are we gonna, we gonna evacuate? We discovered it's an illusion.

[Speaker 2]
What? We think we have a spot on the mage that did it, but we need to figure out how to get at him without blurring him that we know where he is. Think you could send some guards to the hill over there?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, yeah, we'll get right on it. And in the meantime, I mean, you're still outside, right? That works.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, are you, or do you want to be, or I mean, you mean me or no?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I mean, Melania, like whoever Melania, I think teleported outside, right?

[Speaker 5]
No, that was, uh, oh, sorry. Um, don't worry about it.

[Speaker 1]
So, Anna, you saw, um, while people were rushing outside, you saw one person put up their hood and cloak. Uh, they were carrying a book and they're swiftly running towards the east.

[Speaker 4]
Um, did I see this just now or did it, was this like a little bit ago?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you see this pretty much just now. It's, he's like the last guy out.

[Speaker 4]
And they're just like rushing out with a book, you said?

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Considering how shady everything is, uh, you know what? Hold on. Let me see.

But yeah, shady person in a possible serial killer situation is going to hold person.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I just want to expedite. Are you fucking, oh, that was not, okay.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that was me. I, I'm clicked on Mark for some reason. Okay.

Mark has a higher, uh, wisdom score than that, but yeah. So they feel something and then they shake it off for a moment and then they get the idea, uh, and cast invisibility on themselves.

[Speaker 4]
I basically shout up to everyone that, uh, the killer was, or someone who I think was the killer was inside and they've just started retreating away. Okay. Do we hear that?

[Speaker 3]
Absolutely. In the meantime, uh, the person on the hill, did they make any moves after closing the blinds?

[Speaker 1]
Can you see them right now?

[Speaker 3]
I, so after closing it, I, yeah, I opened the crack with the musket.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, yes, you would be able to see that. It doesn't appear so they have, they have not moved as of yet.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Uh, let's see if I have something with a little bit more range to it. And there we go.

I'm a shitty sniper. I can only reach a hundred foot.

[Speaker 2]
Well, our teammate found something and perhaps we should investigate.

[Speaker 5]
Aren't they in the middle of shooting somebody? Can you let them finish? So we're not doing like five things at once.

Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
It sounds like right now they can't actually do it because they're out of range.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So yeah, I'll go with you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're going to go downstairs and join with the one who just screamed. They saw the guy running down the street.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to stay at the window, right? And I can, I can see your right. Or an eye, right?

Or is the window facing the wrong direction?

[Speaker 1]
No, you can see an eye. Uh, the shape is wrong, but you could like, you could just like crack the blinds a little bit, take a look down and you'll be able to see her.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Then in that case, for my vantage point, I'm going to yell out for an eye to tell me where to cast this spell. As I cast Hypnotic Pattern, a giant lock appearing above my head.

And then I'm going to ready action for wherever she indicates. Whenever she indicates something, I'll cast it there.

[Speaker 8]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I like, I don't know if we're an initiative. I don't know if I can just do it or if she can just tell me or what, but geez.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Uh, what's your spell safe DC?

[Speaker 5]
18. I know I can see. I mean, if we're not an initiative, I'll just cast it again.

[Speaker 1]
Are we? We're not an initiative. I'm trying to like bounce around between everybody.

Okay. Because some folks are taking like group actions like you two just did. Um, we're going to resolve, uh, Misha and Mark first.

You folks are running down the stairs trying to track this person down, right?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Well, I'm trying to join an eye to see if she needs any help.

[Speaker 1]
Right. You're trying to go down and check that. All right.

Um, Dustin and... Uh, you can make this with advantage. Make me a survival or investigation check.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Let's make a survival.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. Okay. So you follow a little bit of mud around the left side of the building into an alleyway that appears to have formed itself into little footprints.

And as you look down to where the footprints lead, you see a metal gate rattling as if something is gripped onto it at the moment. But you can't see anything.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take a blind shot. So disadvantage, right?

[Speaker 1]
It'll be disadvantage since it's against a creature you can't see yet. All right. Oh yeah.

It hits. All right.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. Oh, and sneak attack. Sorry.

Let me see.

[Speaker 5]
You have disadvantage so sneak attack cannot apply.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you're right.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, but he still failed his concentration check.

So you hear somebody cry out in pain, bleeding out from the leg. Uh, just, just crying. He's like, ah, ah, ah.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just going to hop to him with the revolver still hot and place it in the wound and go, you fucking make an illusion to me, you motherfucker.

[Speaker 1]
Like, please, please. We have to burn the body. You have to burn the body.

[Speaker 6]
Who do you work for?

[Speaker 1]
I work for, we're just concerned citizens.

[Speaker 3]
Bullshit.

[Speaker 1]
I'm very concerned. Can't you hear it in my voice? Please.

I'm going to bleed out. I'm going to die. Don't worry.

[Speaker 3]
The hit from the revolver is cauterizing the wound. That's why.

[Speaker 1]
That's not how that works. I can still feel it bleeding out. You're not a medical professional.

Don't lecture me. And they fall unconscious.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll go and bring the body to the rest and I'll go, he's on his die. But you know, I put the hot part of the revolver in them, so I'm pretty sure they're fine.

Right?

[Speaker 2]
Could you tie him up while I put some health in him?

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'll tie him up the best I can.

[Speaker 2]
And after he finishes that, one point of lay on hands into him.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. He is pack up.

[Speaker 7]
So let me change the, uh, here's my simple calendar.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. What?

[Speaker 1]
All right. He is awake once more.

[Speaker 2]
Would you care to tell us who else is behind this plot to burn, well, to burn this building or body?

[Speaker 1]
Just, just a few, just a few friends.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to lift him up tight and bound as he is by the scruff of his shirt. Care to try that again? I wish her name.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, listen, listen, my, my friend Joe, my friend Joey, put, put me up to this, please. Joey who? Perhaps?

Joey, Joey Sowell, please. Okay. I'm so woozy.

[Speaker 2]
Have you talked to the constable while we pick up Joey? I'm sure he'd be most interested in hearing of your public disturbance.

[Speaker 1]
Lord, the thing comes up and says, yep. Hey, we'll put this one under arrest. Question him.

Try him for murder. Say what? I didn't kill him.

I didn't kill anybody. We're just here to burn the body. I don't need to see any more than that.

Trying to clean up evidence after the fact. I always knew you were shifty, Joey. I was at school 10 years ago.

I couldn't have been the killer. Like at school, where? That's right.

Collins Christophe College. Sounds like an open and shut case to me.

[Speaker 2]
Well, or was the teacher at the college during his tenure there the one? Or someone there.

[Speaker 1]
I don't see any teachers around here. I just see the guilty son of a bitch in front of me.

[Speaker 3]
Nah, wait.

[Speaker 2]
All we're going on is burning, attempting to burn the body.

[Speaker 1]
So. Sounds like obstruction of evidence to me.

[Speaker 2]
That'd be, but it ain't murder yet. But it is pretty bad if you think on it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna check on the hill that I was looking at before. See if the person's still there.

[Speaker 7]
They are no longer there.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, fuck. I see a flare go up from behind said hill. It is blue in color.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, fuck. I'm gonna jump to, like, I'm gonna run to the, back to the apartment.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. You run up and you see a bunch of guards apprehending the person that you saw on the hill prior. They went out, put your instructions to that, to the west.

And then to the north and managed to catch the guy.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, they caught him in the apartment?

[Speaker 1]
No, they probably brought him. You're talking about the guy in the hill, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they went to the hill and, uh, not because they saw.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, and got the guy.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they saw a suspicious character on the, uh, just on the hill looking in the direction matching the subject description, um, with a telescope and nabbed him.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, what about, uh, on the apartment? Is there anybody there or is it clear?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you just ran down. Where did, where did you just run to?

[Speaker 3]
So I, we were outside. I ran back in when I saw there wasn't anybody on the hill.

[Speaker 1]
You ran back in?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. Um, all right.

So you don't, you don't see that then, uh, you go back into the apartment, you don't see anybody on the hill, uh, and you're inside.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, the body's still there?

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
All right. I'm gonna watch the, like, thing unfold from there. Just making sure nobody takes the body.

[Speaker 1]
Cool, cool, cool. Uh, what are the rest of you doing right now? This is, this is pretty much, uh, this encounter resolved.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Say to the sheriff, if you manage to find the guy on the hill, set these two into separate things, have them spill out their guts, and I'm sure you guys will manage to catch them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we're not gonna disembowel them. We hang them.

[Speaker 2]
Well, first get the info out of them.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Then do that.

[Speaker 1]
All right, all right.

[Speaker 2]
As I hold out my hand in a grasp, not grasping, uh, clasping motion.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he takes it. He's, uh, pleasure doing business with you.

[Speaker 2]
Pleasure doing business with you.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. So, uh, I'm gonna send my boys in to go collect that body. Uh, if you folks need to do anything else in the, in the apartment, uh, you're free to, but this is, um, we're probably gonna close that down by the end of the day.

[Speaker 5]
I do want the crystal, at least.

[Speaker 2]
I'd say that's probably not going to happen. That's a crime scene in, in evidence, if I were to speculate on it. So perhaps someone at the nearby college could help unravel its secrets a little better.

[Speaker 6]
Why don't we burn the body? Because, like, we don't know for certain it can release an evil demonic entity.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe they'll actually stop. We don't know for a certain it will either. Or if it won't.

So it's best to leave it as a do-no-harm thing.

[Speaker 1]
Lord steps in at this point. He's like, it's, it's not a matter of, uh, it's, it's not a question of, uh, what do you folks think is best here? We're taking the whole body and we're not messing around with that crystal.

That's been our policy ever since this first happened. We're not messing with the crystal.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, I got the firebolt cantrip. So, like.

[Speaker 2]
You keep that firebolt to yourself. We are paid to investigate, not burn the body.

[Speaker 6]
Like, we will die because I didn't burn the body. It's not my fault.

[Speaker 1]
What? In any case, if you folks are still intent. You know what?

I think I'm just going to close the whole apartment up. If you folks want to investigate the victim, Cyrus, was last seen at the Prancing Kelby before he died.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, we're going to put that body under lock and key. See a bunch of folks, uh, hauling a coffin up the stairs.

[Speaker 2]
Well, sounds good to me.

[Speaker 1]
Cool, cool, cool. Uh, anybody else? What are you folks trying to do?

[Speaker 3]
Uh. Oh, uh, the shop. I'm going to the shop.

[Speaker 7]
The tapestry shop?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, the tapestry where the victim worked.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Well, so you go over there. Uh, Anai, Cho, and Melania. What are you folks doing?

[Speaker 4]
Just kind of taking grasp of the whole situation as I think of my next move. Um, just give me a second.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, there's a bounty, right? So I guess we can go collect it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, because from what we know, that could have been and probably was the killer, right?

[Speaker 1]
Morgan's like, yep, once I get this through trial, it'll be pretty easy just to toss that money to you folks and enjoy my nice new, well, there's no more promotions for me, but I know a little bit of prestige. Maybe some free drinks. They're pretty open and shut case to me.

All right. So, Mark, you make it to Cyrus Silks, the store that this fellow used to work at. The door is open.

There's just an apprentice working in the shop.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna hop on over to the counter and I go, so this might be a bit hard to believe, but I'm working with the local authority on your boss's murder and I'd like to see the ledgers.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure. Here's again, go ahead and just make me a general investigation check for this.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck. No, that's pretty good. You're pretty confident that there's nothing of obvious relevance to your current case, but there was an interesting note earlier in the ledgers about shipping smothering carpets up to a sheriffs, the city of sheriffs.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well, it seems like I got to go back to a sheriffs again. Oh, God.

[Speaker 1]
I was made out to one McKeith, the magnificent.

[Speaker 3]
I just turned to the apprentice and I go, we're going to talk about this later. I got more stuff going on and I leave the shop and go back to the group.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, what? Just making sure I still had sound.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, you do. You do.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, in the meantime, Battleheart, you make it over to the Prancing Kelpie.

[Speaker 2]
I decide to sit down and wait for my party to arrive. Figuring they'll be around shortly and I order some wings, breadsticks, and an ale or two.

[Speaker 4]
Did you let us know that you were going to the- I think I did. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I would imagine so. I mean, you could also figure it out from context clues.

[Speaker 4]
That is fair.

[Speaker 1]
So yeah, is the party moving on to the Prancing Kelpie or are they looking to do something else right now?

[Speaker 4]
Um, yeah, you can head over there.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. All right, you all meet at the Prancing Kelpie. Barkeep takes notice, like, hello, hello.

Caleb, pleased to meet you folks. Pleasure. What's up, doc?

So, uh, what can I get for you folks?

[Speaker 2]
Um, a couple ales, please.

[Speaker 3]
You grew up carrots in this town? We sure do. What about chicken?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, we have carrot cake pan- carrot cake pancakes. We would like some. They're pretty delicious.

[Speaker 3]
And yeah, there's some rotisserie on the house. Actually, the carrot pancakes do sound good.

[Speaker 2]
Got any potato pancakes? Sure do. I'll take one- a couple of those with my ale.

[Speaker 1]
Ball kill is moving on. He's like, oh, don't- don't sit in that- he points to one of the seats, like the second last to the, uh, uh, second last to the edge. He says, oh, don't- don't sit in that one.

Bad luck. I'll be back with your food. Takes him about, uh, 30 minutes to come back.

Or sorry, not 30 minutes. It takes him about, uh, 10 minutes to come back with your food. There's a lot of good stuff they already have on.

[Speaker 3]
All right. In the meantime, I want to see if, uh, there's any, like, physical- anything physically wrong with the seat.

[Speaker 1]
Going to make an investigation check?

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I'm pretty sure there isn't, but okay.

[Speaker 1]
I get fairly confident.

[Speaker 8]
Yep. Mm.

[Speaker 2]
I'll ask the bartender for the story of that seat when he gets back.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. When the bartender comes back for your food, he's like, oh. Uh, he leans in, he's like, it's- it's bad luck to sit in the seat of a man who just died.

[Speaker 2]
I see, I see.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Somebody. Raleigh community member was murdered last night.

[Speaker 8]
Mm.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I'm really sorry to interrupt, but given that we've collected the bounty, I don't think Anai and I have any reason to stick around. So we're gonna just go back to the college and leave this session. Uh, thanks for DMing for us.

Um, yeah, I don't think this session of this game will work out for us in the future. So thank you.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Peace.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
Peace. Okay, how much is the bounty per person again? Eh, that's another matter for a later time.

Yep. Uh, perfect balance. I'm trying to think if either of the two here would be interested in a wager on how much they could drink versus me.

No, apparently not. That's weird. Joe also bounced.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's, uh, time to end session then apparently.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess. Um, I don't know what was going on there, but. I don't know.

[Speaker 8]
Eh, I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't think it was, uh, hmm. I mean, do you guys have a sense of what's, what's going on? Is like, there's one guy trying to burn the body.

He's probably, you got an overenthusiastic, uh, constable trying to railroad this guy.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I got the like, oh, uh, I'm looking for the easy way out kind of thing. But I didn't want to say, oh yeah, no, it's the cop a hundred percent. Uh.

[Speaker 2]
I just say that he just wanted to do something and we were told that is not a good idea and most, the rest of the party agreed on that, but yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it was pretty suspect that he didn't, uh, let us identify the crystal or use any identifying magic on it.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. I feel like that. I feel like that was consistent with the, um, no, no, I was just trying to figure out a proper way to finish my thought.

I feel like that was kind of consistent with how he talked about the, uh, talked about the crypt like, oh yeah, we don't want anything messing with this because we don't know exactly what it does and it's like pretty obviously a trap.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no, I guess, I guess it's because I'm thinking that I was like, yeah, there's no way a divination spell is going to trigger a conjuration crystal, but that's like very presumptuous of me to think the guard would know that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it would be because they would have a arcana skill of zilcho modifier, so to speak.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, something that's not terribly impressive, right? The what? Like, they wouldn't have an impressive modifier to it, I think is what you're saying.

Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, like, if anything, the person on the hill was the most suspect one.

[Speaker 10]
True.

[Speaker 3]
But then again, they only had a binocular and we did leave the body alone, so I don't know.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Like, I don't, I don't think it would have been the guard because from what we've seen was somebody that could use some kind of magic.

[Speaker 2]
So I know for dispersing that crowd, I get an extra 200 XP due to the one minstrel feature.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, you would. I would hand you guys XP. I'm sorry that I ended swiftly.

I had a whole, I was expecting the apartment thing to go by much faster, but Yeah. God, I had a whole fucking session planned out for this one. That's annoying.

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
It's not your fault, honestly.

[Speaker 2]
It's not your fault.

[Speaker 3]
Like, I feel like I'm more at fault because I accidentally hung the letter to spotlight, even though I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like you were just being proactive. I haven't been able to get, um, I hadn't been able to get Sona to, like, move things along. Hardly ever.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, sorry, what?

[Speaker 1]
Micromism, I guess, or yeah, the person playing Melania. They've been in, like, two sessions. Um, one of them went, like, the first one was a little bit rocky.

But, um, hmm. Oh, well. Yeah, I don't know exactly what's going on there, but.

Yeah, that is annoying, though. I had this whole fucking thing written up. All you guys had to do was get to, like, uh, pass this one thing that just took over.

What is it? We're like two hours into the session now. I was expecting this to finish, like, within an hour.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's because I, I took a lot of the, like, oh, oh, I'm investigating. So I want to look into every detail of this.

[Speaker 1]
No, no. So the past hour was the, I mean, smoke thing.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, the smoke thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And it was just like, um, if one of your parties starts saying that they're, like, hearing or seeing things, I generally think of that as being a good time to, like, start investigating around and, like, taking actions. Like, and I, you had a pretty good idea, which was like, I think this is maybe an illusion.

I think this is maybe fucked. But we just had this long stretches where nobody was doing anything.

[Speaker 2]
I only silenced up every once in a while because I wanted to give a chance for others to do things.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, like, even- I'll tell you guys right now, you are totally fine to play this, like, uh, like, fucking, I don't know, tennis, where, like, every time I set up the ball for you guys, you guys hit it back and stuff like that. Don't be afraid to, you can check in with your party and say, hey, uh, did you guys want to do anything?

Um, I've been talking, I know I've been talking for a while, but I wanted to include you guys and stuff like that. But it's, it's pretty common to have, like, a caller, what's called a caller in the party, who just, you know, calls the shots and, uh, says XYZ.

[Speaker 2]
True. I just was trying to give them a chance to do their actions if they were doing them, if that makes sense. Not that me and Mark were doing everything.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Uh, that's, geez, that's fucking annoying. I guess, I guess we are going to cut it short here, uh, but I'll tell you what, we have a little procedure for, uh, handling mini-adventures, if you folks are interested in it, um, and basically what happens in mini-adventures, anything you folks manage to achieve in the session, you can, um, yeah, Joe Average left too.

What the fuck? I couldn't even get that guy to set up his character correctly. What a waste of time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, he left the server?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess he was with the other folks. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, and he does one session and that it on trying?

[Speaker 1]
No, he did, um, he was here for the first session that the other folks were. Here for too.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was here too. I'm in playing. You gotta at least give it three sessions of rolling before you make any calls like that, I'd say.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe, honestly, these folks, they might have already known. I don't know. I'm, I'm having trouble figuring out what they, um, having trouble figuring out what exactly they prefer.

I don't know if they prefer like spoon-fed D&D or just like a shit ton of combat D&D. Um.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you can't please everybody.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
There's a set of bounty, geez.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe you should just, I should. What's a spoon-fed D&D? I, I, who knows, like story gaming, but there's a lot of, uh, I guess, is this story gaming?

This might be story gaming, who knows? This is story slash RP. Right.

This is like, uh, this is like problem. This is kind of like puzzle solving D&D for this session. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Which I enjoy occasionally having a session like this.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I thought.

[Speaker 2]
A good break.

[Speaker 1]
I felt bad for, uh, I felt bad for What's-Her-Face, uh, for both of them in the prior session because I was like, oh, I have a bunch of combat encounters that are lined up for the Cloud Forest because I, I made a bunch of them in my prep time. I didn't have any, uh, the only prep time I had was that session, basically. Um, I told them as such, I was like, all right, uh, y'all didn't give me any additional details for this prior, but I can string something together.

So once you guys choose, we're just going to break for like 20 minutes and then I'll get it all together. I got a bunch of combat encounters together, but when we met the first combat, they took so long. They spent like an hour on, on like one creature that had 60 hit points.

Oh, gee, were they just really bad or? No, no, they were just taking a long time to decide shit. I think they were just like, not used to it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Yeah, because like, if it's, if it was combat, I would have just, uh, gone and said, hey, Gustin's gonna go to Aesir Girth and try to solve the situation there.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Because I know that's going to be a lot of combat.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well. For example, my turn as my paladin is possibly attack, attack or attack. Yeah.

Attack, attack, shove with shield first, shield master or shield of faith.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty simple.

[Speaker 2]
Or some other spell.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's, that's good. I've played with, uh, I've played with Mark before. Mark is very quick in combat.

It's, it's a lot of fun.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Just, here, hold this, here, hold that.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's very good. Yeah. So what we'll do is we'll set up a little mini adventure thread so you guys can keep, uh, keep investigating and maybe basically you can, um, because I don't know if we're going to return to this thread again for a while, but if you want, you could basically keep using the text chat to, um, to keep investigating this.

All right.

[Speaker 2]
I'm actually going to bow out of this session.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're going to be closing out the session here.

I guess I'm going to go buy some groceries and, uh, fix up some chores, but.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. And I got supper to eat that's in the microwave. But, uh.

[Speaker 3]
Actually, I have some annoying thing, annoying, uh, questions that I want to ask you, James.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, man, shoot.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Mike, thank you for joining the session. I'm sorry that you're first.

I'm, God, I feel so fucking bad for you, man. You organized the session and, uh, three people just left the fucking server.

[Speaker 2]
No problem. It happens in a Westmarch time to time.

[Speaker 1]
The good news is we have like five people that came in this past week, so you will be, you will be kept in well, good company, I'm sure.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So it's 10,000 gold split five ways or two ways? I mean, 10,000 five ways.

[Speaker 1]
I guess it would have been five ways. Um, so you two get, um, 2000 gold.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. Um, where would I buy a set of plate since I decided to downgrade to splint? And where would I buy a room for a month or two?

[Speaker 1]
A room for a month or two. In Bronlock, you could get one at the Dancing Kelp, at the Prancing Kelpie.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. How much would be a room for that long?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that one is more high living. So I think it's like, I think it's what, either two or five gold per day. Okay.

But if you're living in like a high society place, it generally nets you like better quests. It's a little bit easier to, um.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So two gold per day. So that's 31 times two.

That's 62 gold.

[Speaker 1]
Also. And then if you go into foundry, if you go on the little, uh, see here, it's the thing that looks like a bookmark called journal notes on the left side.

[Speaker 2]
Journal.

[Speaker 1]
You see that little panel like token controls, measurement controls, tile controls.

[Speaker 2]
It's not letting me click it.

[Speaker 1]
That's, uh, it should be all the way on the left side of your screen.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm clicking journal, the journal.

[Speaker 10]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Should be right under the little, uh, music box thing. Ambient sound controls.

[Speaker 10]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
I see the one under drawing tools and measure distance. But I'm.

[Speaker 1]
All the way on the left side. All the, like, all the way.

[Speaker 2]
I am on the left all the way and it says journal notes. It's just not letting me click it.

[Speaker 1]
Weird. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Am I not. Incorrectly? Or.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. I don't know why it's not working. Uh, I'm gonna TM you the symbol to make sure you're clicking on it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Maybe it's just a different journal notes I'm looking. Yeah, that's the one I'm clicking.

It's just not letting me click it.

[Speaker 1]
That's, uh, extra fucking weird. Okay. I don't know what's going on there.

Uh, but I am going to click on the.

[Speaker 2]
Is it permission or something that.

[Speaker 1]
It might be permissions. It says.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to click on configure permissions. Modify configuration setting. Uploading files.

Template. Journal entries. Journal sidebar.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. I. I don't see what's going on there.

Uh, but I will mark for you on the. Let's see here. It is the third of this month.

So mark for you on the third of two months from now. Um.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Battle hearts. Rent renews.

[Speaker 2]
And is there a banking system in. In this world.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what do you mean banking system? Like, what are you trying to do?

[Speaker 2]
Power gold. So I'm not keeping it directly on my person.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 2]
It makes me weigh a lot less. Let's see. I only need about 100 gold on me at max at one time.

So. I'll put. Where.

Where is the place to put.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so I think the. So I think simple calendar. If you exit out of it.

Um, you won't be able to. See it. So if you exit out of it at the start of the session, I don't think you'll be able to see it.

But if you leave it up or if you refresh, it should automatically come back. Because you do. All right.

Uh, and then, Guston, you had some questions, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Uh, so, uh, mostly downtime stuff. Uh, on my first downtime, I did research for, uh.

For the Fae and their connection to the. Sun Shrines. Did I get anything from it or.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I have to write down the, uh, impact of your research notes.

[Speaker 3]
All right. And, uh, the other downtime that I did was with, uh, Guston. Which was, uh, I wanted to train the.

The trips in Sierra's keep and hopefully get some money out of it. Like paid to instructor. Kind of thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Uh, basically going to be able to, uh, level them up, which I love.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, so how do I go about doing this? Is there any row or is it just something.

[Speaker 1]
Probably an intelligence based check.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Like figure out a check. Okay. Figure out a check that you think is applicable to war.

Right.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I mean, oh, actually let me think about it. Let me look. Cause, uh, I might have a thing for this actually.

Might have a, uh, a diplomat thing. Uh, sorry. Minstrel thing.

Uh, oh yeah. Skull skull. No, uh, yeah, but it's like, I could use the minstrel dice.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, to raise the charisma role by he would draw.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Could I? Yeah, actually.

Yeah. That could be a, can I use a charisma instead of an intelligence?

[Speaker 1]
If the, if the skill applies, uh, then I'm down for it.

[Speaker 3]
All right. Uh, what I like, cause I'm thinking, just think about it.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to make the decision right now. You still have time for the downtime thing. Um, I'm going to go grab some groceries and then we can handle this stuff probably in text.

[Speaker 8]
All right. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Uh, sorry again, guys for the, for how this ended up turning out. Uh, it was not my intention.

We'll be back to a regularly scheduled. We're back to dungeons and, uh, dungeons and combat encounters next week, I guess. Which will be fun.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. I'll see you, dude. Peace.

Peace.

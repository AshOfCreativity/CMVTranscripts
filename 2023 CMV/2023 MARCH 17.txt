[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The slavers are our friends today. But of course. I'm just gonna say let's go east unless someone has a better idea.

[Referee (James)]
All right yeah there's certainly nothing wrong with that.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We all happy uh we'll fly the dragons until we see what this is coming from and then we can sneak up maybe.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah that's like a plan to me. What time would this be? After all they're probably getting a little bit more close to night.

I'm gonna roll for weather here in just a sec.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Morgan doesn't have any of those weather taps does he?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
No I used them all last time. I have no weather taps at the moment unfortunately. I have no light taps at all.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That was a very good use of them.

[Referee (James)]
Did you want to do anything in your downtime? I don't know fire more?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Um sure I can retroactively um. I don't think you gave me a downtime. I shouldn't.

I usually don't because I usually imagine Morgan to be like sleeping in a bush for most of the week. Oh you know what I'm gonna hold on instead of that I'm gonna do that no I saw you talking about you wish more people did meditation so I'll quickly do a meditation downtime action just for you. Oh interesting.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I realized I was going to do a meditation and then I forgot by the time I was asked and I panicked and picked one.

[Referee (James)]
Brutal.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
It was just funny because I didn't do something what was it I had a well I think I can find lay taps while meditating as well unless I'm remembering wrong which is like the more likely outcome.

[Referee (James)]
Yes you can find you can use meditation to acquire more lay taps.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Give me a second because I think I have it written on my character sheet how many days before I get my next lay tap. It also might not be a weather one so unless we're jamming out on a forecast line it might not be uh you know might not uh be useful. So when you travel or meditate excellent.

[Speaker 9]
So I believe if I open up my dumb ass's character sheet.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
All right I need to I'm gonna edit that in actually travel one more day until I see I need to travel and meditate for one more day before I get my next lay tap.

[Speaker 9]
And my cross my path die is currently a d8. I think it's 1d8.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I will just do my downtime action will just be like meditation for a focus point and one day into that I get a new lay tap. So I need to roll for that correct?

[Speaker 9]
For which one I get? Okay so my lay tap is a...

[Referee (James)]
And then did you do a roll for the meditation itself?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I have not yet. I will I'm about to do that now while I'm just checking. I'm just reading the document so I know everything.

All right let's do that first then. Do I have insight?

[Speaker 9]
No I do not. Here is that. I think I failed that so I don't think I get anything.

[Referee (James)]
That's yeah unless you have somebody guiding you through the meditation. Unless there's another character available.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Jerry Seinfeld perhaps.

[Speaker 9]
All right I need to roll just a d8 now. Slash roll 1d8 boom five. Which one is that?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Elemental line is what I found.

[Referee (James)]
Already? I think in this case you just get the tap you don't actually discover a line on the map. Yes.

But you are of course as you're able to.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Elemental line tap. But because I was meditating for the full downtime after the first day I get to roll again correct? To see how long it'll take me to get my next tap?

[Referee (James)]
That sounds correct to me.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Okay so now I roll another d8. This is three. And this good that's okay that's a four card.

All right I've got a leather one. Forecast line tap. And the downtime is one full week right?

[Referee (James)]
Well actually it's specifically seven days. Or sorry six days.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah seven day six days. Okay so that was the first day and then three more days. So I've got two days left so now I roll one more.

Oh nice. And five more so then yeah so now in seven days. So five more days I get the next tap which will be a tar line.

[Speaker 9]
Will be a.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
All right I have an elemental tap and I have a forecast tap. Easy. All right well I'm dumb as a brick so what did you want the weather for again?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh just in case it gets miserable.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Okay easy.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
No I can do that. For weather.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah yeah yeah no no no I gotcha I gotcha. Contingency and all that. No I can I can absolutely do that.

I don't know if anyone else here does elemental damage. Wait what am I talking about? We're just talking about the car bombs.

So if I uh if I activate my tap and then let Zianna just go fucking nuts with fireball. I don't think anything's surviving.

[Referee (James)]
Curse me. All right so you guys are flying out. We're gonna start swinging into it here.

I'm going to do things this session. They're a little bit non-standard. First is I'll be using initiative by side.

So basically all pretty much all of you guys are going to go at the same time. You are going to roll initiative to see what kind of order you go in. But basically your team is going to be taking actions at the same time as majority of the actions of your enemies.

So you guys can if you guys wish you can spend what is basically the planning phase of each of your turns together at the same time. The second thing I'll be doing is I've figured out a method to make some encounters with like lower level mooks go by a little bit faster. The strategy we're going to be using is you'll have a set amount of time to basically beat out the encounter.

One round, two rounds, three rounds depending on how many depending on the CR of these particular mooks. It's more or less my standard for minions. If they do not, if you do not kill the minions within that set amount of time, the remaining ones are basically going to score a free hit before they either die or run away depending on how many hit points they have left.

So we'll more or less be skipping the cleanup phase of a lot of our fights because I know some of you... I like it. Hit points are just, the hit points are just so f***ed.

The hit points are so f***ed. I have Arthur Medina coming in sometime, sometime I think at the end of this month to go over the hit point. The hit points of all the creatures in Shilmas Valley and just I think pretty much nuking them into oblivion and just increasing damage rolls for damage values broadly.

I could say it. All right so that'll be there. I think all the walls are present and I'm going to drag people over.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Do I need to bring both of my characters? Do you recommend I bring both of my characters, Gene?

[Referee (James)]
Honestly, so it's going to split the XP a little bit more, but you guys, I think you guys are going to blow through each of these pretty quickly.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm just going to take Maia then.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Pierre can keep the drakes settled if we aren't bringing them into buildings or whatever.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, if you guys are going to be flying around you could choose which one you want to basically bring into the dungeon and I'm going to leave one outside as a backup.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, that's what I'll do. Cool, all righty.

[Referee (James)]
So I'm going to start. You guys begin flying throughout the mist. You travel eastward watching the beam underneath of you.

Occasionally sputters and falters for just a second before resuming its initial velocity, intensity you could say. It takes you folks probably, probably less than an hour. There are a few additional spires coming up from the sun to dark that you have to fly around.

But you do manage. Nobody, no injuries are taken, no encounters are rolled for us here. This is a place that is sort of intentionally devoid of most life.

There's even the coral which seemed at one point vibrant. Life by the now dead, practically fossilized or necrotized, petrified is probably the best word for it. Life that you saw in the coral spire is just barely struggling to eke out an existence, but everything else here is pretty much dead.

More so than is normal, even for spires. Jesus. As you guys continue flying along, you find a severe looking pointy tower embedded into the rock wall near this one.

Let's see here, east tower. This one is embedded into the rock wall that connects to the surface world. So it's not on an independent spire.

It is just on the rock wall on the very edge of this massive hole into the world below is a seemingly unnoticed by anybody, except you guys know what you're looking for. So this hazy image begins coming into focus and see the purple, blackened, this kind of dark iron alloy that's more or less been hammered into the wall and thrown into it. It's quite long, about halfway through the structure is an exterior landing pad.

It's mostly just a tower, but on the same level as the landing pad is a bulbous main room, and on flanking it on either side is an additional boxy kind of room with two stories. One of these has an open exterior, one of these has like an open facing, basically a door.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm going to be dragging. All right, yes. This image is way too fucking short.

Why is Rhubarb here? Oh, is Rhubarb not coming?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I didn't think he was. I thought we had enough people. I can bring him if people want, but...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we're good.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Thank you. Yeah, so the beam of light is coming out of the tower's network. My drawing tablet is fizzling out.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so the beam of light beneath you guys is currently coming out of the very bottom of the tower. There doesn't look to be any kind of clearance between the opening for the beam of light and anything around it or any way into whatever room is producing it, but if you focus up here, there is, or there are, above the foyer, one, two, three, four, five. There are five stories above the current level that you're on and there are five stories below your current level, and for you is a rather large area from the bottom.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I am going to be annoying.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we should be sneaky. I'm going to cast Pass Without Trace.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Hell yeah. Sure as shit not being stealthy without it. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Oh god, it's bad. Oh jesus. Indeed, lord, it's bad.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I forgot to add the 10.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh yeah, that would be 22.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Morgan did add the 10. Yes.

[Speaker 12]
Oh dear.

[Referee (James)]
This is a group stealth check. I think it's pretty reasonable for between the magic and the rogue accompanying you, folks. I think which, did Maia get a rogue archetype yet?

Yeah, I did. Scout. Scout!

Okay, that's right. I'm keeping it in mind for my session. Love scout.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Sure. It's really good because now I can actually use survival because I have expertise in it, so. Fuck, someone's got better survival than me.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Half of my utility just got swiped.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Plus 11, baby. Bitch! Look, if there's multiple things we have to harvest, I'll call upon you.

But I also now have expertise in nature, so that's good. And I think there's one where I can move if they end their turn near me. Is there?

Yes.

[Referee (James)]
No, no, I'm very familiar. So that was Nitro's stick, or shtick, because Nitro was... Fucking fighter, fighter, scout, rogue, and the prestige class we ended up making for him called sabber.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
How does skirmisher work in group initiative? Do people still have individual turns at all? Or would it just be after one creature attacks me, I'd get to move away?

[Referee (James)]
After one critter comes up on the sort of enemy turn, that's when you would be able to use this ability. If somebody came. Or if somebody had a reaction of their...

If the enemy had a reaction of their own that let them do this... If the enemy had a reaction of their own that brought them into movement with you, you would be able to stop them from doing this. So it wouldn't change from that perspective.

Okay. All righty. Snake forward.

So I move 30 feet.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Let's move. 50 feet. Huge number.

I love seeing my discord pings back to 1600.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Jesus.

[Referee (James)]
The internet's just been fucked all morning. I don't know what it is. You should have been there for the live stream I attempted to do.

Not the live stream I did yesterday, which was great. The live stream I attempted to do the day before that, and I couldn't output like... I couldn't output more than a megabit of...

I was so bad. My upload speed was capped under a megabit. The explanation was I actually did not technically have service.

It looked like I had service, but I actually did not have service. What's the explanation for the tech? And I said, oh no.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Should we be able to see the text on these? Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Yes. So I'm putting these labels here so that you guys can have a textual reference for what you're seeing in these different things. Again, both of these doors have been left open.

On the left side, you have an armory. It's very clearly an armory. There's a bunch of weapons inside.

There is a set of stairs within as well. Going further up, but there's favorite weapons of the drow, crossbows, corkscrew, a lot of, yeah, mostly crossbows, shields that are made to be used with, crossbows in hand, bucklers, scimitars, stuff like that. On the right side, where I've written tech, there is a bunch of saddles and riding gear.

Not many saddles left, actually. There's actually quite a bit of riding gear that's been, stuff that you would expect for active rides has been taken off of their mounts.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yet again, another set of stairs. There's also, you could just barely see the outlines of pens for stables.

[Referee (James)]
The foyer is, of course, empty, and at the very far side, say north, oh, I guess it's also, I guess it's also relative to the actual direction, but the north of the map, there is a staircase that goes up, and there's also an elevator.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
With a quick glance in the armory, any of the weapons magical?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Nope, does not appear to be so.

[(Dinaryse)]
Um, are there any creatures still in, like, the stable area? Or is it all, like, empty and just, like, a few spare sets?

[Referee (James)]
Are you going to investigate?

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh yeah, I'll go and peek in.

[Referee (James)]
All righty, you can go look inside the stables. All right, you hear pained, irregular snoring coming from what sounds like a huge dog. Huge dogger.

[(Dinaryse)]
Can I see them, or I could just hear them?

[Referee (James)]
The mount from your current position, you could just hear.

[(Dinaryse)]
All right, I'll just peek in to try and see.

[Referee (James)]
As you get a little bit closer, you see that it's a wyvern that's been branded. It's currently chained up, so as to further restrict its movement, and has been muzzled.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, okay.

[(Dinaryse)]
Um, does that have, like, a saddle on it, or is it just chained up there? It's just chained up. Okay, I'll just tell the group A, there's a wyvern chained up in there.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we should leave it for now.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yes, we can come back for it.

[(Dinaryse)]
All right, where are we off to? So, we're trying to go down, Albie?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
So, if all folks, do you want to go up, down?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The, um, beam was down. And wasn't it? Yeah.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I probably want to go.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
If we clear the top first, then we can go down. Yeah. So we don't get surprised by anything nasty.

Or even if we just inspect the top. I think we should go up first.

[Speaker 12]
Okay.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Do the, do the stairs and the elevator, does the elevator look like it goes up to where the stairs go up as well? Or does the elevator look like it just goes down?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, based on the structure that you've seen, you've actually taken an elevator like this before. In fact, actually, maybe not. I know that Sierra has.

I don't know if Maya has. But I also know for a fact that Morgan has.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
And Zianna, I think, has as well. Uh, bold of you to assume that me or Morgan remember anything.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Um, taking a quick look over the elevator, you can see that it goes up five floors or down four floors.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
And the stairs only go up, right? The stairs also go down. I should have just, just did not.

Oh. Okay. Okay.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Um, I think we should take the stairs up and start clearing the floors above.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah, no, I agree. Your reasoning's good.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
And then we can clear down and...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah. Now, onward. Stay within 30 feet.

Okay, five, ten, twenty. Ah! Oh, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
So that's the outside of the map, basically. If I, if I take you outside of that, do you still see it? Do you see anything?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Um, yeah, I can see, like, inside the map. And then everything else is gray. Like, there's no tokens or anything that you've got hidden out here.

Right. No, that's, that, I'm assuming you've got tokens hidden, because that's what I do when I use Foundry.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Wasn't able to get C above, whatever the, whatever the plugin is called.

[Referee (James)]
Wasn't able to get that to properly, which is a little annoying.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I haven't found a good one for Foundry. With, like, layers of stuff. Is that what you're talking about?

[Referee (James)]
Multi-layered, yeah. So I, I found one that, um, somebody demonstrated me, to me, how they use it. And it looks really good.

I have, I've just not mastered it as of yet.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, the only one I know of is really hard to learn.

[Referee (James)]
I think it's literally called multi-level. Okay, so, you folks come up onto... I'm happy to be the one I have for that one.

You guys come up on what looks to be something called... Yeah, so I think my multi-level is even... Actually, you know what?

I don't even know what, where my multi-level is on. It might be on... Controls?

I don't even know, um, any of those. Oh, you know what? I don't have it downloaded on Foundry.

Okay, I have it downloaded on desktop. I haven't, I don't have it downloaded on the server. That's why, okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Which is funny, because it shows as multi-level tokens on there.

[Referee (James)]
What the fuck? Jeez, maybe I am just perpetually confused about this. That's fine.

Oh, well. All right, so you guys come across what looks to be a mess hall. A bunch of tables nearby.

There is a book station, which is currently closed off in the back. And there looks to be, it looks like some people have eaten from this recently. Can't seem to, but you do hear some sounds rustling from the kitchen.

Nobody in the majority of the hall, but there is a doorway to it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Utilizing my, utilizing 38 and stealth, I'll peek my head around the corner.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so you see...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'll climb on the wall and peek my head down. Very good.

[Referee (James)]
So you peek your head over and you see a drow, you see a dark owl, humming to themselves quite happily, washing a couple of dishes, brewing something extra in the pot. They look to be pumping a bunch of leftovers into a perpetual stew, tossing spices and random, uh, just hucking entire plates into the cauldron. Somewhat flamboyantly, they appear to be just enraptured and whatever they're humming along to right now.

Completely and entirely.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Anything... at the kitchen? I think we're good here.

Is there a way to go upstairs further? Yes, you can go back to the, the stairs go all the way up. All right.

I think we're good here. Maya's just going to gesture. It's not to be, it's not a worry, and we should continue up to the next floor.

[Referee (James)]
I think so. Hang on for a second. So, the next room up is a barracks.

There are several, uh, closed rooms, but on the right and left sides, you can see a couple of, on the right and left sides, you can see a couple of, um, bunk beds immediately to your left and right, and this purpose, and they are occupied.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Occupied by how many people?

[Referee (James)]
So, rooms that you could see immediately, there are. He's making me lose connection for a second.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
That's just me DDoSing you, my bud. Kill him. Don't talk, no snitches, come on.

[Referee (James)]
All right, what do you folks want to do?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Um, I would like to quietly check the rest of the room out to see... Oh. Oh.

Why is this bitten? What does it look like? It looks like a bunch of empty bunks.

Probably the largest section. Nothing odd. About 22.

Five, six, ten. 22? Very quietly, I think we should go up to the next floor, and make sure there's nothing directly above us before we try dealing with these guys.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah, that sounds good.

[Referee (James)]
All right, uh, at the end of this room, by the way, is a very large, uh, very large window.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Window, sorry.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, right here.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
He wants us to defenestrate people.

[Referee (James)]
Is that the Pathfinder spell?

[Speaker 8]
I already know you know which one I'm talking about, I'm not going to clarify. Because you shared it in the server.

[Referee (James)]
Did I? I, I, yes, yes you did.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Defenestration is just a word that means throwing someone out of a window.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, okay. But I'm reminded, nevertheless, of something that, let's see, used, made to disembowel people and use their intestines as ropes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh yeah, inside ropes. It's not people, it's yourself.

[Referee (James)]
Oh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Which is worse.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Is it better? Yeah, I don't know if that's, yeah, that's, that's much worse. Worse for me.

And worse for anyone involved. If you're grabbing the rope, if you're the person, like, that's disemboweling yourself, it just all sounds distasteful. I think everyone involves, like, no, no, there's, it's one of those, like, classic, like, there's no winners here, you know?

[Referee (James)]
I think percentage, you know what, I think I could actually use something, put extra room, I could use that. Anyways, uh, the next room up is, looks to be a kind of astronomy room. Is that correct?

Yes, it is. Okay, so the next room up is an astronomy room. A number of arcane symbols relating to the position of the moons, position of the local planets, small representations of them in this room that are currently inactive, they are not.

Also a telescope with a, again, a little bit of a large window at the front to be observed.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I want to steal the telescope but I want to leave it here for when we own this place.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I want to steal it so I can bring it back here later and use it here.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, no, I think it's, I think it's better if I don't steal it now. Um, is there, the staircase keeps going up? Or is this the top?

It does.

[Referee (James)]
Next door staircase is closed. It only goes up one more level but there was supposed to be two.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we're good to fight. I don't think anything could get to us that quickly.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, it should be fine.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We should try and kill as many of the drow in this leap, which is...

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, yeah, it should be pretty easy to just stealth kill most of them.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, and like when they wake up, just fireball them or something.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
How, how certain do we want to be? How, uh, how sure do we want to be? Because I can pop my elemental line and that doubles all of the elemental damage they'll take.

You guys gonna use dragons on them? I'm just like, if I just double the damage and then fireball, I think they're fucked.

[Referee (James)]
That sounds like a good plan to me.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Will that obliterate, will that obliterate the tower? Or is it just... No, no, it's made of a very hard...

We're gonna like... Okay, let's just do that then. Let's just incinerate a room of drow.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, in this leap. What a way to go.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Can we go back down the floor please, James? Yes, you can.

[Speaker 12]
Woo!

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
So the majority of the, uh, people are grouped up like... Yeah, what's the... Fireball's like 20 foot radius.

20 foot radius, yeah.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
20 radius, spreads around corners.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Are they, wait, are these drow... Are these drow, these people? Yes.

Are they meditating? They're currently in a trance, yes. I see.

[(Dinaryse)]
I actually see what they are, I mean... Oh! Oh!

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh my god. Alright. I'm not sure what the optimal positioning of a fireball is, so I guess we should just start killing ones closest to the door.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Um, question, James. How, like, how, um, like, obvious is it when I activate, like, a lane tap? Like, what kind of, what kind of, like, things do I have to do?

Is it, like, as loud as intensive as, like, casting a spell?

[Referee (James)]
Like... Uh, I would not say it's as loud as intensive. It'll depend.

So... Hmm. If you were to conjure it here, probably after about 10 minutes, you will get some minor tremors, and the rocks outside are going to begin to glow with, like, veins of elemental energy.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think waking them up isn't the worst thing, because if they rush into position with the fireball, then we just kill them. I think we should try and kill these four first, silently, and then we can play it by ear from there. And just fireball when they start to wake up.

Then again, they auto-fail if they're unconscious. Anyway, I want to stab some people while they sleep. What are rules for, like, are there any rules for killing people while they're unconscious?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, these four, I'm gonna let you kill them while you're unconscious. While they're unconscious. I will have you make a rule each time.

Uh, do not add your Pass Without Trace bonus, though. Sorry, what? Pass Without Trace.

Don't add your bonus, but make me a Stealth Roll. Oh. All right, yep.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That's one.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
First one dead. Wow.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
A Stealth Roll for each kill? Yep. All right, second one.

[Referee (James)]
I don't think so. Oh, I think this guy's gonna start waking up as you, uh, creep towards him. Does anybody have a means of restraining this person, or, uh, quickly, quickly taking them out?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Possibly, but maybe not. Prepare today. Uh, maybe not today.

Maybe today, though! Yes, I do have it today. Uh, Wisdom Save, please.

No waking up. Just, just hold still, buddy. It'll be easier this way.

Oh.

[Referee (James)]
All right, we're gonna transition into initiative here. Sorry, fella. All right, do we have everybody here?

There's some active combat. You guys can go ahead and roll, and they'll determine your initiative. If you guys take your turns.

This is still functionally a surprise round. Not everybody gets a raid yet. And these guys are unarmored, but their weapons aren't.

Many of them do have weapons, but this time you guys are just gonna go all at once. Uh, discuss amongst yourselves what the plan is, and then I will be back in a couple of minutes.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Uh, bait them into fireball.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah, if we bait them all into the center, I can elemental line. So I think the elemental line should take effect straight away, even though James said that in, like, a little bit, um, later. Um, there'll be, like, tremors and shit, but, like, right now, right?

If I actually just be able to, like, pop the elemental line. And then, I need to get... Well, I guess it depends on how sturdy they are, too.

If these guys aren't particularly sturdy, then there's no need. You just, like, slit one's throat, right? And he was just, like, dead.

He was unconscious, though.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Is this true? Or in a trance.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Do these guys look sturdy enough to... I guess I'll just ask James that, and he can make me make a check or something. I wanna know if these guys, like, look sturdy enough to survive a fucking...

Big gay fireball. Big and even gayer. Isn't that a role in your discord?

Yeah, no, it's the role I asked for. He had to be gay with a big gay jarman, and I asked for it. I also have the big and even gayer role.

Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.

[(Dinaryse)]
I mean, if they don't die from one fireball, I could just cast a second.

[Speaker 10]
I guess, like...

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Hold up, where is it? Let me go ahead and make sure I'm not misremembering this. It says all elemental damage is doubled even from non-magical sources, and then it says the word the, and that's it.

Yeah, it's all elemental damage is doubled even from non-magical sources. Full stop. That's it.

[Speaker 10]
That's the casting word. Ah, fair enough. Hey, don't Drow not like daylight and stuff?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah, so that daylight spell would be really good. They'd have disadvantage on all their ships while they're in them.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, one woke up. Do we still want to be sneaking?

[(Dinaryse)]
I mean, yeah, depending on like how loud he's been or not, we could just like try and help us, man.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think that ship sailed if we're rolling initiative.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah, so it's violence time. Violence is never a solution. It's a question, and the answer is yes.

[Speaker 6]
And we're back.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Hello. I've added... James, how tough are these guys?

DMing essential.

[Speaker 12]
Mm-hmm.

[Referee (James)]
Uh, Bell, uh, 60 hit points each. Fuck, okay.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I am going to focus on these two. Double damage fireballs. Get them unless they make it.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah. I assume it's an action to evoke a light up.

[Referee (James)]
I assume that you would have done that before capping. Um... So you guys can take these actions in tandem.

What's everybody... Somebody give me a lowdown of what everybody is doing.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I'm gonna invoke the line like as combat starts, invoke the elemental line, so that the fireballs just one tap machine.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Do we still want to be stealthy or should I do daylight?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
The stealth ship has sailed.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Okay, so I will go with daylight. Morgan, can you get in front of... Can you get to the front, Morgan?

I don't think that daylight counts as sunlight. So they don't push up.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, does it not?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Uh, daylight might not. I think it's other spells that do?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Does dawn light? I don't think dawn does. Nope, dawn is sunlight.

[Speaker 6]
Dawn is sunlight. Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So I will do dawn then instead.

[Referee (James)]
There you go. You guys are gonna have two rounds in addition to your surprise round. Go ahead and deploy dawn.

And then, uh, Sienna, are you deploying a fireball immediately?

[(Dinaryse)]
Uh, I kind of want to wait until they're piled up. That's fine. I'll shoot a different form of elemental scorching ray at just some dudes around.

They're like sort of behind us.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, geez.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, that's bigger than I thought it was.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's a 40-foot radiance. A 30-foot radiance, yeah. 40 foot.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah, 40 foot high.

[Speaker 6]
This could be huge.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
They did get the, uh, the most incredible wake-up of all. A fireball.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I didn't realize dawn did damage.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Yeah. I believe dawn is radiant, right? Yeah.

It does not get doubled by my bullshit.

[Referee (James)]
All righty, so you guys will have two rounds, including this particular surprise round, for each of your actions. Uh, and then, let's see. Ziad, I need some damage attack rolls and some damage rolls, as well as Maya, if you're doing any.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, I'm just gonna attack these guys if you're all happy with that.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the point of something like this is basically you guys do all your actions, more or less self-directed.

[(Dinaryse)]
Uh, should I just do, like, two turns of attacks then?

[Referee (James)]
Probably.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, let's see, why not? Um, what is this thing I'm looking for?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, it's my first attack, second attack. We have advantage with the surprise round, right?

[Speaker 6]
I think the first one is actually a crit, because the critters, this one's sleeping. Oh, wait, no, never mind. You're going to have the end of it.

They're going to be awake for the fall, but it's called casting.

[Referee (James)]
It's still advantage. Uh, and then, uh, Zianna, definitely do your, I think you said you were doing Scorching Ray?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, Scorching Ray. I'll also quicken to also Eldritch Blast at the same time. Good.

Or is it that one? Um, oh, they're advantage, right?

[Referee (James)]
Mm-hmm. I have a, I have, like, a shot glass of Chick-fil-A sauce here, which is dangerously close to the shot glass of Kraken's. Who's this going to move?

That's...

[(Dinaryse)]
So that's the first turn of attacks.

[Speaker 10]
Oops.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, okay. Does a 16 hit them?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, they are presently unlocked.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, does a 14 hit them?

[Referee (James)]
Yes.

[(Dinaryse)]
Okay. So that pretty much means everything hit.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
So a 16 was hitting these guys.

[Speaker 6]
Yep. Just give me your final damage there. They won't have.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I'll roll them. If I just type in the chat, like, the d6, will it just roll it?

[Speaker 12]
Yes.

[Speaker 6]
That's like, slash r1.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Uh, this guy takes 66 damage, kills him.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And we're making two attacks, yes? Mm-hmm. Oh, okay.

[(Dinaryse)]
Very light damage. So all of the Scorching Rays did a total of 38 damage?

[Speaker 10]
Already.

[(Dinaryse)]
And an elemental's double, is that?

[Speaker 6]
Yes, it is. So you would count a lot.

[(Dinaryse)]
So it'd be 76 fire and 26 force.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty, so for the enemy's turn, they're going to start panicking, filtering out into the hallway. Pretty sure Zianna, if you want to... I know that Zianna is going to be fireballing this next turn.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yes, yes, yes.

[Referee (James)]
So if anybody... So we got round two of those guys. Rush out and pick the hall.

[Speaker 10]
Eh, good. Eh, why not?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, let's see here. Uh, does the 16 hit Morgan?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Uh, no. Usually the answer would be yes, but I am not a bear.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, shit. What's your, uh, what's your turn off?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
17. Barely misses.

[(Dinaryse)]
Bearly!

[Referee (James)]
Uh, you're gonna take a total of 13 damage. These guys just kind of run up against you and try to... try to barrel past you.

It doesn't really keep most of them in the area as they sort of realize what's happening, but also they're on fire right now. All right, it's the party's turn.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'll just go for this guy. You fireball. AOE damage.

Fire.

[(Dinaryse)]
Uh, all right, let's align with the wall panel.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm gonna quickly do my attacks. Does the 15 hit?

[Referee (James)]
15 does hit. It's both.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Is that just 12 damage? Uh, the 12 was the second attack roll. Oh, 12 does not.

Um, I'll stun and strike that guy and make a console. There it was. Neat.

Oh, punching. I think I can sneak attack with my fifth. It just feels bad.

[Referee (James)]
All right, Syanna, you can go ahead and roll your... Morgan and Peril. Where do you post it?

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh. Very light damage rolls.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Did they also do the the stuff for Dawn?

[Referee (James)]
They have not taken their additional saves yet. Is that at the beginning of the next turn suddenly?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, it's when it appears and then again at the end of their turn.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Jesus Christ. The natural 20s of 15. Can any of them make it?

I don't think so. Why do they have such a shitty, uh...

[Speaker 6]
Oh, because the constitution did one instead of a 10.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That would be plus five to each of those.

[Referee (James)]
No, it's supposed to be, it's supposed to be, yeah. Most of them are still not.

[(Dinaryse)]
Okay, if it's 12 or higher.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so 15. Only like three.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh my god, yeah. Wow.

[Referee (James)]
Um, Sienna's gonna be 52. Sienna, what's your saving throw effects?

[(Dinaryse)]
15, I think. Oh no, it should be higher than that, right?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
No, 15. 15. It's in the spell, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Do you have your, uh...

[(Dinaryse)]
Um, or... Do I just like... You must have one or more control tokens.

[Speaker 6]
Uh-huh. I think I just need the, um, the fireball spell. If it's placed in the chat, I can use it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, just ping the spell.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I'll do it again. Yeah, I'll recover the spell slot. Oh.

[Speaker 12]
Oops.

[(Dinaryse)]
Finger slipped.

[Referee (James)]
Can you just select all of the tokens, then click the... That's actually, that's literally what I did, and it puts them all in there. Oh, there it is.

Right, okay. So between Dawn and that, we're looking at... Half damage.

All of that.

[Speaker 6]
As I say, each of these guys have about 13 hit points left. Uh, they're in this area. Um, Morgan and Karen, have you guys taken your actions?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have not. Um... Oh my god, not that one.

[Speaker 10]
Oh gosh, I do not have a lot of... Molten...

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Morgan is just on standby, just like making sure they can't, like, go past him. He's, he's just like... Once, once the fireballs are all, like, done, that's when I'll, uh...

I'll see if I need to do anything else.

[Referee (James)]
Although, so with the buy side initiative, what I want you guys to do is basically commit to actions at the beginning of the round.

[Speaker 6]
Um, if you do that, you can sort of plan together a little bit easier, and it's also easier to build a disaster ward.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
All right, um, I'll, I'll just, like, smack this guy in front of me with my hammer then. All right. Just, like, try and finish off the ones that survive.

Um... I would do fireball. A flute there, yeah.

[Speaker 10]
I don't think I need to do a fireball. I think a scorching ray can do this. I'll do another scorching ray, and then...

Come on.

[Speaker 6]
This guy is the worst guy.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm mad. Oh, this is still the same round Zeyana did the fireball, I think. Oh, is it?

Oh, I didn't, um...

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you know what, you're right.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, Morgan just... The other two just hadn't...

[(Dinaryse)]
We just don't, uh, okay. Yep.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yep.

[Referee (James)]
Press next. All right, so these guys are going to go... Go.

Here. Here, they're going to fight back. Then if they're still living at the end of this round, it'll be, um...

They get a free hit off, but... All right, against Morgan.

[Speaker 9]
Yes.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
That is definitely a hit. It says, oh, is that? As is that.

[Speaker 6]
Do not have any poison attached, so that's going to be...

[Referee (James)]
All right, fucker. X rules still... Oh, good, they're still fucked.

I love that. I love that so much. I still have not figured out what's keeping them from applying the bonus.

It's so annoying. I'm just gonna do, uh... Flash roll.

All right, so Morgan takes a total of 26 damage. Damage taken. We're gonna have Zeyana.

Same thing here. Or, versus Zeyana, the same thing here. 0.2 to hit.

[Speaker 6]
6 to hit. And 14 to hit.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, ouch.

[Speaker 6]
All three of them hit?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Jeez.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, balls again. It was supposed to be 12, not 23. Jesus.

Um, so that's 16 plus... All right, so that's a grand total of, uh, 28 damage. Still have to hit.

[(Dinaryse)]
Okay. Oh my god.

[Speaker 6]
All right, versus Para here.

[Referee (James)]
The way these guys are moving and attacking, it seems like they have, like, a real home advantage. They're taking advantage of the, uh, broom closets, the different, uh, items that are still out in the hall. They're knocking over, uh...

They're knocking over, like, armor stands just to get a slight advantage. And it seems like they're really good at moving... Maneuvering within the interior of this hall.

And attacking a little bit more effectively than you would expect them to. Does a... Okay, so I think only the 22 hits Para, right?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, because it's an 18 to beat, so... All right.

[Referee (James)]
So I'm just going to add their... What's their intended damage bonus? And...

[Speaker 6]
All right, it's just 86 damage. And then one more set of attacks against Morgan. Plus his relational bonus.

Hey, that's a miss. That's a miss.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Now all the misses are coming out. I play up opening my fat mouth.

[Referee (James)]
All right. Nine damage. That's about it for that particular round.

Oh, and then we got one more for Skara.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Ah? Uh, Mai is a stun. Never mind.

[Referee (James)]
This is some real stun counter. Okay, next turn. I want all of you to...

I'm going to kill this guy. Yeah, all of you commit to your actions, and then we'll resolve them in order.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm gonna kill this guy. I'm just gonna start rolling. That's fine.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I'm gonna bonus action rage and just start clobbering them. That's good.

[(Dinaryse)]
I got a firebolt.

[Referee (James)]
And then...

[(Dinaryse)]
I'll start scorching ray. Maybe I'll just blast if they're still sudden enough. Oh, I didn't mean to roll that twice.

Oh, that's you. Okay. Two...

Lots of 14 damage to two of the guys.

[Speaker 8]
That'll wipe out, uh, two of them.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
One's just okay. Ready for damage to the stun drama. All right.

[Speaker 6]
And then, Pera, your damage will... Six. All right, Morgan, there are two...

What are you damaging?

[Speaker 9]
Um, so I'll start with the one beneath me.

[Speaker 6]
The one beneath you.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Oh, I just jumped the mask. Didn't I fucking saw the skulls on the left ones, but the, uh, targeting indicator was covering the skull on the one beneath me? All right, so this bottom one here then, uh, here is...

Oh, yeah, I'll recklessly fucking clobber him. Yes. 17, legend.

Ah, that's me done. Already? I am raping.

I am, I am angry.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, so one is going to...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
say again? Could I just have mine make another save for Stunning Strike because it ends? Absolutely.

[Speaker 6]
So this one, based on the circumstance, obviously is not going to get the free damage off. This one, however, is going to get... it's...

four... It's going to get nine damage off of Siana, or I assume four, basically.

[Referee (James)]
Helping them get off. This one is going to be more or less... the one that Mai has is going to be captured at your mercy.

Ready to kill them or keep them alive in the future. But that will be combat over.

[(Dinaryse)]
Alright, easy peasy.

[Referee (James)]
That was much easier. Easy.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Alright, I have a greater healing potion for whoever would like to drink it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Hmm. I also could just heal some people.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I don't think I'd really... we've got spell slots. And I've got a stick of free healing.

I'm going to use my stick of free healing.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm still concentrating on Pass Without Trace. Hooray. That'll last for an hour.

No one hit me, so... we're good.

[Referee (James)]
That was just spamming.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Thank you, art-stealing robots. I love my art-stealing robots. They're my favorite.

[Referee (James)]
Infinite inspiration. Because what I do is I then take these things and I'm like, alright, Texas Town Boy, Star 2, or anybody else. Alright, we use this as a baseline.

And then do this other thing. Yeah, sure. I'm like, alright, sweet.

Now I get to give you money.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Like, that's how it should be. It's not dumb idiots making anime women with massive boobs and...

[Speaker 8]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Sorry, I don't want to upset... that sounds like something Kor would do. Don't associate.

[Referee (James)]
Snake women. Yeah, okay. Hitomi Tanaka does not need to be associated with the likes of Kor.

Alright, so what do you guys do with your capture here? Do you just slit his throat, or...

[Speaker 10]
Kill him.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Okay. You folks can hear commotion outside.

I think you hear many roaring dragons. And you can hear Sierra shouting. Landy, from the outside, Sierra is...

Patrol has apparently returned. Garrowiverns. And of course they are currently being ridden by dark owls.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Sierra's tough, we should be quick. Let's go turn off this bee.

[Referee (James)]
They'll deal with it! Between the dragon breath weapons, they could probably just kill the wyverns and let the other guys fall.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, Sierra will do something. Sierra's pretty good. I think we can focus on inside.

Probably a good idea.

[(Dinaryse)]
I've still got a bunch of healing sticks charges if people need healing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I healed Morgan for 12. Had a bad number roll.

[(Dinaryse)]
That's fine. How's Morgan at?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Fine? 85 out of 120, but I still have rages and I still have my fucking bear forms. I wasn't even going to heal myself, I don't think I'm fine!

[(Dinaryse)]
You should be fine.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Still have effective HP, 6 quadrillion.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, just in case. Oh, I'll give you a little more.

[Referee (James)]
We should move down. Mm-hmm.

[(Dinaryse)]
Get 10 more.

[Referee (James)]
So, at this point... Can we just call the kitchen guy? He's set off.

What are you folks doing? No!

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Let's run downstairs.

[Speaker 12]
Mm-hmm. Yep.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Not having these guys waking up and being on top of us is really what I wanted to stop before we went down, so, good job. Well done, everyone.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Do we want to just clap kitchen guy on the way down? Should we clap kitchen guy on the way down?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm not worried about kitchen guy. I think they were more engrossed by cooking than anything else, so...

[Morgan (Caleb)]
They were! They were doing the... This is how we know it's a fantasy world.

They were happy about doing the dishes.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That'll be alright.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We'll leave.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
That better?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
They're like, off their head on drugs.

[Speaker 12]
Alright.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I can always give them an ultimatum. They can just be our cook, or they can just die. Like, keep doing the thing you like, just for us, or, you know, you're dead.

[Speaker 8]
Remember, you guys are three depressed enemies in the service. They typically do not want to die.

[(Dinaryse)]
Do we need a pottery cleaner?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, let's go convert the kitchen, then. Walla-la.

[Speaker 8]
Need wood. He's actually the most powerful person in the tower.

[(Dinaryse)]
He's the big bad of the entire game.

[Referee (James)]
He's the head chef.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Does anyone have intimidation as a skill? I do not, but... I have persuasion.

No, I have charisma.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I have, yeah, I have minus one to charisma, and no intimidation, but I could turn into a bear and smack them. That's pretty intimidating.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I could enhance ability for charisma checks.

[Speaker 9]
Sianna is literally a warlock, right?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I've got a good persuasion.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
What about intimidation?

[(Dinaryse)]
I can do... No.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I can deceive them.

[(Dinaryse)]
I've just got charisma number for intimidation. Does there have to be intimidation?

[Referee (James)]
It depends on your argument.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I guess we could decide...

[Referee (James)]
The more you speak in first person, the less it relies on... But you can't just give me the general thrust of your argument and just leave it all... Depending on how high you're at.

[(Dinaryse)]
So, we just killed all you guys, so you're kind of out of a job. Do you want a new one?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
You did turn down that last guy. It was like, hey, you just murdered my boss. Give me a job.

Please. Please.

[Referee (James)]
I think you guys gave them the location of your keep. Did we?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I thought somebody did. I know, Morgan didn't.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I don't think we did.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, that's all...

[Referee (James)]
Small error in my writing, perhaps. Still wandering the streets of Morellon.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
And let's mug them.

[Referee (James)]
All right. So, Siana goes down to the kitchen. Creaks open the door.

Here's a whimpering cook inside who's currently pointing a break-action rifle at them. It's rather beautiful. It's purple and gold.

It has appeared to have been taken out of a stash or a cache in the wall. Wow. It's glowing.

Looks magical. But the person has not fired yet because they look rather scared to do so. All right.

Siana communicates with Ben that, like, hey, we just killed a bunch of the other people here. But it looks like you're not the... It looks like you're not such a bad guy.

You're a civilian. We don't want to hurt you. Siana, go ahead.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Cooking smells great.

[Referee (James)]
You fucking nailed it. Actually, we were here to rescue folks who might have been taken out by the year. Might be indentured servants.

We're rescuing noncombatants. We really want to make sure that they're protected. You know, transitioned into a new home.

And we'd love to keep you on board. And this cook is very happy to not be getting murdered. Rather.

Like, the scene upstairs was horrifying, by the way. People were burning in more ways than one. Mostly just burning.

Like, it was the dawn. Between the dawn and the fireballs and the scorching rays and stuff like that, it smells like... Yeah.

And this cook is very familiar with the smell of pork. And they're very unsettled by the fact, you know, the smell currently coming from upstairs.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
It sounds similar, but... Like when something in the microwave catches on fire.

[(Dinaryse)]
We just walk down the stairs and there's just, like, thick smoke from just char following us.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I put a plastic plate in the microwave for 15 minutes once. I was, like, 10. I put a piece of bread on a plastic plate and put it in the microwave for 15 minutes.

[Referee (James)]
You really wanted to be thorough.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I wanted to know what happens, and I found out. You know, play stupid games and all that.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, stupid pranks.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
The best part is I never got in trouble for it.

[Referee (James)]
That is the best part.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Well, I had younger siblings, and my parents were like, there's no way Caleb was dumb enough to do that.

[Speaker 12]
I was like, yeah, no, great.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
So my younger brother ended up getting done for it. And, like, two years ago, I told him. He was like, fuck, I remember that.

You're a bastard. I thought our sister did it. She got away with it.

I was like, no, the real culprit. Because we all got pulled into the kitchen, and I got to leave, like, straight away. Because I'm like, why the fuck would I do something so stupid?

And then I left. And both of them got fucking done for it. You fucking drowned your dad.

[Referee (James)]
I would have never put him through it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I would like to start heading downstairs.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yes.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
There's nothing else up here. Not to go upstairs.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yes.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Well, we haven't been up to the final floor.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, we could ask him who's in the top floor.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The elevator.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah. It's all labeled on the elevator, right?

[Referee (James)]
All right. Yeah, so JaMet introduces himself. He's not particularly chatting at the moment, because he's still, like, pissing himself.

[(Dinaryse)]
We just say, like, wait in the lobby, and we'll leave after we're done here.

[Referee (James)]
Like, do you have friends down there?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, we do have friends outside, but they're currently occupied.

[Referee (James)]
I don't want them to accidentally shoot me. I'd rather stay here.

[(Dinaryse)]
That's fair. We'll come and get you once we've cleared out the evil.

[Referee (James)]
I'm going to lock myself in. Go ahead and knock three times to collect. Sure.

I think the warden of this place might have already left when they set off the alarm, but I don't know if maybe this place gets attacked, or maybe not. I don't know.

[(Dinaryse)]
Right. All righty then. Well, let's hope they haven't done that.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Let's go down the stairs. Yay.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yes! I love climbing stairs. So, yeah, do we take the elevator up to the top, or do we just, like, go down?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, what's your next destination, folks?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I guess we could take the elevator up to the top. I assume the elevator, we can bring it to this floor and just go up, right? Yeah.

That's how elevators typically work. All right, let's quickly do that. All right, so it comes up.

Break and kill us all.

[Referee (James)]
You guys, the elevator arrives. You guys are able to set it to the top floor. It's a relatively simple mechanism.

Unlike the prior, unlike the elevator that Sierra last encountered, which was more of like a, I almost said the word orbital, but sort of like a biome elevator insofar as how, biome elevator? No. It was just the last elevator that Sierra came across was intended for significantly longer distances, so it didn't have as many buttons or calling cards at the destinations that it arrived at.

A lot more was invested into the actual, the magic of the actual stone that served as the elevator. But this one has a lot more mechanisms built into the tower itself. So you guys call it up.

You're able to direct it to the top floor after a little bit of Elven translation. Thanks to Sianna. And you guys set it to the top floor.

It takes, once you hear a chime, more or less, it sounds like a hand bell. That resonates, indicating that you've reached the top floor, but it does not appear to open. There is a door in front of you.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Can I activate my x-ray lenses and look through the wall?

[Referee (James)]
You activate them and you are not able to see through this.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh. I see.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We will worry about this later, I think.

[(Dinaryse)]
Hmm. Does it just look like fully locked from the inside? Like is there a lock that nobody can see?

[Referee (James)]
It just has an opening. I presume that nobody has it. It looks like standard elevator doors, which part in the middle?

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
There's no handle or anything like that. It just hasn't opened. The alarm is still going off.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm guessing it's just maybe an emergency.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we should go down.

[(Dinaryse)]
There might be special loot up there that locks or something.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
We can always go back for it once we've actually done our shit here, though.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
We'll have time to strip this place clean.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Downstairs we go, then.

[Referee (James)]
All righty. In the meantime, Sierra has received a message. She completes her battle with the Geralt Weapons outside, mostly just by using the dragons you guys have at your disposal.

The Warden that Yester brought along, and Yester is sitting on the pad outside with Sierra, his three hirelings, the Warden, the Mage, and the Mage Apprentice, they've proven reasonably effective at just keeping the Geralt Weapons off. Most of them died, and obviously their riders fell to their deaths, or looked to have done so. And so around the time that that wraps up, Sierra receives a message in the Diplomat's Pouch from the Captain, Captain would have been the rank, from House Freliss that initially contracted them to come along with this job.

It says, southward beam diffused. If you overload the crystal, you can cause the entire tower to collapse. Oh.

Worked out nicely. But the, I don't know why I'm wording this like a sending spell. Whenever we send sending spells, we're definitely counting words.

But this is just the Diplomat's Pouch. You get the message. Yeah, so.

You can overload, it does look hastily scribbled though. You can overload the crystal by turning its capacitors inwards and back on one another, detonates in about five minutes, southward tower destroyed.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Didn't try any other methods, just didn't have time when the alarm went off.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
My only response is, is anything from the tower salvageable after it collapsed, or did it destroy everything?

[Referee (James)]
You hear, giant hole, lost three men. You hear an explosion in the distance and you get a very quick, you feel another addendum pop into the Diplomat's Pouch, four men.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Jesus. Alright. Let's clear out the tower.

Four L's I guess, I don't know. They could have been men.

[Referee (James)]
They did have some human, they had some like. Alright, so which floor do you guys go to next?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The one, the first below. Below where we started, I think. Alright, so I'm going to look down there.

[Referee (James)]
The first floor is... Everybody in agreement? Yep.

Yes. Alrighty, so you guys move down to the floor below. This is a security contingent.

There are two majors inside, waiting when the door opens. I need you guys to make me two dexterity saving throws. Alright, everything above a 16 is a success.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Then I am one and one.

[(Dinaryse)]
Super success.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
One yes, one no. Alrighty.

[Referee (James)]
Oh that's right, these are double. Okay, so that's 66 damage. And 54 damage on a fail.

The majors are incinerated in the ensuing blast. More or less a suicide.

[Speaker 8]
Wow. How effective was it guys?

[(Dinaryse)]
How much on success?

[Referee (James)]
So 33 on a success. Do you have counter spells? I do not.

[(Dinaryse)]
I've got fire poles. 33 if you succeed.

[Speaker 12]
That downs Morgan on the number.

[(Dinaryse)]
Are we all dead? Not me. I'm not dead, but it downed me.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I have a thing actually. I assume you're within 60 feet, right?

[Referee (James)]
Absolutely.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So I can use my reaction to cast Healing Word on Morgan.

[Referee (James)]
That might save his life. How many hit points does Morgan normally have?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I was taking 86 when I had 84. So a Healing Word will definitely put me over the threshold.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
It's two different attacks though, isn't it?

[Speaker 8]
The thing is, I figured if Morgan had less than 50 and got knocked down and then took 54 damage, he would have been dead.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
No, no, no, no. I was at 80-something. I think 85?

And then I took the 33 because I made the save for the first one, but it still doubled. So I take 33. And then I take 54 from the second one when I had 52.

So it puts me at minus two. It doesn't outright, it just knocks me. But the Healing Word barely keeps me up.

I have nine health.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I get knocked to like negative 27. I'm unconscious.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty. How's Zeana?

[Referee (James)]
Are you still alive?

[(Dinaryse)]
Not really. So we take it twice, right? Because there's two rolls.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
It's two separate rolls.

[(Dinaryse)]
Okay, so the 33 and 27 have failed and it's doubled. Okay, yeah, well I'm down.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
You outright die.

[Referee (James)]
Does Zeana succeed on both her saves? Yeah, I think if I failed I'd probably die. Yeah, that could have been nasty.

[(Dinaryse)]
I think if I failed the 33 I'd be dead. Maybe very close, I might need to fail though. But yeah, not too good.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
You didn't... Nobody died off the first one, did they? They went down, because then you'd automatically fail the second.

Zeana had more than 33 health points, right?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, yeah, I was fine.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Good, good. How's Para doing?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think I'm at 87, I think. How much damage total was that?

[Referee (James)]
If you succeeded both, you took 60.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Did Para make the first or the second?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I made the first one, but not the second one.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
So you take 33 plus 54? Yep.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, yeah, then that put me at 87.

[Referee (James)]
How many hit points does Para have?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
167? Jesus Christ. Oh my god.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That's a bit of health.

[Referee (James)]
We need a new animation where somebody deals two damage to Para. No, somebody deals like 100 damage to everybody in the party and Para's still there. Amazing.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Well, at least the two healers are still conscious, so that's good.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you guys recover. You're free to recover however you like, but the damage is the damage. What would you like to do next?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Are they still there?

[Referee (James)]
No, they incinerated themselves in the blast.

[Speaker 14]
Oh, that's what you meant by... I was like, wait, the mages came with us? What?

Since when?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, I'm going to use Prayer of Healing then.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Please stabilize me before you do that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I have to stabilize you first? What?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Well, I'm unconscious.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, I guess I can spare the dying and then heal with Prayer of Healing.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yes, please.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I figured if I just healed you, it wouldn't matter. And that's six people, and I believe we have less than that with us, so everybody gets 41.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Sick. That's awesome. Thank you.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
My spell, I lose concentration. Do a little bit extra. Because I nearly died.

[(Dinaryse)]
Okay. Who else needs more HP?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm at about two-thirds.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I am at 50 of 120. That will prompt me to use my level... I'm going to burn a level 3 spell slot.

Whoopsie. I do not have 33 of those. One of those casts a spell.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I can also do another Prayer of Healing or two. I am at like half health now. Oh yeah, it is ten minutes, isn't it?

Yeah.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
It's very much like we have a break spell.

[(Dinaryse)]
13 health to Maya.

[Speaker 12]
Thank you.

[(Dinaryse)]
And... 11 to Morgan. And I've got one emergency heal on that left.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We're taking the stairs after that. I'm going to spend 2k to cast Pass Without Trace again.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
So the next level down is... Is there anything... Go ahead.

Is there anything left on this floor that's not incinerated?

[Referee (James)]
Not really. There's just some security gear. It's basically a security checkpoint that's designed to keep folks from taking the elevator all the way down.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I'm going to roll a new stealth.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That's probably it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I forgot the ten again.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yes, the ten.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I didn't. Ah! The duality.

Morgan was the problem last time. Now he is the furthest thing from it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
23 is the lowest stealth.

[Referee (James)]
So the next level down is a teleportation room. There's a teleportation circle on the east of this floor. Doesn't appear to be much else besides that.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I guess you won't need to learn it if we're going to blow up the building.

[Referee (James)]
Sorry, there's a quartermaster's office in here. It's currently not occupied, but there's food stored and stuff like that in here. Dry foods that can be stored for longer.

Sort of, I guess, an addition to what you would find in the mess hall. Sorry, Maya, what did you say you were doing?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
No, I forget. Sorry.

[Referee (James)]
No worries. I couldn't remember if you made a comment or said that you were doing a thing.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
No, if there's nothing of note here, I think we should just head downstairs.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, the next room down is a dungeon.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Are there any prisoners?

[Referee (James)]
There are. There is a clover court, Sylvan. And there is a hyborial court, Sylvan.

Arguing back and forth. And there is also a fellow wearing a red cap. Mostly filthy now.

Pretty much everybody in here is filthy. There's a fellow wearing a red cap, rather portly. Once ostentatious clothes stripped of clear tan lines where jewelry used to sit on their hands.

They have not noticed you yet, but they are all arguing. Two Sylvans are arguing in the language of Sylvan, if anybody happens to have those two languages. And the portly fellow is mostly yelling at them, desperate to get them to speak in the human language.

Or the local common dialect.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I guess we should let these guys out.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah. I do speak Sylvan.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you do? Alrighty, so the fellow from the hyborial court is arguing. Well, if you just let us take back the valley, as it was intended, this is in the Arctic Circle, for goodness sake.

It might as well be ours. No, you're not in the Arctic Circle. It's maybe remotely close in comparison to the equator, but it's certainly not your territory.

And besides, there was a god that blessed it. Well, if there was a god that blessed it, then why did you make a pact with them to forget that the god had, well, the god's name? We don't even remember.

That was part of the pact. It's not fair to ask us to remember. What would you folks like to do?

Are you committed to letting them out?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah. I think we should just let them out.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was going to say hello.

[Referee (James)]
They all look in your direction now, noticing the folks creeping down the stairs. A little bit perturbed that they did not notice you folks beforehand. They say hello in Sylvan.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Hello in Sylvan? Only one of us speaks it.

[(Dinaryse)]
I'll reply a hello back in Sylvan.

[Referee (James)]
Again, all nearly in unison. Well, then, what are you doing here? Why haven't you let us out yet?

And the merchant in the back is like, oh, thank goodness. Please, please, I need to get back to my caravan. Please.

My shipment here will go bad if I do not save it. Probably wasted away in the unbearable frost. Please, you must let me get back to my caravan.

I must recover my goods. Please, I must get to- I'm just blubbering and crying, getting increasingly unintelligible.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yes, yes. Well, I guess we'll release them. I see no reason not to release them.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Can I roll a history check on if I recognize redcaps? Go right ahead. What do I know about them?

Are they bastards in this world as well?

[Speaker 8]
They are.

[Referee (James)]
Well, the creature redcap, yes. But this is just a human that is also wearing a redcap.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, it's not a redcap. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Never mind. Yeah, not the creature, the redcap.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Well, I'm just going to let the human out. I'm going to pick the- He's not going to be able to go very far.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Should we send him back to Eshros? Yeah.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Do I have to go with him if I use teleport, circle, or can I just make a circle, send him through, and then- Circle specifically opens a circle until the end of your next turn, so you wouldn't have to go with him. Anyone can just step through.

[Referee (James)]
I think it's teleport that you can get back with.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
The free one, I believe, is teleport, but- Oh yeah, no, that'd be painful. Because I think teleport has to take you.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yes, teleport does. Let's send them up to the kitchen. You know, the cooks might kill him.

Or just in a lobby.

[(Dinaryse)]
I mean, like- Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Send him back to Sierra.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh yeah, they finished up at the outside. Sierra can take care of this dude. And what do we want to do with the Fae?

Fae are kind of bastards.

[(Dinaryse)]
They seem fine. They're just, you know, chillin', how Fae do. I don't see an issue.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We'll let them out as well. Do I need to roll thieves tools checks for this?

[Referee (James)]
Nah, you're- Easy. Easy enough. There's also keys elsewhere in this particular level.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Alright. Release them and tell them to wait with Sierra. No funny business.

Translate that into Sylvan Fleet.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yep.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We can head further down.

[Referee (James)]
Alright. The next level is- Congratulations, it is the beam configuration room. You can see a bunch of arcane devices that are currently pumping energy in a specific loop.

Into a very large, crystalline, sickly-looking structure below it. There's a lot of fungus growing around this crystal. Looks, again, green and black and kind of mildew-y.

It's just feeding- The instruments feed electrical current into the crystal, which bounces out back into the mildew and the fungus surrounding it. And then back into the crystal again. Jacks.

Green necrotizing- Alright.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We have a couple things I'd like to do before we collapse the tower. I would like to get the chefs out of the kitchen. Alrighty.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, is your plan to collapse the tower, or- I thought you guys were keeping this one.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I would like to, but- We don't know how to do it without collapsing the tower.

[(Dinaryse)]
We could try and fiddle and see if- We know the way to collapse it. So we could try, like- I don't know, a different method. See if it turns off, and if not, just- Right.

[Referee (James)]
It sounds like you guys want to take a few precautions. That's certainly fine. You guys get the civilians out.

Both of the Fae have disappeared since being let out of their cages. Fuckers.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Pssh, that's just normal. Can- Can Maia climb up to the top of the tower on the outside, using her damp-based spider climb, and try and get into the top floor from- if there's like a window or anything?

[Referee (James)]
There are no- It doesn't look to have a window.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh. I see. Is the alarm still going off?

[Referee (James)]
At this point, it's probably been over an hour or so.

[Speaker 12]
What is the elevator made out of?

[(Dinaryse)]
Is it like metal? Or specifically the door?

[Referee (James)]
So the elevator is mostly made out of stone.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, I had stone shape the whole time. Yeah, I've also got stone shape.

[Referee (James)]
As far as- What is the door made out of? Is that what you asked?

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
The door to what, exactly?

[(Dinaryse)]
In the elevator. The top floor. So when we went up the top floor, what was the door?

[Referee (James)]
The top floor, I think it's also made out of this tower. So metal.

[Speaker 12]
Okay. Hmm.

[(Dinaryse)]
Is the tower itself made out of stone?

[Referee (James)]
No, I think it's mostly metal. There are stone bits, certainly, and it's connected to a section of stone. It's embedded into the side of this hole inside.

It goes deep into the earth.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I'm just wondering if it would be possible to use stone shape on that exterior wall to bore a hole into that top room.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know. You might be able to bend some of the metal inwards. That would be interesting.

[Speaker 12]
Hmm.

[Referee (James)]
Go ahead and make me a spell attack.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I just need to see in there and I can teleport in. Hmm.

[(Dinaryse)]
I just need a bit of sight. Where is my... I'll just cast a spell on...

Thirteen.

[Referee (James)]
Thirteen? Using the exterior doesn't... Most of the stone just kind of crumbles as it rubs up against...

As it rubs up against...

[Speaker 12]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Alright. The civilians have been secured with Sierra. Sierra is ready to basically take them to a safe location.

What would you folks like to do?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Well, I guess if the tower blows up, it'll hopefully break open the top room. If we've got a little more time.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, if we've got a little more time right now, I could try Shatter. As just trying to bring the whole roof down.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah. But yeah. Just shot.

I reckon.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah. Uh. I'll see the damage it does.

Actually, could I up-level this? I think I can. What do you guys use?

A little higher. One entire extra D8. Fourteen.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, I don't think it works terribly well. You just knock out another section of stone.

[(Dinaryse)]
This tower is too strong.

[Referee (James)]
You cannot handle my strongest towers. Adventure.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
But please. I guess we'll go. Maybe switching off the beam will help.

[Referee (James)]
Possibly.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Go unbeam the tower.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, so what do you guys have for the beam? What are you willing to try out?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um. I could try Dispelling Magic. Maybe.

Maybe? Why not? That's a good, yeah.

And I'm going to cast it at fourth level because that is the highest level slot I have.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, go ahead and make me a D20 roll plus your spell modifier.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
D20 plus my spell modifier? Okay. What is that?

[Referee (James)]
So, uh. Oh, sorry. Whatever your spellcasting ability modifier.

So wisdom. It would be your wisdom modifier.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay. So like a wisdom ability check? Would that work?

[Referee (James)]
It would just be straight wisdom.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, hang on. I can use my secondary class feature as you do that. I'm going to copy your spell.

Menstrual Bites.

[Referee (James)]
So that basically rebounds. Perry, you're going to take some damage I think. Okay.

You take nine damage. Nine necrotic damage. And then what was the result of your Menstrual Dice, Sahara?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I just need to look at the feature so I know how it works. I haven't used it in a while. No worries.

[Referee (James)]
I'm going to pull it up on my end as well.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I believe I can spend dice to attempt to capture it and then I can spend them to cast it. If the expended dice's total each equals ten plus the spell's level, you copy it and you can do the same to release it. So, it's a third level spell.

You're casting at a fourth level. I would need to get fourteen. I'm going to spend half my dice to try and catch it.

Alrighty. So, forty-eight. Fuck.

Never mind. Alright, I'm done.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty. So, what else do you folks have? Do you want to phone a friend with the hirelings?

Do you want to keep trying to hash this one out?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, let's get the mages that Jaster brought.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, the mage comes down along with the apprentice. Trying to teach them a lesson here. Ah, yes.

Well, we have a number of instruments here that could be used to redirect a charge to destroy the instruments themselves, but of course it might also backfire and cause the crystal to eject energy upwards or downwards or in pretty much any random direction before shutting off the instruments. It could theoretically turn the power down. Don't suppose you have anything that could move the crystal without actually touching it?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Not that I'm aware of. Indeed.

[(Dinaryse)]
I've got mage hands, but I think it will just be destroyed when it touches it.

[Referee (James)]
You would need something like this. The mage hand wouldn't be destroyed, but it couldn't lift something. Ah, yeah.

Basically, you would need something that could lift a five to ten foot object. Either lift it, or just...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Hmm. Anyone know telekinesis?

[Speaker 9]
Nope. Not me.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I don't think any animal, like conjured up animal, would survive long enough, unfortunately.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I could put a death ward on someone and they could just hit it real hard.

[(Dinaryse)]
Super just like golf putting out.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And it's not a creature.

[Referee (James)]
A creature for what?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, um... The cloak has an ability that if I cast magical darkness, I could make it do a charisma save, otherwise it's teleported to the world below.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, I see. It doesn't need teleport. Does it teleport to objects?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I think so? I think you can grab some.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, but I didn't use teleport, and I can only do it once a week.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Anything held or carried by them.

[Referee (James)]
Well, you can only do your free teleport once per week.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely within a ten foot cube.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
As reading that, that's just replacing one of the, um... Oh no, it's all or a single object within range.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, you could cast it to one of the...

[Morgan (Caleb)]
So it needs to be like everything people are carrying, or...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Or a single object. Well, yeah, but I used that one already, didn't I?

[Referee (James)]
Well, yes, but the ones that go to the teleportation circles are at will.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, and I can do that at will. Okay, I guess we could send this to a teleporting... Uh, which one do we want to send it to?

[Speaker 14]
Zybops's house?

[Speaker 12]
Roar! Yes, my dumping ground!

[Speaker 13]
I mean, is it like, once it's out of this thing, is it still dangerous?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, the mage thinks so. He's pretty confident about it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We could send it back to the tower itself. We have three options if we teleport circle teleport it out.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, do you want the thing that this crystal has been designed to target? Do you want Zybops... Do you want a heavily populated area like Sierra's keep?

Or do you want Zybops's apartment? Luxury penthouse. How is that even a question?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Or the coral place, because we put one down there.

[Speaker 8]
That's what I mean by the place it was designed to destroy.

[(Dinaryse)]
Ah. There'd be a nice decoration in a house, right?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The problem is, I would choose just his apartment if it wasn't in the middle of a town. A heavily populated town as well. Ah, semantics.

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I probably should just like, throw it in the shell house. Or the ocean, wherever it is.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Can I use my... My spider kunai can do like... They can do like a grappling strike at range.

Can I just use those to yank it out?

[Referee (James)]
Ah, it's pretty big. I don't think that... Okay.

You could attempt to destroy everything.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I don't want to destroy it. Destroying it's a bad idea, I feel. The bag of holding.

Okay. Can I just... Put it into the bag of holding?

How are you going to get it into the bag of holding? Teleport it... Teleport?

No, I don't know. I want the spicy loot room at the top. I'm stumped, I don't know...

What to do.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We got the major premise in, we still have the action in.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, let's just teleport it to the coral tower.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I don't care. I don't think it'll be that bad. I don't know how that could happen.

If it was made by an ancient fae, it should... It should hold up a little. Yeah, if that would have worked to break it, they would have done that in the first place.

Because the point of these is to break the... Yeah, I think to the coral tower is the play. It might not even explode when it gets teleported out.

I'm going to tell Ciara to get a high viewing point and watch in that vague direction. See if she just sees the mushroom cloud.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, I guess we'll teleport it to the coral tower.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty, the campaign ends and... Everything goes fine. Ciara gets a short missive later that says, Package received from the captain from House Freya.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Neat. Ah, we just gave it to them.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Alright, let's go regroup it. Let's teleport after it. Oh, does the building power down?

Can we go up to the top floor finally?

[Referee (James)]
We were always able to go up to the top floor, just... Can we go into it? So when you take the elevator back up, the door still has not opened.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Is there a way to use... The stairs only went up to the observatory, didn't they? Or was it one floor past there?

[Referee (James)]
One floor past that it went to another room that was closed that I believe you guys did not investigate.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
No.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I thought that one was locked too. Is this door not even locked?

[Referee (James)]
I don't think anybody tried to force it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We can try now.

[Referee (James)]
Is the door locked? So it's not... Somebody like Morgan is able to force it open pretty easily.

He doesn't have a handle. Please do, Morgan. Strong Morgan.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
I will, yeah, just fuckin' force it open. And if that doesn't work, it will be bear time. Do you want to check, or...? No, you're fine.

[Referee (James)]
Easy. It takes you maybe a couple of tries.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yep, easy done. So does this go up to the second top floor, or does this lead to the top floor? This is the...

[Referee (James)]
Well, which one are you guys... Are you guys on the elevator, or are you guys on the... I assume you guys were on the elevator and just forced it open the top floor.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Oh, we forced the top door? Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Yep. Cool. Neat.

It's like elevator doors where they part in the middle, it's just they didn't open.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, like in every video game. Morgan repeatedly pressing X. So what's in here?

[Referee (James)]
So there's a large table that looks to be used for meetings and organizations. There's a few vaults, two specifically in this room, one of which has been cleared out. It's still hanging open, there's like three gold pieces that have fallen out and been left behind.

There's also an officer's quarters up here. Looks like somebody... or maybe, sorry, a couple of...

Looks like five somebodies were up here and decided to split when shit started going down.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Fuckers. Was there... there was two vaults, did you say?

One of them was ransacked?

[Referee (James)]
Indeed.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Or both of them were. No, just one. And teleported, so it leaves everything else inside it.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know... I know what my answer is going to be depending on whether or not it's embedded in the wall. If this is under a 10, it's embedded in the wall.

If not, you guys can teleport it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Alright. Wait, no, under a 10 was embedded. That's...

good. Teleport the vault with not the treasure.

[Referee (James)]
It's going to contain the treasure, it's just going to... it's going to do something.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
It only targets one object, though.

[Referee (James)]
It's going to contain the...

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
The object is the vault. No.

[(Dinaryse)]
It'd be like teleporting someone, but their insides stay.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
People aren't objects, that's different. It specifies creatures, it specifies a single... No, I don't think so.

No, that's fine. Um, Meyer will crack that in a downtime, then, maybe.

[Referee (James)]
Why don't everybody make me a DC-18 Dexterity Saber?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Oh, no. Oh, no.

[(Dinaryse)]
More bombs.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
Last time this happened, I fucking died. Ayy, we made it. Hell yeah.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Alright, Cianna. Cianna, you better make it. Cianna!

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh, it's not rolling. Oh, I know, I need to press extra buttons. 18!

[Referee (James)]
Yes! Let's go! Alright, you guys take, uh...

19 damage as opposed to 38. Because we've still got that, uh... Let's just lay tap out.

As a glyph of warning goes off. Yeah, actually, from inside this particular... Inside this command area, you guys can actually see to the outside.

It's like a one-way mirror.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Huh. Oh, fuck you.

[Referee (James)]
Alright, I'm gonna go use the restroom. You guys tell me what your next course of action is. I think...

Or get ready for your next course of action when I get back.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I think we can get the civilians back into the building. I think Sierra can stay here and watch over this place. And the rest of us go back to the center.

And we can see if this has had an effect on the locked doors that were inside the cave. Oh, true, actually.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There were still two more towers, weren't there?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yes, there's still two more beams. But if it's opened the treasure door, then we can just stop there and not worry about the rest, because that's all Maya wants to do. And Zaivatsu's pretty late to the session.

[Speaker 12]
Yes, late.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
It would be so easy for him to just die.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So I was joking about putting the thing in his apartment.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We should have made him whole. Well, he's not in his apartment, so...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, I was hoping it would be a speak of the devil moment.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Yeah, I think we... We can... Yeah, I think we get the chefs back in the tower.

We get the human to just hang out here for a hot minute while we sort the rest of our shit out. We can head back to the center and check out the caves and the locked doors and probably... I don't know, actually, what we do after that.

I guess if they're unlocked, it changes everything.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was thinking about it. I think we did tell those guys to go to Corrigan. Like, I don't think we gave them addresses, but I think we told them to go to Esheros with Corrigan.

The criminals. Did we?

[Speaker 14]
I vaguely remember something like that. I feel like we felt bad because they kept begging. And we were like, yeah, just send them to Corrigan.

You can always use people, right?

[Morgan (Caleb)]
We felt bad is a big statement. I know I didn't feel bad.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Somebody felt bad and let them go to Corrigan. I don't remember who. Did she?

I don't remember if you offered them jobs. Why? Or just the two mooks.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
No, it was one good. No, there were two. Because one was fucked out because he almost drowned.

Oh no, but I resurrected him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We saved him, but he was out like a light.

Oh yeah. And his boss was dead as shit. Yeah.

Fucking, like, short and raised to his chest.

[(Dinaryse)]
The other guy just took the boat. And he's like, get out of here, bozo. Go get a job.

[Speaker 6]
Alrighty, folks. What are you up to now?

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
We, well, I would like to get the chefs back in the building. And the human can hang out for a bit. Sierra can wait here with those guys.

While we teleport Coral Spire with the, with like transport dragons as well. And I would like to go check out in the cave where the heartbeat was and the locked doors to see if they have, any of those have unlocked with the pillars, with the beams being taken out.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, they have. Alrighty. Let me look at my...

Treasure room. Treasure room. Can't look here because the treasure room, well, two treasure rooms.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Not the one with water, just the one with loot.

[Referee (James)]
They all have water in them. But as you step up the, as you move up the steps of this particular Coral Spire, you find that a lot of the life and color is actually returned to it, even immediately. There are more creatures around, critters that resemble normal natural animals, but composed in some way of coral.

Maybe sometimes having a little bit more... You can see a few, one or two. As you enter the main hallway, you notice that one or two flamingo, creatures that look like flamingos, very scarlet red, composed of coral, and included the ability to fly, as you can see, have moved into, have moved into this main hall.

They are very large, like MOA size, but they appear to be friendly to you, even as they look extraordinarily dangerous. You catch up with the... Actually, you know what?

No, the other guys have not made it back to base yet.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Wait, so the crystal was just sitting there when we got back? Yep.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, the Coral Spire is not just fine, better than fine. It looks to be healing already from whatever damage was dealt to it.

[Speaker 12]
Two... Oops.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so one of the doors that opened was, in fact, to the treasure room. There's a large... ...hole here, along with a few other items. Gonna probably roll them up randomly over the course of our downtime. Guess I'll provide that. Sure.

And the second door that opened, you can smell a little bit of seawater that spilled out, but it seems to have since been absorbed by the coral. The second door that opened was the one that held a boat. If you look in, it's still...

The boat is still in there. It's kind of hovered. Looks very small.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't think I have identified. I do not have identified. Does Zianna have Identify at all?

[(Dinaryse)]
I might have it as a ritual, yes. Oh no, it's just innate. Boom.

One minute.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty. So what are you folks up to? If you'd like, we could end the session here.

You guys can finish up the remainder of your stuff in downtime. I think it's pretty good. You guys accomplished quite a bit in this session, I'd say.

[Morgan (Caleb)]
A little bit done. Lots of murder. These lay tabs have been going really...

So far, these lay tabs have all been really good. Except for the part where one killed me. But that's okay.

That's just sort of par for the course, really. I did want to end it.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
How hard is it to crack the safe?

[Referee (James)]
I wouldn't say it's terribly hard. The hard part, realistically speaking, was just getting to it. Yeah, okay.

[(Dinaryse)]
I don't want to identify the thing as well.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you have identified? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

So this is the dream of dreaming. It's an artifact. It's a vessel that will turn into a rather large airship that can be piloted and moved around.

It can only be... But it can only do so in the twilight hours at night. Or...

It can't be... Basically, if you're in the material plane, it can't be flown during the day. If sunlight does catch it, it will sink relatively safely to the ground.

Or it will teleport into the... Sorry. Translate into the daylight.

[Speaker 12]
Oh.

[(Dinaryse)]
Oh. Interesting. Miracle.

[Referee (James)]
Is this one of the elven artifacts that... Hera?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was part of the group, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Very nice.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, we got told about it from the... Princess lady? That we rescued a while back?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, the princess that you guys rescued.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
That's the one Zaibatsu was upset about missing.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Airship is always useful, though. Even if it can only be ridden at night.

[Referee (James)]
Absolutely.

[(Dinaryse)]
Or if there's a way to, like, create a web of darkness around it. Then... Just get a very big umbrella.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
I do have the spell darkness. I don't think it'll be big enough, though. Or just...

[(Dinaryse)]
Yeah, I wonder if there's... Something that could encompass the ship.

[Referee (James)]
Alrighty, folks. Well, I will be contacting you about downtime actions. And in the meantime, the spire will probably get assaulted by the remaining two outposts.

I'm just gonna run a mass combat in the downtime. And see what happens.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Sick. Excellent session. I will provide you folks with experience over the evening.

Or over the next couple of days. I'll figure out a time to do it. And...

And we will be good to go.

[Sierra, Maia (Landie)]
Thank you. Thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Thanks as always for playing. And I'll see you folks later. Awesome, thank you for running.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Absolutely. Peace.

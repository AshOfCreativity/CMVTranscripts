[Speaker 5]
I'm not going to be able to- I was thinking Quicksilver.

[Speaker 1]
Quicksilver, ah yes.

[Speaker 6]
Awful.

[Speaker 4]
The one that added a white liquid.

[Speaker 1]
He said it was like white chocolate.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'll bite into a bar of white chocolate and think, hmm, refrigerated gum.

[Speaker 4]
That's- You don't know that.

[Speaker 1]
I don't like the milk chocolate cookies. Can I get the macadamia gum?

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
That's not how that works. Alright, coming into a room that does not smell like gum. Stop!

[Speaker 2]
You just walked right into that one.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We've opened the door to dick jokes. It's going to be hard to close it.

[Speaker 6]
It's okay.

[Speaker 1]
It does not smell like Lorraine. There are some instruction manuals nearby written in sylvan, it looks like. And it looks like the place was recently abandoned.

Outside, there is a cacophony as the tidal wave of- As a tidal wave of like baby toys and newborn furniture comes sweeping by the building, it rumbles like back over and almost like rolls backwards into itself. And you see the form of what looks to be like a rather large baby. A two-story tall baby currently outside the window, trying to look for some entry point.

[Speaker 3]
Can it get in?

[Speaker 2]
Can it fit into the fucking door? I would assume it can change shape somewhat? Like squish itself?

Uh, it doesn't appear to know how to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Like there are open windows and stuff like that. That's so disturbing. It's just like beating against the fucking wall at the moment.

I hope it doesn't knock the building down.

[Speaker 2]
Kairona, who is probably still firing out the window at this point, just yells at it, Go away!

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I'm sure being a baby it understands what you're saying.

[Speaker 1]
Your bow at the moment is excitedly commenting on how this is by far the creepiest situation you've ever thrown it into.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I totally forgot those guys were there.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, this is the sentient bow. The major parentheses are yelling.

[Speaker 2]
I forgot those guys were there. I feel like they're probably so freaked out they're crying, but my bow is just like this is totally unique. Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to get totally unique experiences these days?

[Speaker 1]
I'm a fan of totally unique. I don't like the sound of crying baby.

[Speaker 2]
For real though. Nobody does, dude. Get over it.

[Speaker 3]
Maybe we could soothe it?

[Speaker 4]
Can anyone play an instrument?

[Speaker 1]
Jimmy says Give it milk!

[Speaker 5]
Can I have pararole insight to see if there's a way to maybe soothe the baby?

[Speaker 2]
Sure thing. Sure, go on down there and rock it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, let's see here. There are two glowing spots in the sockets that are supposed to hold eyes. There's the shape of sockets in this thing's face, and at the back of each socket is a slight glow.

The more you concentrate, the more you strip away the glamour that's giving this thing a slightly more baby-like form. One of the objects is a bottle and the other one is a little... it looks like a harmonica.

No, it looks like a little... not kaleidoscope. A...

xylophone. No, xylophone.

[Speaker 5]
Did we ever spot any of those in the pile of things?

[Speaker 1]
Sure, there are many of them composing the baby right now.

[Speaker 3]
We need to find the actual ones.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it's a baby made of things?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. All the things are in the shape of a baby taking form.

[Speaker 1]
There's a little bit of an additional glamour that makes it look more like a baby that has no eyes to where the... like I said, it's monochromatic. The black and white blends together for more of an authentic baby-like form.

You've been concentrating on it for the past minute or so to look past that.

[Speaker 2]
If it's been a minute, I'm going to roll another 10 Eldritch Blasts because this is how I deal with problems. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to put its mouth up to the window. I need everybody in here to make me strength-saving throws. Oh, don't puke.

He's absolutely puking.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm bad at this.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, 4.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, those of you who got below a 16 are going to take 21 bludgeoning damage. Save for half.

[Speaker 4]
Is that everyone but me?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, are you the only one that failed?

[Speaker 4]
Um, no, no, I did. Okay, you guys got 16s. So Kyroto's the only one that failed?

[Speaker 1]
My guess is Kyroto popped up to send another volley out and there was just baby mouth. The cauldron has spilled over.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, our white liquids. No, um, I'm going to stick my hand in it. What's in the depths of that cauldron?

You know. Um, it's, no, cum is on the inside of the body, there's no dick waiting in the middle of that. At least that's where I'm going.

[Speaker 1]
It's like milk, but probably alcoholic.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. That's weird.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, maybe if I keep firing at it and it comes up to puke again, we'll throw that in its mouth.

[Speaker 1]
What do you think? Not anymore, because now it's spilled out.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, damn.

[Speaker 4]
Um, what's it taste like?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, you taste it. I don't know if I would get that after a baby has puked in here, because that's definitely mixing in there.

[Speaker 1]
Well, the puke wasn't like puke, it was like baby toys.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'll get like a baby teacup.

[Speaker 4]
Actually no, I'm just going to lick it like a cat would lick it on the ground. Oh dear, just cup your hands, please.

[Speaker 2]
Wash your hands, please.

[Speaker 3]
It's too late. Not ideal, but okay.

[Speaker 1]
It tastes like milk mixed with an amaretto. Like an almond whiskey.

[Speaker 4]
And now I get the baby teacup.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, the door opens and you see one of those sylvan or elf-looking critters that you saw earlier. What the hell is going on in here? Speaking in sylvan.

What the hell is going on in here? It takes in the scene and just slams the door shut.

[Speaker 2]
It is fairly obvious. It is fairly obvious what is going on here.

[Speaker 3]
I'm glad you think it's good. Don't drink too much.

[Speaker 2]
Somebody want to chase after him and ask if he's got more milk?

[Speaker 3]
Sure. I'll chase after him. Is he running?

[Speaker 1]
He is running, yeah. We're going to do a little skill challenge here.

[Speaker 5]
Can I do something silly, maybe?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 5]
Can I just teleport in front of him? With everyone?

[Speaker 3]
With everyone?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that'll bypass it. You can see it. There's this elaborate miniature maze of broken beams and supports and white shingles that have fallen down and little traps that he's just barely setting off and maybe sometimes throwing behind him.

You all just teleport right in front of him.

[Speaker 4]
He's looking behind him and just runs into us.

[Speaker 3]
Punch him in the face.

[Speaker 4]
Knock him back. Put my hand out and he runs into it?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, callsign him. Pretty much. Hello.

I have a question. Is that the first time you've seen that creature?

[Speaker 1]
What language are you saying this in?

[Speaker 3]
Ancient Common. She doesn't speak Sylvan, I forgot.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Surface Commoner. Hello.

What was your question again?

[Speaker 3]
I was just... First off, it's Mimosa. Do not call me Surface Dweller.

Surface Commoner. Secondly, is that the first time that thing has been active?

[Speaker 1]
It's a recent addition to our fair twirling.

[Speaker 3]
Which means we set it off at least? Where's the bottle? Where's the xylophone?

Who are you? What are you doing here?

[Speaker 1]
Look at who's so observant. I was hoping to go inside the manor house and find it myself, but as you can see, you folks are in somewhat of a more exposed portion of the apartment buildings. They're more dilapidated, and the baby is making progress inwards.

[Speaker 2]
If I can see it, I am still firing at it.

[Speaker 3]
You know how to get to the manor?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think there's a way past this thing.

[Speaker 4]
Do we have to kill it?

[Speaker 1]
No, I was hoping to subdue it!

[Speaker 3]
If there's a way to subdue it and get what we need, that's the better option.

[Speaker 1]
It's about to vomit again. Does anybody have anything they want to do?

[Speaker 2]
Take cover?

[Speaker 4]
Run for cover? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. You guys don't have to make any saves or something like that. They're just a bunch of, you know, ball pit balls.

[Speaker 4]
Weird action figures thrown at us.

[Speaker 1]
It's kind of like erupt in a wave and then slowly slide down.

[Speaker 4]
Have you ever had a toy thrown at you by a child? They have superhuman strength.

[Speaker 3]
Their aim is impeccable. She's got me between the eyes. Oh no.

[Speaker 4]
I was never so good.

[Speaker 3]
She pegged me between the eyes.

[Speaker 1]
Had eye shots with a Nerf gun. And when I was in my single digit years. Your new friend is like, what are you doing?

Let me out! Please!

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to be here! Well, neither do we, buddy. You clearly want to be here!

Does this thing look hurt at all, or is it not taking any damage? It looks roughed up a little bit. It looks like it might be regenerating.

[Speaker 4]
Are these toys flammable?

[Speaker 5]
What if we try and send our new friend to distract it while we go into the manor?

[Speaker 2]
He definitely didn't sign up for that. That's not fair.

[Speaker 5]
Well, it's also not fair to just kill, you know, this thing.

[Speaker 3]
It didn't sign up to be here.

[Speaker 4]
Neither did I.

[Speaker 3]
No, I think you did. You definitely did. The point is, we need to try not to sacrifice anything, or kill probably the tortured ghost of that.

Usually if you attack a tortured ghost, you make it worse. So let's just try to find the objects that we need to find.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have anything to soothe it with? I mean, you're mostly two young boys that you have, I assume, for nefarious purposes over there.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, absolutely. Let's throw the young boys at it.

[Speaker 3]
I don't feel like that's fair to them. They wouldn't stand a chance. They wouldn't stand a chance.

They're not that advanced.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone have good charisma?

[Speaker 3]
I do.

[Speaker 2]
But unfortunately, I've been using it to beat it up.

[Speaker 3]
I do. I mean, I've got a plus three.

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, I also have a plus three, because I was thinking, using performance and singing a lullaby. I have a plus five.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I can mother it with intimidation.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yes! That's a plus eleven!

[Speaker 5]
Bad baby.

[Speaker 4]
Go back to your room. Use the mom voice. Do it.

[Speaker 3]
It's worth a try. I don't feel like it would work as low as we are. I would want her to be high face height.

[Speaker 5]
Faced baby. I could also enhance your ability for it. And then you have advantage.

Um... Yeah, I think... Okay, so we teleported in front of this guy.

We're in the streets?

[Speaker 1]
No, you're in an apartment complex. It's just a more run down location. Like, the roof is caved in and stuff like that.

So you are closer to the manor house now.

[Speaker 3]
Why don't we just sprint? Yeah, that was kind of my thought. I like her idea!

Alright. You. She points to the guy who's been here the whole time.

You lead the way. No funny business. Oh, five by me?

[Speaker 1]
I only have to run faster than you? Oh, he starts sprinting. He takes off, doesn't he?

He's sprinting for the manor house.

[Speaker 3]
That's where he wanted to go originally, so it's pretty much the same goal.

[Speaker 1]
He never wanted to go alone!

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. He at least would know how to get in, so we don't have to figure that out.

[Speaker 1]
This time, we will have a skill challenge. Oh boy. Skill challenges are going to be for things like, first up, there's going to be getting around obstacles.

Second, for outpacing the baby. Third, well, we'll do those two first, and then there will be two after that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so if any of us fails, we're going to trip those two guys, okay? I bet. What's the first roll?

[Speaker 2]
What's up first?

[Speaker 4]
Actually, we can't trip them and leave them behind, because one of my bonds says otherwise.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it was a joke!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the joke just in case. So, it's whatever you want to do for overcoming obstacles first. Something that either you can do or use to help your party get through quickly.

[Speaker 5]
Can I use Perception to see where the least amount of resistance would be?

[Speaker 1]
I feel like Perception might actually be bad here, because you're distinctly smaller than most of your other party. Guys, go this way, and then Keebee gets stuck behind.

[Speaker 2]
Could I do it, since I'm the size of most of the party? Sure. Undo what now?

[Speaker 5]
Perception.

[Speaker 2]
Just see where the best path is. I rolled with advantage from my familiar.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, so you see that there is a relatively clearer path through the balconies on the outside edge of these buildings. It does bring you closer to the baby, but it allows you to bypass a lot of the fallen rubble that might otherwise impede your progress.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I don't know if height really matters, since crushed or swiped off is going to be the same. So we should do the balconies. That gives us a better chance.

[Speaker 4]
Good with me. I'm basically a cat.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Trying to find a way to use my sleight of hand. That gives me a plus 12.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the second one is keeping pace against the baby, which is crashing up against buildings. It's like winding up. It's like getting parallel with you guys, winding up, and then crashing into the building, which is very inefficient for actually hitting you guys, but if you don't keep up or avoid losing your footing, you're going to get um squashed.

[Speaker 4]
So what kind of check is that?

[Speaker 1]
What indeed?

[Speaker 3]
Like dexterity?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I would think so.

[Speaker 3]
Acrobatics?

[Speaker 1]
Probably something like that. This will be one that everybody makes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'm not particularly good at anything but swinging my axe, so anything works.

[Speaker 2]
Ability or saving throw? If we do flat dexterity. Either one.

[Speaker 3]
I'm in a... Damn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, who got the lowest? Oh no, Kyroda!

[Speaker 5]
Kibi also has... There's Kibi.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no! Oh jeez. I went down by four until it went down by two.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say that Kibi looks behind to see that both Arthur and Jimmy are falling behind. It goes back to help them and trips and like gets swept up by a big baby hand which is now holding Kibi and during its pursuit of the rest of the party. Kibi, I need you to make me a wisdom save while you're hanging out here.

[Speaker 4]
Wisdom save. Let's see how wise Kibi is. Kibi's not wise, you guys.

Kibi doesn't know what the fuck's going on.

[Speaker 3]
That's the flaw of barbarians.

[Speaker 1]
They're so susceptible to stuff. Entranced at the moment by the sound of all the rattling and little musical toys going off all at once.

[Speaker 4]
Her eyes get big when you see a cat's eyes get really big.

[Speaker 3]
Just like that. I will try I guess since we're up higher I'll try to do the mothering.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so this next stage we'll be seeing if you could get Kibi out of this mess.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Mimosa would skid to a halt and call the baby and be like, um, excuse me, no thank you! Set it down, please! Set her down!

Look at me! Set the kitty down! Right now!

You're petting it too rough. You need to be gentle. Set it down.

[Speaker 2]
Can I try too?

[Speaker 1]
I think with the fifth team what's going to happen is the baby is going to throw Kibi at Mimosa.

[Speaker 4]
Mid-purr. I'm purring and just looking just entranced and all of a sudden yeet.

[Speaker 3]
Are we?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. First I'm going to roll to see if I get that.

[Speaker 3]
There's a strangled. Thank you! Good job!

Oh!

[Speaker 1]
That misses Mimosa but it's still good.

[Speaker 4]
Can I land on my feet?

[Speaker 1]
I think you're flamboyant when this happens. Boy. We'll say you smack into a wall which wakes you from the, we'll say the charmed effect and then you slide down landing on your feet next to the um, roughly next to Mimosa.

Maybe three are a little high.

[Speaker 3]
Just be like, thank you! Duh!

[Speaker 1]
You all are nearly to the Mimosa.

[Speaker 3]
Pull. Kibi's like, let's go. Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
She gets up and runs. She can lick her wounds later. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Literally. Oh!

[Speaker 4]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
I'll be right back.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the last stage is going to be you folks looking for a entry to the manor house since you're getting rather close to it.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so that's perception.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that'll be fine.

[Speaker 4]
Um, yeah, I will also roll. How did we get exactly the same? What is wrong with me today, man?

You know what, she just got hit in the head. It's excusable.

[Speaker 1]
Her eyes are looking in different directions right now.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so Para and Kyrona are both agreed that the front door actually looks pretty good. You'll exit the you'll run down like a set of basically fire escape stairs, more or less towards the front end of the manor house. A lot of the balls and furnishings have been have sort of swept away like the tide of a tsunami or the tide right before a tsunami has actually drawn a lot of them away and out into the street so you don't have to like get mired or so you don't have to climb over it.

However, walking through you're like tripping off him and stuff like that and the baby is almost upon y'all.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if closing the door behind us will actually be of any help. I'm gonna hail Mary a turn undead. I don't know if it's actually undead, but I mean I don't think it's gonna be undead.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it also has to be within 30 feet of me.

[Speaker 1]
So the Wait, wait, did you say turn undead?

[Speaker 5]
I was thinking about it, yeah. Okay. But I didn't know if it was close enough for that.

[Speaker 1]
I'd say, well, it's approaching you, so it will definitely get close enough. Oh, that's fair. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
So, yeah, when it's within 30 feet, I will try it. Will it work? Who knows?

[Speaker 4]
But, I mean It'd be pretty sick if it does.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. You all see a ghostly form get kicked out of the metaphorically speaking, out of the giant baby made of baby toys before fading, and the pile comes to a rest.

[Speaker 4]
Keebee's cheering.

[Speaker 1]
Now the sound of crying grows further and further away, at least for this grief-refergive.

[Speaker 4]
Do we get a good look at the figure?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Go ahead and make me a, um Hey, what? Make me somebody What do I think?

I think medicine check is gonna be this one. Medicine or history? Whichever one you all prefer.

[Speaker 4]
I'm shit at both, so let's do it. God, I can't get any. I'm only getting single digits.

[Speaker 1]
What is going on? You're like, that is definitely a baby right there.

[Speaker 5]
So, I will admit, one of the things I do is if I'm rolling low, I just refresh foundry. Maybe it's a superstitious thing, but I mean, it feels like it sometimes works. You know what?

I think it's funny. It's like changing your dice. I think it's funny to keep failing.

I would keep it.

[Speaker 1]
So, let's see here.

[Speaker 5]
If only my players were like that.

[Speaker 1]
And Kyrona, I think also will notice One, is very clearly an elf baby. How could you tell?

[Speaker 4]
Pointy ears.

[Speaker 1]
That was the easy part. Second, it is an underdeveloped elf baby.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no!

[Speaker 1]
Elves are pointier in the womb, and they grow less pointy as time goes on.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that was weird to walk in on.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I kind of figured it was going to be like that. I'm really confused.

[Speaker 3]
Me too. I just got back.

[Speaker 5]
Isn't the queen pregnant?

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god. She is.

[Speaker 5]
It would make sense that there's a new entity if the queen's pregnant and this is the new entity. But I don't know how these things work. Me neither.

[Speaker 3]
What are we talking about?

[Speaker 5]
I turned on dad the baby. What did that do? It sent the baby out.

Oh, okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
The whole thing crumbled because the ghost was yeeted out of it. Apparently it looks like a cone-shaped elven fetus.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. So by underdeveloped you meant it's not ready to be born yet. I thought you meant like malnourished or something.

Oh, there, there.

[Speaker 1]
I understand the confusion now, though. In the meantime, y'all hear the door shut behind you. And a little bit of silly giggling laughter of the sylvan variety.

A special kind that just seems to echo and hang in the air to tease you a second time the more you focus on it.

[Speaker 4]
How creepy and gothic is this place?

[Speaker 1]
I'd say yes. Sort of. It's not human.

It's not built to be super intimidating. It's built to look a little bit more artistic.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um, what do we see in like the area?

[Speaker 1]
Well, at the moment you see a closed manor house.

[Speaker 2]
Was that laugh from- was that laugh from the guy that was running with us or what? Oh, okay. That's fine, dude.

That's pretty fair.

[Speaker 4]
Why'd he giggle, though? That's weirdo. What's he laughing at?

You know what? Maybe he's ecstatic that he's just gotten away from death. That's what I'm gonna go with.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Why not?

[Speaker 1]
He's just a silly little guy. With a whimsy and mischief.

[Speaker 2]
Whatever, dude. Alright, shall we? How well banished is that baby?

Is it gonna come back and reanimate the thing? I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
Thanks.

[Speaker 1]
Super helpful. Y'all can't see it at the moment is the primary issue.

[Speaker 5]
Usually it only lasts like a minute.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, y'all got a minute to figure out a solution.

[Speaker 2]
Let's go find those two things. The xylophone and the something.

[Speaker 5]
Good idea. So let's find a kitchen first.

[Speaker 1]
There's a problem. You guys can't get into the manor.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I thought we were inside the manor.

[Speaker 4]
Nope. How about the windows?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Also, is the front door made of wood?

[Speaker 1]
It's made of the same material that all this place is.

[Speaker 4]
Which is like a weird slate type of stuff, right?

[Speaker 1]
It looks like wood, but a little bit more spongy.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so would my axe go into it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. That's totally not a weird descriptor at all. Wood, but more spongy.

Yeah. Like cork?

[Speaker 1]
A little bit spongier.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so my axe will go in. Okay, where's the front door? Because that's where I'm gonna bring my axe.

I'm gonna try to open it first. And when that doesn't work. Or, if it does work, then I'll just go inside.

[Speaker 2]
I'll say it works. Look at you, solving problems with axes.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. Kibi, as you break into this door and cut through it, you notice that the wood is bleeding. Or the door is bleeding after you hit it.

[Speaker 4]
What does it smell like?

[Speaker 1]
Smells like blood.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so it's not like a... Okay. Well, my blood...

My axe is not really... It's made to get bloody, so I'm just gonna kick the door down.

[Speaker 1]
Your worst is to get an axe. I don't know what those would be, but blood's probably not one of them. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, let's spread out. Half of us look for the kitchen and half of us look for the nursery.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'll take the nursery. I'll take the kitchen.

[Speaker 2]
I'll go with...

[Speaker 5]
Where did Kyrona say she was going?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I was going to hunt nursery.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Then I will go with Kibi. And we get one boy each.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take the less sniveling one.

[Speaker 1]
I want Jimothy. Alright, so you get Jimby then. Alright, so kitchen and the nursery.

Going to the kitchen, which is closer. We're going to handle that first. You get in and it looks...

Alright, we're going to start with the colors. Everything on the interior of this looks relatively monochrome. However, once you step into a room, aside from the foyer, it suddenly regains its...

it regains a little bit of life and color into it. So you step into the kitchen and it looks like... it does not look like a drow house by any stretch of the imagination.

It looks like a... It looks like the kitchen that you would see in the Banyan Cairn. It looks like either the mess hall, or it has the same motifs as the mess hall in the guards' home in the Banyan Cairn.

And you've probably been to the dining hall inside the palace at least once. Like you would have passed through it or seen it.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. This looks familiar.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. All the food on the plates looks chewed or minced. You can smell things like...

Oh! That smells like carrot cake. That smells like...

That smells like mead. That smells like wine. That looks like...

Um... That smells like dumplings. And stuff like that.

But they're all like chewed up. There's like bowls of just like ramen that's been chewed up and etc, etc.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm. Is it moldy?

[Speaker 1]
Nope. It looks fresh.

[Speaker 2]
Is it warm? Interesting.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so. Warm enough to smell.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
That's definitely different than the Feywild, right? I don't think we're in the Feywild.

[Speaker 4]
We're in the Underdark.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know. If I send someone to the Underdark, they'll come just here.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Looking around, do I see a baby bottle?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
I don't feel like it'd be that easy. Is there a baby bottle in this one? No, you do not.

[Speaker 4]
Is there a dishwasher I could look in? Hmm. Or a microwave, or like, you know, something.

[Speaker 1]
A bottle warmer. The bottle hasn't been used yet. As you guys are looking, you see little bits of the plates suddenly disappear one by one, or the content of the meals inside the plates disappear one by one, as if time was taking little bites out of them.

[Speaker 4]
Hmm. Someone's enjoying a nice meal.

[Speaker 1]
You'll see the king sitting at the table alone. Again, monochromatic. Just looking sad and dejected.

And then you see another version of him with his daughter. And he's looking pretty sad, but it looks like they're holding it together. Both of them look sad, but it looks like they're holding it together.

You see another one with him, the queen's sister, and the daughter, and they all look pretty happy. You see another one with him, the queen, and his daughter. And again, they look happy.

And then him, the queen, and but this time the queen is pregnant. And she looks happiest, but he looks a little depressed.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm. Um.

[Speaker 4]
If I knock over one of the plates off the table, will it bounce back?

[Speaker 1]
Which scene would you say, because it's flipping back and forth between all of these, which scene do you think you're doing this between?

[Speaker 4]
Um, I want to do this to the pregnant lady one. Because, you know, fuck her and her baby.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, when it's just her and the king, but she's pregnant?

[Speaker 3]
Um. Yeah. I'm going to interrupt there.

That was really enthusiastic.

[Speaker 1]
She's unsure, okay.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, just knock the plate off, you know?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was just, alright, so you knock the plate off. The room becomes a little bit more real at this point, where you can see the king now has a little bit more color to his face, as does the queen. He's mouthing words angrily and shouting.

It looks like they can actually see you now.

[Speaker 4]
How wonderful! Can I see anybody else that isn't the king and his wife? Nope.

[Speaker 5]
Of course.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that might not have been. Can they see me?

[Speaker 1]
They can see you.

[Speaker 3]
And they're mad. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
She's in the middle of, like, offering him a offering him a drink.

[Speaker 4]
I'll just pick up the plate and put it back and hop off the table and, you know, go away.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, it goes back to flipping through a few different scenes.

[Speaker 3]
I should have, like, stolen some food with you, like, your cat.

[Speaker 4]
You know what? Fuck it. Yeah, that's what I did.

I took a bread roll. Actually, there's no bread roll. It's all, yeah, it's all just gummed up.

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, when you knocked the thing off, the food returned to, like, being normal.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well then, yeah, I'll take, like, a bread roll if there's one. Or, like, a chicken leg or something.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it disappears when you put the thing back.

[Speaker 4]
Ah. Well, did they see that? Because that was pretty crazy.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe we could talk to each Well, we couldn't hear what they were saying.

[Speaker 1]
I think y'all have Jimmy, so Jimmy's like, uh, it looks like he was malling for the guards and, like, who are you?

[Speaker 4]
That would make sense.

[Speaker 1]
Stay away from my wife.

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Do you have to knock the plate off to get them like that, or...

[Speaker 4]
Maybe you just have to interact with them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, oh, you shouldn't eat that, If you want to. Make the chicken.

[Speaker 5]
No, Kibi wasn't with us when we went to get the dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Are the scenes still cycling?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, they are. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Can I give a suggestion, even though I'm not there?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. Illegal.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if you're being serious or not.

[Speaker 1]
I am. But I am going to switch to the nursery crew in just a moment here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Right. So... Yeah.

Uh... I think we need to interact with them to see what's going on. I don't know.

Does anybody have any ideas for talking to them?

[Speaker 5]
Oh god, I'm not smart. Um... I hit things with my axe, man.

I... Um... Yeah, go with the other two for a moment and give us a bit to think.

Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Good idea.

[Speaker 1]
In the meantime, the nursery crew goes up the stairs and they can hear the... Um... Let's see here.

They can hear the fey creature that you met earlier rummaging about behind the door.

[Speaker 6]
Ooh.

[Speaker 1]
It appears to be locked or blocked by something.

[Speaker 2]
So, um, it's Corona and Mimosa?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. And Arthur.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Um, Mimosa, do you want to try and pick it? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go for it.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see. Oh, I have to go to the inventory, right?

[Speaker 1]
I had 17 success, yeah. Super simple. You open it up.

Push aside a chair that was improperly propped up against the door.

[Speaker 3]
What is the room? What do we see? Alright, so...

Cool.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. So, you'll see a fractured, shattered-looking plane of existence. Um, this room has bits and pieces, little islands of what's supposed to be the building.

But there is no indication that this is, like, inside of a wider building besides those. Like, it just expands into gray skies, a tempest, and oblivion beyond that, where your mind just doesn't even register the sense of there being objects or depth perception if you stare out too long across the horizon. There's just, like, these islands, as I said, of this room.

They're connected by oversized, stuffed animals, little bits of cradles that are large enough to act as bridges, and at the very far end, there is what looks to be a rather large cradle of something about the size of a wagon and a baby crying within.

[Speaker 2]
And you can see a fake creature trying to make his way across Who's gonna do kind of the loud How is he struggling to make his way across?

[Speaker 1]
So y'all can't hear it or feel it from your current position, but he's swaying back and forth like he's being buffeted by wind.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
He's just, like, he's, like, down on all fours, pretty much, and, like, straddling to make sure he doesn't fall off.

[Speaker 2]
You said that there were islands? Yeah. Connected by stuffed animals.

[Speaker 1]
What do the islands look like? Just bits and bobs, like, here's one with a large, like, oversized chair. There's another one with an oversized teddy bear on top of it.

It looks like you kind of look like you're in a scene from Toy Story at the moment. If Toy Story was undergoing some kind of, like, eldritch horror that was siphoning away reality.

[Speaker 3]
Toy Story is an eldritch horror.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. A little bit, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Is there Is the dude just walking normally through the stuff, like, trying to walk normally, like he's not on the islands?

[Speaker 1]
Right now he's on one of the bridges going across. He's struggling a lot.

[Speaker 2]
Is there anything to kind of indicate a correct order to go across the islands? No, no.

[Speaker 1]
There's just a path on the left that appears to be closest to it. Give me a quick perception or investigation check.

[Speaker 2]
Can I have my familiar give me advantage?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. All right. Mimosa, you first.

You can see that there is a the path that the what's-his-face is on appears to have a small, like, regular human-sized xylophone on it. It looks like he's intentionally going the long way around to get to it. Let's see here.

Skylar points out to Chirona a little red glow on the other side and tells him to, like, hey, like, concentrate on that point. There's a red glow there. You're not going to think there is at first, but concentrate on it.

And sure enough, after a minute or so, you do know or less than a minute, sorry, after a couple of seconds, you do notice what appears to be a normal-sized it's a thick crap, it's a big bottle. There we go. Plus a word.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a smaller xylophone around?

[Speaker 1]
What do you mean smaller? Smaller than, like, human-sized?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like, is there a baby-sized one?

[Speaker 1]
That's sort of what I meant.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
I wasn't sure if he was, like, going for the wrong one. Oh, no, I understand now. No, I should have clarified.

It's like the size that you would give to a, um... It's a baby toy, right? It's not the full-sized instrument.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the small xylophone. What was in the red dot? The red light?

[Speaker 1]
There's a baby bottle.

[Speaker 3]
I say we go for the baby bottle.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's no sense following him.

[Speaker 3]
So... Five gold if he falls off? Um...

Sure, why not. Five gold if he falls off a bridge. Okay.

We go for the bottle.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. So I'll run up. As soon as you enter the room, you get this howling, scream, this cacophony of wind that feels like hot and breathy.

Like the screams that appear in the back are literally the screams of a baby that are threatening to push you around off these islands.

[Speaker 2]
Does it smell like milk?

[Speaker 1]
Um...

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't really smell like anything in here. I don't want it to be baby breath.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's not baby breath.

[Speaker 3]
Too soon.

[Speaker 1]
Smell is one of those senses that doesn't appear to exist in here for whatever reason.

[Speaker 3]
What is Tyrona? She's human. I'm going to cling to her because I'm a halfling.

I'm small. I don't want to get carried away by the wind.

[Speaker 2]
It's probably like everybody koala on Tyrona because her familiar would also be having trouble.

[Speaker 3]
I keep forgetting that dude's there.

[Speaker 2]
So do we need to roll to keep our balance or what?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. If you guys are moving on I'm going to require a strength saving throw.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

Not yet. But you'll probably hear a thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. And a loud, almost swear word.

A loud, definite swear word. Oh, Mimosa would be like Ah, snails! Snails?

Oh god! Mimosa doesn't cuss.

[Speaker 2]
Tyrona does.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we all immediately start getting blown about I feel like our groups should have switched. Yeah. It feels like the more you pay attention to the baby screams, the more intense they get.

The more the physical pressure of them intensifies.

[Speaker 3]
Look on the ground. Eyes down. Eyes down, but we go in the direction of it.

[Speaker 1]
It looks like the Fey creature has been partially blown off is currently hanging by his fingertips.

[Speaker 2]
Would I have either wax or like cotton wool in my tinderbox? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
I'm gonna put it in my ears.

[Speaker 1]
That's a good fuckin' idea.

[Speaker 3]
I'll put mine too.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. I'll let you guys make the next Great fall. No, you'll just succeed at it in here right now.

You're able to catch up where the You're basically parallel to where the Fey is right now except you're a little further ahead. And there's the bottle right next to you.

[Speaker 3]
Grab it.

[Speaker 2]
And keep pressing on.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's the cradle in the back, that's where we're trying to get to, right? Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so I'm gonna make another strength check. Make this one public. Alright, he gets back up.

He's almost to the xylophone, but you guys are to the cradle at this point. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 3]
It's huge, right?

[Speaker 1]
It is.

[Speaker 3]
Climb. Um I feel like we're gonna need the xylophone too.

[Speaker 2]
I was kind of anticipating the Sylvan dude meeting us here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we think the xylophone's real? Is there not a red glow around the xylophone?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there is.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, there is? Oh shit, okay, yeah, no, we go get it. I missed that.

[Speaker 1]
Here's the thing, the fey critter is grabbing it at the moment. The xylophone is on the other path. You guys took the one that, let's say went around the right.

And the xylophone is on the left.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I'm gonna Mimosa's gonna get ready to run the other way and cut him off if he's gonna be a dick about this. That's a good idea.

I was, I'm planning on trying to talk it out a little bit. Yeah, you do that, but she's just gonna get ready, just in case she's gotta.

[Speaker 4]
You guys got this, I believe in you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, Kyrona's like She'll just take out her earplugs and let the wind carry her, honestly.

[Speaker 2]
I was gonna say Kyrona's gonna try and get his attention and gesture for him to cover his ears if he can.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, let's see here. Go ahead and make me a Deception check.

[Speaker 2]
Why Deception? I'm trying to help him.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you are. No, you're trying to get to him.

[Speaker 3]
In a roundabout way, but in a way that's like I wanna help him.

[Speaker 2]
This is his home. And he presumably doesn't He lives in this area. Presumably he doesn't want to be menaced by this giant baby creature.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna stick to Deception for reasons I'm not gonna explain just yet.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Is your Deception good? Ugh.

[Speaker 2]
Am I familiar?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think so. Can I scatter ball bearings in the wind and let them go tut tut tut tut tut?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can! He will trip and fall on them.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I mean I was hoping they would just Seriously?

[Speaker 2]
Kairona is like wants to be glaring at Mimosa but isn't because it's too funny.

[Speaker 3]
Her intention was not to trip him. It was that it would hit him in the head and he'd look back.

[Speaker 1]
I have You're ahead of him in terms of where these branching paths reconverge. He is furiously trying to get back at the army crawling to get at the xylophone. Kairona, what are you doing with the bottle if anything?

Because you all are now at this point, after climbing for a little bit, you're going to be where the baby is.

[Speaker 3]
I'm confused. Is there a way that Mimosa can just go to him on the islands?

[Speaker 1]
Sure, if you want to backtrack to Oh, we have to backtrack? Well, no, no. Imagine there are two paths from where you guys entered this room.

One goes left, one goes right. They reconverge at the cradle. If they're at the cradle, then you can choose whether you're going back down the left path or back down the right path.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I mean, I'll just if it's easy for me to move because my ears are plugged I'll just go help him. Real deception! I think on my way, if I can, I'm going to pick up the xylophone.

I thought he already had it. He's crawling towards it. He's trying his hardest to get there.

If I can, I want to pick up the xylophone on my way. If he gets it first, fine, whatever.

[Speaker 1]
Make me a Contested Dex check. Saving. Just a check.

I guess it could be Sleight of Hand. There's Faye. I need to look at this guy.

Cheeky, but I don't know. Alright, he has a bonus to this. That was his natural roll, so he's going to be there.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's fine. Do you have treats? You're not leaving your pillow?

Does he see me?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, he absolutely sees you. He's clawing at this xylophone.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just standing there tapping my foot.

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, he beat you on the check.

[Speaker 3]
I know, but I'm still just standing there tapping my foot. I'll give him the cotton swabs. Or I'll put them in his ears or whatever.

[Speaker 1]
He goes to look at you curiously for a moment and then goes to hold out his hands and then goes to shove you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Can I slap him with some handcuffs? Sure.

I should have some in my bag of holding.

[Speaker 1]
Let's do another contestant deck check.

[Speaker 3]
So that we're handcuffed together. Sleight of Hand.

[Speaker 4]
Where did you get these? My bag of holding. Do you have them for like a fun reason?

Yes.

[Speaker 1]
This could count as a fun reason.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yes, nice.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, you always need a pair of handcuffs. Exactly.

[Speaker 2]
You never know when they're going to come in handy.

[Speaker 3]
So we're handcuffed together now. I don't know how helpful that is, but we're handcuffed together.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, yeah, so you handcuff together and he looks very upset about this.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she'll smirk. She'll be like, so what was your plan, huh?

[Speaker 1]
You could hear him muffled, so he's like I'm going to calm that baby down.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I'm here.

[Speaker 1]
I don't believe you.

[Speaker 3]
She's going to point at Kyrona and be like where do you think she's going? She has the second object.

[Speaker 1]
She's not using it the right way. Make me a insight check at this point.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, please be good. I feel like I should get advantage for being a mom of five, but... I'll be right back.

[Speaker 1]
It does look like he's being a little bit of a shithead about it. You can't tell if he's lying.

[Speaker 3]
Did you raise children? How do you do a bottle wrong?

[Speaker 2]
Technically, you do need to sanitize it first.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so Kyrona at this point, what are you attempting?

[Speaker 2]
Does it look like there's anything going on around us? Or is it safe to pretty much wait for the other object? Because I don't think it makes sense to start climbing before we have everything.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you guys told me you were climbing like 10 minutes ago.

[Speaker 3]
I say just keep climbing. I'm also going to be like no matter what, you give that bottle to the baby.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, you are there.

[Speaker 2]
You guys told me you were climbing like 10 minutes ago.

[Speaker 3]
And you also saw him shover, and now they're shackled together. So there's obviously something happening.

[Speaker 2]
In my defense, it was Mimosa that said we were climbing.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I will climb. I mean, I could just say that she'd say keep going no matter what.

[Speaker 2]
If Mimosa thinks we should keep going, then I'll keep going.

[Speaker 1]
So at this point, you're with the baby. A large baby that is looking at you. Actually, somewhat calm a little bit.

Still like yelling, but reaching out for the bottle.

[Speaker 2]
All right. I'm going to use Prestidigitation to make it just the right temperature.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And then give the bottle to the baby.

[Speaker 1]
At this point, we're going to switch back to the other folks. Actually, we're going to take a short break, because I think Kibi is gone for the moment.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Okay. That's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Let's take a quick 10-minute break. I'm going to make sure that thing I'm keeping warm in the oven is not actually getting ruined in the oven. On fire?

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I almost wanted to sass him. Like, it's my experience. Babies cry harder when they see a bottle.

Some are fine. I made tortilla chips in the air fryer for the first time.

[Speaker 2]
How'd they turn out?

[Speaker 3]
Well, I was lazy.

[Speaker 5]
You got crunchy, babe.

[Speaker 3]
I can't hear you. That's because I was mixing them around. I got lazy, and I just kind of tossed them in so some are layered on top of each other so they're a little soft, but they look pretty good otherwise.

I almost handcuffed myself to that dude earlier on, but then I was like, no, no, because we're trying to run away from a baby. That's not going to work. So it's kind of validating.

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm validated there.

[Speaker 3]
You should listen to your handcuffed instincts. I should! Next time, I'm just going to listen to it the first time.

[Speaker 2]
I want to see you handcuff yourself to Maya. Maya, which is that one that always ends up handcuffed in dungeons.

[Speaker 3]
That's awesome! I'm handcuffed to your handcuff.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm back.

[Speaker 3]
Zah! Um... My mouth was handcuffed to the elf guy who tried to push her off the island.

We also took a break, so we'll be back.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, nice. Yeah! Tired.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty, so... He's not back yet, but Kibi, did you have any thoughts on what we could do? I feel like knocking the stuff over isn't the way to do it.

[Speaker 4]
What if we sit down at the table?

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Maybe.

[Speaker 4]
I think I'm sure there's adjacent chairs and whatnot.

[Speaker 5]
But who do we sit down with? Well...

[Speaker 4]
Maybe all of them?

[Speaker 3]
Just, like, find a seat and stay there? Yeah...

[Speaker 2]
I think you need to interact with the scenes in chronological order.

[Speaker 3]
Obviously, they don't take kindly to a kitty sitting at a table. On the table.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I kind of jumped on the table.

[Speaker 3]
Like, most.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know if they are chronological order.

[Speaker 4]
They're all in different timelines. Yeah, they're all in different realities.

[Speaker 2]
Time spaces?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, they all have their own uh... thing.

[Speaker 3]
Probably have to, like... I probably can't help you. Yeah.

He said no to Corona I know, that's why...

[Speaker 5]
Ugh.

[Speaker 3]
It's so... tempting. So I will keep my mouth shut about it.

[Speaker 5]
Shouldn't have that just yet. I was about to give Auggie his meds and was like, it's not even 7 yet. I thought it was way later.

Sorry, buddy, I fooled you.

[Speaker 1]
And we're back.

[Speaker 5]
Welcome.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, so. What's the plan for, uh, I heard some noise about sitting down at the table?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's our best guess right now. I mean, do we wanna sit at each...

Like, do we wanna try going in some order, or... Do we wanna pick a specific one? I don't know.

Let me ask you guys, what's the one that you guys like most? Personally, the sister with the daughter and the king.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
The queen seems like bad news bears. The one where they're all happy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, do we sit in their places, or do we sit next to them?

[Speaker 4]
Next to them.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, shoot. Let's do this then. Let's do this.

Alright, so y'all sit down at the table. The king immediately stands up. He's, like, very happy to see y'all.

Everybody else stands up at the same time. He mentions, he motions, he's like, no, no, no, stay seated, stay seated. I just want...

I know that not all of you could be here tonight, but I just wanted to reiterate my appreciation for bringing my family, my real family, back together.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, damn. Sorry, I know I'm not there, but...

[Speaker 1]
This is all I ever wanted. Just to have my daughter back, to know that she was lost to time and then regained to time, but then there was a traitor amongst my midst. The she-elf I came to marry, conspiring to kill her own sister out of misguided jealousy, has healed and brought my kingdom back together in ways that I couldn't even possibly begin to speculate on.

Not just healed in mind, body, and soul, but throughout time. Thanks to you.

[Speaker 4]
We certainly wouldn't have it any other way, I say in a cool kiwi voice that I don't feel like doing right now.

[Speaker 1]
It's a pity you weren't able to save the child, but I already have my daughter here, and I feel as if he's still out there somewhere. It's at this point that Kyrona hands the bottle to the baby. Everybody is ejected from the house at this point.

It now looks like a normal looking manor, dilapidated in the same way that the rest of the buildings around here are. Windows open, broken, front door open.

[Speaker 3]
I take it Mimosa's still attached to the guy.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
You are full of just the snippiest obvious Oh, you're full of beans! Beans? I was so close!

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I could taste that child's fortune on my teeth.

[Speaker 4]
That's strange.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi? Punch him. Kiwi isn't there.

We all didn't get ejected? Everybody was ejected. Everybody was ejected.

She says that as she's kicking him to get away from her, but Kiwi immediately punches him. You wouldn't understand. I could taste the...

[Speaker 4]
We are not tasting babies. You weirdo.

[Speaker 5]
You think he was as lucky as you think he was.

[Speaker 1]
He was brought out of time! There was no better meal.

[Speaker 3]
Does somebody have a silent spell? I mean, the toys are still there, right?

[Speaker 4]
You could go chew on them.

[Speaker 3]
That's right. There's one of those stupid rubber balls. She shoves it in his mouth.

He finds a pacifier.

[Speaker 1]
The good luck to regain one's fate in time is...

[Speaker 3]
Ugh, shove it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he's like, stop!

[Speaker 2]
Flinting, stop it! Wait, wait, hold on. You said the good luck to regain one's place in time.

Do you know how we can get that kid back?

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna roll her eyes like crap and pull the ball out of his mouth to fire him.

[Speaker 1]
Not as a normal child. No, that will never happen again. Or it is unlikely to, at the very least.

I don't know what else you might have done here, or what you might be here to do, but I'm guessing you're clearing the haunts, aren't you?

[Speaker 4]
Trying.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, pretty much.

[Speaker 1]
If I'm to give you any hints, I will need something in return.

[Speaker 3]
I could unhandcuff you.

[Speaker 1]
I'd take that deal. You'd take that deal?

[Speaker 2]
If you agree not to try and luck drain any of us afterwards.

[Speaker 4]
I will remove your head from your shoulders if you do, and I tap my axe.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not giving my word not to. We're just carrying on with the deal with the understanding that it would probably not be in my best interest.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if you can't agree to such simple terms, I suppose we'll just have to keep dragging you around.

[Speaker 3]
There's a truce between us while we're here.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not giving you anything, except for this what I can see is clearly very important information to you. You can take the information and then we part ways and whatever happens after that happens, but I'm not giving you my word on anything else.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if we've got him, we've got him. We might as well drag him back to the keep and do some experiments on him to find out how he does what he does. Kibi is very excited at the prospects of this.

Yes, how long has it been since you've been to that keep, by the way? Oh, we'll make a special trip just for you.

[Speaker 3]
All right. We don't have time for this. I'll make the deal.

But you are right here, and we will kill you if you try anything right away. That isn't every part of the deal, that's just what will happen if you try anything. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Mike holds his hands out for the manacle, or I guess for the key.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you're going to have to give us the information first. You tried to push me off the island.

[Speaker 1]
I'm afraid my word is bombed.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's true, huh? I'm going to get ready to...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sure. All right. I'm going to hold my action to swing, and immediately if he shows any aggression...

[Speaker 3]
Like just a stupid light thing, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you guys compete.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah. All right, well, she's going to uncuff him. She's like, you don't get these.

This is mine. I'll cuff him. All right, he's free of her.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. He starts off with... He starts off by saying, well, there are technically speaking two ways, one of which I know how to accomplish.

The first is you could bring him back as a spirit, as a hob to watch over the royal house and guide them. You do that by bringing the bottle there, and he points to the ground where a bottle, a baby bottle has been restored to like normal color and landed on the manor's bottom. You gotta find it...

Yes, you gotta bring this to the princess. And this will make... This will make...

Basically... I don't know how to explain this connection to you folks, but if you cement the connection between the princess and her unborn brother here, then no matter what else you do, if the baby is not born, it will become a spirit and will return to watching over the home.

[Speaker 2]
What's the other option?

[Speaker 1]
I suppose you could make the... I suppose you could make the baby be born into someone else.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Fun.

[Speaker 1]
But I don't have any... I don't have any clue how you would do that.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Let's... We'll do the first.

I actually wouldn't say that in front of him, but she'll just say... That's very unhelpful. And I do say that in front of him.

[Speaker 2]
Like, well, I only promised the one method. I'm pretty sure you promised two, but alright.

[Speaker 1]
No, I said... I knew of two, I just didn't know how the second one would be accomplished.

[Speaker 3]
You know how to do the first one. You don't know how to do the second one.

[Speaker 2]
That's correct. Alright. Alright.

I suppose we're quibbling.

[Speaker 3]
Well, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Can I go? I bet there's a bunch of loot in that manor house.

[Speaker 3]
Where's the xylophone?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it does not appear to be around.

[Speaker 3]
Okay then. Yes, on your merry way. Go away.

[Speaker 1]
I hope there's something good in this basement. It runs off into the manor house.

[Speaker 3]
I'll pick up the bottle.

[Speaker 4]
Can I sneak after him to look in the basement as well? Because that sounds interesting.

[Speaker 6]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 4]
You know what? I'm not going in that basement. This is a haunted basement.

Never mind. I'm escaping it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's not haunted anymore. Or at least not haunted enough for that guy to stay away.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I mean... You can always just call him to make sure he is going to the basement. Yeah.

If I don't come out in like... How long do you think it'll take to get down there? And back?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. 10 minutes?

[Speaker 4]
If I'm not back in a reasonable time, just go home.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I don't know about you, but please hurry back.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you get down. Right now he's looking through a wine collection. You can see a few arms and armor that are on mannequins on the other side that he clearly hasn't paid attention to.

[Speaker 4]
Anything... valuable?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah. There's three sets and they all look pretty well-preserved. Different types of armor.

There's plate, half-plate, quarter-plate, and... No. Something that looks like studded leather armor, but is made out of chitinous material instead.

All three of them have a black diamond in the center.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Well, I'll take the studded leather one first.

[Speaker 2]
That means it's extremely difficult armor. You know, black diamond.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I mean, I can't use it, but somebody can.

[Speaker 2]
It's worth money.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Are you just grabbing all three sets?

[Speaker 2]
Um, if possible, yeah. Sure. Um, I'll loan you my bag of holdings since you're the one going down there.

And you can, like, stuff everything in there.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah. I love the idea that, like, behind him you're just feeling shit quietly.

[Speaker 1]
He's like not even bothered. He's like, uh... He sinks his teeth into a wine bottle.

Like, doesn't open it or anything.

[Speaker 2]
Through the glass?

[Speaker 1]
He just goes through the glass. That's disturbing. He's just, like, happy as can be.

That's disturbing.

[Speaker 3]
Has QB seen other people drink wine before or was that her first time and now she thinks that's how everybody drinks wine. You know what, that's exactly it.

[Speaker 4]
Well, now that you've said it. Absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, well, I suppose our next stop would be the princess, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, since we don't know how to have the baby be born to the woman who was previously the queen's sister but has actually been the queen all along in the original timeline.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think she was originally the queen. This is too confusing for my brain.

[Speaker 2]
I think what happened was... Which one is the older and which one is younger?

[Speaker 3]
I think the queen was the queen but then they found out that she was going to betray them. So she got booted and he ended up with the sister.

[Speaker 1]
No, James, which one is older and which one is younger? Between the two sisters? You mean in terms of age?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The aunt is slightly older.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so let's call her A and the other one is B. So the king was originally married to A and B used magic to, I don't know, swap places with her, do some time magic and marry the king instead. And then when we went to the first haunt, A knew that B had betrayed her and that was why she turned herself into a banshee.

Now that we have changed things, it's back to being A is queen, B is not queen. That's good. Right?

Considering B was really shady, yes.

[Speaker 4]
Well.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think we should fuck with anything. At least right now. We can't get the baby prince to be born to A because we don't know how.

But we can get him to be bound to the princess and give the royal house a blessing which is a good thing.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So we're going to tromp over I just lost you for a moment. We're going to tromp over to the princess sector. Okay.

If everyone's in favor? Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Might as well.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
I'm imagining I'm imagining that on the way, Kiwi is telling us what she saw and we're all like, no that isn't normal, you can't try to drink wine that way you will break your teeth.

[Speaker 3]
And you will catch it. It looks fun. You'll get glass shards in your mouth and teeth and face.

[Speaker 2]
It looks fun up until you have to pay the dental bills.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have dental insurance. Kiwi does not have dental insurance.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe not. I feel like that should be part of our package. Don't we get benefits?

Don't we get benefits? I mean, maybe?

[Speaker 5]
I think I'm your healthcare.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I'm pretty sure you are the healthcare.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so y'all go to the let's see here, swing around to the other quarter. Are you making any stops along the way?

[Speaker 2]
Um, I don't think we should go check out the queen sector?

[Speaker 3]
I think we need to just get to the princess and make sure that that's dealt with and then we can go anywhere else. Yeah. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
In this case, assume y'all are going around swing around the bottom left to the bottom right.

[Speaker 2]
Are we in victim or new ghost? The baby was new ghost.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, shall we go straight through victim and see what's there?

[Speaker 3]
I mean that would I don't mind like skirting past it to see what it looks like but I don't want to get involved in it. Okay, that does sound smart. Until we finish with the princess.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
I really hope we do a good enough job to get paid for this.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we were ever planning on getting paid for this.

[Speaker 2]
I think we were.

[Speaker 3]
Mimosa will pat the back and she's like we already started to get paid. Yeah, we have the um... The armor.

Can you leave us? That's so rude. I'm just kidding.

[Speaker 4]
I'm too tired for my own good.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm back. Let's go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the plan is to do what? Are you skirting behind?

[Speaker 3]
We're skirting around the victim to get to the princess. We want to like finish the ghost goal and get to the princess. Objective.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Okay, so y'all go around to the princess angle probably around this large gate down here. There's a wall that's uh, was formerly bisecting this.

A city that appears to be dilapidated in other areas, but here it's mostly undamaged. Undamaged enough to stand. Y'all will be sort of ferried by the streets.

They're sort of designed to do this by funneling the streets into like larger and larger zones if you will until they reach a specific gate around this area. There's what appears to be a large troll looking creature wearing a hood building a very large scythe. I guess, no, it's more like a totem.

There happens to be a blade on top of it.

[Speaker 4]
Well, are we fighting this thing?

[Speaker 5]
Do we have to?

[Speaker 4]
Don't we want to try stealth?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I guess you guys would see this way before you guys would see this way before it sees you. So you could do your thing.

[Speaker 3]
I would prefer just stealthing. Trying to sneak by. I think we should say hi.

What makes you think that, Deary? Genuine question, there's no I mean she's not very good at stealth.

[Speaker 2]
No offense.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe she could say hi and everyone else runs the other way?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, no. We don't do that to actual party members.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, maybe it's just as simple as like a little toll.

[Speaker 3]
Perhaps he's friendly. Alright, why not? Well, perhaps not.

[Speaker 2]
What's the worst that could happen?

[Speaker 3]
I say, deeply sarcastically. Sure, let's go say hi.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
We're gonna go say hi. Alright, we're gonna go say hi.

[Speaker 1]
The troll just kind of like takes notice.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
He just takes notice as you guys get within about like 120 feet. His eyes just kind of like lock on you guys.

[Speaker 6]
There are ways.

[Speaker 1]
For you to step forward. To get about like 30 feet. He says something in giant first.

I think I speak giant. I do. Hold.

Hold? Hold.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm not sure if you're breaking up or if I'm not hearing you well. Oh no, he said hold. Sorry.

I just adjusted the game on my mic. Okay, I just hear for the others to stop.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. We stop.

[Speaker 1]
This is the edge of the realm of the damned.

[Speaker 4]
That's ominous.

[Speaker 2]
I will translate for the rest of the group. Can you tell us exactly what you mean by that?

[Speaker 1]
Terrible fates have befallen those you seek beyond this border.

[Speaker 2]
We do know that. I think we already knew that.

[Speaker 1]
They are predestined for strife and agony.

[Speaker 2]
Arguably that's true for everyone but I think especially so for royalty. So again, we kind of knew that.

[Speaker 3]
We'd like to fix it if we can.

[Speaker 2]
And I'll translate Pera's comment.

[Speaker 1]
I can allow you in at a price.

[Speaker 2]
Can you allow us out afterwards?

[Speaker 1]
That would be up to you. If you enter the realm of the damned, I cannot assist you in getting out. But you won't stop us.

No. This place is unstable. It may be that your actions within might see you escape.

Haunted lands like these rarely last long and my post here is a temporary assignment.

[Speaker 4]
They're like a... By who? Yeah, is there like a job posting for whatever this guy is?

[Speaker 1]
This is above your station. And you would not recognize the name if I gave it to you.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's fair. Would you tell us anyways in case we might recognize it later?

[Speaker 1]
I will not say it aloud.

[Speaker 2]
Could you write it down? He does. He does write it down.

I've got a notebook and a quill so I'm imagining it's like he's writing it on R scale. It would be like writing with a tiny piece of mechanical pencil lead.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it looks like a compass needle with three prongs on the top right of the needle on the northeast side of the compass and it has like two half circles drawn around it. This is a name only the dead can hear and say.

[Speaker 2]
I know celestial. Would I be able to read it?

[Speaker 1]
No, he was speaking very literally.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Alright, thank you for that information. So we've established you will let us pass.

You can't help us come back but you won't stop us from coming back? For a price. What is your price?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. I was judging 2,000 guilders.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it may interest you to know that we are here to resolve the reason why you are posted here. So perhaps that information would reduce your price a little?

[Speaker 1]
I don't see why.

[Speaker 4]
Does his armor do it for you?

[Speaker 2]
I think it'd be a bit small for him. I didn't hear what his price was.

[Speaker 5]
I heard 2,000 and then nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he said guilders, which is a common reference to gold.

[Speaker 5]
Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
In other lands at the very least.

[Speaker 3]
What about some candy and some treats? Can that be a partial payment?

[Speaker 1]
I could do 1,500 for some candy and treats.

[Speaker 3]
Gotta knock down a little bit. Everybody turn out your pockets.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, how much does everyone have?

[Speaker 4]
Or the what?

[Speaker 2]
Or the plate armor, he said.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hell yeah. We'll give it to him. I'll throw in some candies, anyway.

[Speaker 4]
I'll throw in a random javelin.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Why not? Mmm, toothpick.

[Speaker 6]
Hahaha.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
So, this part of the journey is actually quite simple. There's no combat here, there's no puzzle to be resolved in this instance, because you guys actually already resolve it. But you do view a repeat of the events along the way that happened to the daughter specifically while she was in the carriage.

And you view it from both perspectives. There were two streets heading down like this main thoroughfare that's basically a thin divider between. And you could see the previous timeline that you guys resolved acting in parallel with the other timeline.

[Speaker 5]
For the two of us who were not a part of that, could we have a little reminder?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may. That was partially why I did it. So, in the first timeline, the aunt, her name is Layla, arrives by Owlback.

Yes, it was a giant owl. Arrives by Owlback, having escaped her bodyguards who were ignoring her, and excitedly shows the daughter this neat little cocoon-looking thing that's sort of already been opened. At some point, she gives it to the queen's daughter.

At some point, the queen swaps this out with a second cocoon. Bandits attack. That's partially because the guy I think that had something to do with Kratom.

Might have been one of his interruptions, or maybe he just didn't find it. But, at some point, the carriage is attacked by bandits. The queen and her daughter are, sorry, the queen's sister, Layla, and her daughter are killed.

The priest is killed. Pretty much everybody is killed.

[Speaker 4]
TPK for them.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, pretty much. She steals away the bodies of her daughter and her sister. Her sister curses herself and And the princess.

And the princess with her dying breath. She unleashes a death curse.

[Speaker 4]
I hope that's how I go.

[Speaker 1]
The cocoon that's left behind when the bandits get in and start looting erupts into the obelisk that you guys saw. That loose creature that mimics other bodies of the people. And just begins tearing through the bandits.

[Speaker 4]
Right, the thing I have the goo of.

[Speaker 1]
Before eating the horses and the carriages themselves, you'll see them sink like they're going into another place. On the right hand side, you have the timeline that you guys created by interacting with the haunt the first time. Where you guys after backtracking a fair bit, basically going in reverse chronological order throughout the haunt, got to the origin point of the tragedy.

[Speaker 2]
That was the Swamp, wasn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Not quite. That was when... Oh, the Swamp.

I thought you said the Swamp. Yes, it was. Where Kratom's character interfered with the Swamp by taking both of them out.

And managed to interact with the priest character. Oh, the thing I should notice... One thing that I should note last about the original timeline, is that the queen took the face of her sister.

[Speaker 4]
She already had a pretty similar face.

[Speaker 1]
Except, not just in an illusory sense, also in a literal sense, like cut off the face.

[Speaker 5]
Face pizza.

[Speaker 1]
And cut off her own face. And put that on the...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there we go. That's what I was missing. Okay.

That's awful. That's so gross. We resolved that.

And when we left the Cairn, the queen was still the queen and not pretending to be Layla.

[Speaker 1]
When you guys left the Cairn, the queen was still the queen and not pretending to be Layla. That's correct.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. And that was in the quote-unquote fixed timeline. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we did fix it for her.

[Speaker 1]
Not so much fixed as just newest. Yeah, adjusted. The new timeline.

[Speaker 2]
Timeline B. We are now moving into Timeline C.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, we'll see what's...

[Speaker 2]
I really hope we don't end up in Timeline M. Right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Let's see here. Alright, so on the right-hand side, you see the adjusted timeline where you guys swapped out the cocoons and eventually, I think Kratos just...

Kratos' character just took both of them. You guys managed to split the veil a little bit and talk to the priest that was nearby. After chatting with him for a fair bit, let's see here, he was convinced to basically send...

let's see here, I think what he ended up doing was he ended up talking things over with the queen's sister, who went to go scout ahead. And he took a carriage to scout ahead as well. Those two ended up getting killed.

But the queen and all the guards were ready at this point. And they went forward and they weren't going to be. Basically, the priest and the queen's sister sprung the ambush.

And then all the guards...

[Speaker 2]
I thought the queen's sister survived and just the priest died.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. No, the queen's sister is dead in Timeline B. Okay.

Still dead in Timeline B. It was assumed that she wasn't dead in Timeline A. But she is still dead in Timeline B.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Which also puts to rest a question that was going around for some of the folks that were confused about. They weren't sure if the queen disguised herself as her sister or not, or if it was the sister that was evil, or the sister who caused the ambush. It was the queen who caused the ambush in both cases.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Fuck the queen. Indeed.

[Speaker 1]
It was just in the first timeline, she took the identity of her sister and moved on.

[Speaker 2]
Wasn't she the Obelix in that one, though? In Timeline A?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. What's next on the agenda?

[Speaker 1]
Something of note is that the queen was attempting to recall her guards when they went to assist her sister and the priest.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Dick move.

[Speaker 3]
And classy.

[Speaker 1]
While you're following along with the while you're following along with these two, or after you've followed these two carriages to their destinations, it seems as if you've moved through the city a fair bit faster than you normally would. You arrive at a scene of the daughter, the princess, switching between basically different timelines where she's either getting killed, or playing with her little brother, or staring at an empty crib.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should give the bottle to her in one where she's playing with the brother.

[Speaker 3]
That sounds good.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. Because the alternative is giving it to her in the one where she's staring at the empty crib. And that is definitely the one where the baby isn't born.

And I feel like if we give it to her in one where the baby has been born, then it's possible that he will be born.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's like best case scenario.

[Speaker 4]
That would be incredibly sadistic to hand a baby bottle to you. A woman who is mourning the death of a baby.

[Speaker 2]
Or at least the absence of one.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. The absence of one. Because that's, you know, that's sad.

[Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so we give it to her when she's playing with her baby brother.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Just to confuse her first, she's like, oh, did my father send you?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. This is Matthias. I don't know if you've met him before, but he's, oh, we thought we'd lost these.

[Speaker 2]
Nope, we found it for you.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you have our royal gratitude. Come here, Matthias. Look what we found, Matthias.

Here you go.

[Speaker 6]
Aw, that's cute.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, um... So what was going on in the... Well, we didn't have any problems getting here, so we don't think we'll have any problems.

We... Just leaving. Would be my assumption.

[Speaker 5]
You kind of implied we would. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

[Speaker 1]
Is it easier to die or come back to life?

[Speaker 2]
Definitely easier to die, but that's not something we want to try out today.

[Speaker 4]
Between dying and coming back to life, I would definitely pick coming, or yeah, being safe. Not getting killed.

[Speaker 3]
When we take a step back from this scene, does anything change?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, is there any monochromatic font stuff going on?

[Speaker 1]
Still, the scenes are still repeating, yes. It's just in one of them she's playing with the bottle with her brother. Though the scene around you has changed somewhat.

The buildings around you no longer look like it looks like delusion has been stripped away. The buildings are made of bone.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Lovely.

[Speaker 1]
And the wall that you guys had passed through, under the gates of, looks about two miles taller from this perspective, and you can't really tell if there's... It's... The ceiling was already dark for obvious reasons, like impossible to see dark, because you guys are in a cave that's under, like, miles under the earth.

Something about it just seems ever so slightly lighter, in terms of shade. Alright, so, where to next?

[Speaker 3]
Victim, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, can we get that? Because it is in the wall, to some degree.

[Speaker 2]
I thought the wall was where we came in. The wall is where you came in.

[Speaker 1]
There is a giant hole in the center of the city.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
And from the outside, you guys didn't see any way in, but from this angle, you guys can see a nice little spinal staircase winding downwards.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Spinal.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Along the way, you folks will be accosted by three ghosts, each of them demanding a tribute or trip back to the skinlands.

[Speaker 2]
I will give each of them a silver, sylvan leaf.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. All of them are very happy with this.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Happiness. And that is why I pick up something from everywhere.

To say hungry ghosts.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. So you guys take your trip down into this hole. You can see where it looks like there's some kind of field of energy above the hole that you guys have to like depress downwards through.

It's soft. It's like walking through cream or silk or spiderwebs on your way down. But if you touch it after going down the staircase a fair bit, it's much more resistant.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. That's not in any way worrying.

[Speaker 1]
You're gonna take like a fine temp Alright.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I'm back.

[Speaker 4]
Welcome.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that was me. Wasn't it? Yeah.

There's a whole OSR section on itch.io. A what section? OSR. Um. Old school revival TTRPG stuff.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. That's cool. Excuse me.

I did not see that coming. I see a lot of Wanderhome stuff on itch. I really want Wanderhome.

It looks so cozy.

[Speaker 5]
What's Wanderhome?

[Speaker 4]
Um. It's a TTRPG. But it's like a really wholesome one.

[Speaker 5]
Mmm.

[Speaker 4]
And I like wholesome things. Like you make a little animal dude. A little animal person.

You live in this world where pretty much all you do is wander. It's a community. I think it's a community building game as well.

[Speaker 5]
Mmm. Yeah, I know I have a couple of games from itch.io for tabletop, and I haven't found ones that I like. They're all very introspective, the ones I have.

And it goes from being like, oh, this is a neat concept to, oh, this is supposed to be therapy in disguise. Which is not necessarily what I'm looking for.

[Speaker 4]
You're right.

[Speaker 5]
I've tried the solo RPG ones and I don't do well with them. Anyway, he's back.

[Speaker 1]
Hello. God is back. My voice doesn't sound that nice.

Pose.

[Speaker 5]
Are we all back? I think we're all back. I'm here.

Daron, are you here?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Alrighty. So you folks descend down your spiral staircase.

Spinal spiral staircase till the ambient light from the various glowing lichens above fades to black and those of you... Even those of you who can see in the dark find the edges of your vision constrained to no more than a few meters out.

[Speaker 2]
Even with magical vision? Indeed. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
In fact, the boys have begun commenting on it. Speculating whether they're in the realm of the dead or they're in a sub-realm of the dead. Whether they're dead now.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi's trying to spook them. Her tail brushes up against their leg and occasionally just freak them out. Like their ankle.

Yes.

[Speaker 3]
If Mimosa sees that, she's gonna like... walk her fingers up their back or shoulder or something.

[Speaker 5]
Can she reach their back or shoulder? That's all right. Damn it.

Never mind.

[Speaker 4]
Just bite their ankles or something. You got this.

[Speaker 3]
She might. Yeah, she might kind of bump their leg. I guess she's four feet tall.

No, no, no. It's fine. She'll just bump their leg like Kibi's doing with her tail.

But with a more solid object.

[Speaker 1]
Their dark vision is fading so they can't quite see you.

[Speaker 2]
Properly. Everyone's gonna separate the others from... Para and in front of Chirona and then the other two have to walk behind Chirona.

Chirona also has a tail. Stop bullying the intern.

[Speaker 1]
These poor kids.

[Speaker 3]
I only did it a couple times.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know how intentional Para's tail is. It's more for balance. So it's just kind of out there.

I feel like they would be running into her tail unintentionally.

[Speaker 4]
Mine's always flicking. So people are bound to run into it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm also used to Jake or something. She's the most intentional but she only pokes them once.

[Speaker 2]
Is it worth trying to light the drift globe?

[Speaker 5]
For those who might be having a harder time seeing?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if we want to see what's out there.

[Speaker 2]
I would say wait until we get to the bottom. Okay. I was gonna say I had a Cocker Spaniel when I was young that had a docked tail and when he tried to wag his tail he would just shake his entire butt.

[Speaker 3]
I love the nubbin and that's what I'm imagining Para's tail is like.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's more like if you put a plunger on a chicken.

[Speaker 6]
Oh! Draw her!

[Speaker 1]
I'm sorry, if you put a water on a chicken?

[Speaker 6]
Yes!

[Speaker 5]
Oh god. Of course Discord's not gonna help. So it was done as an experiment to see how dinosaurs walked because, you know, dinosaurs use their tails as counterbalance and all that.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh, you just mean how she walks.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Oh my gosh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
While you guys are looking that up I'm gonna return to the game real quick. Let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
Poor chicken. But we're good now. I mean, at least it's not the other way around.

[Speaker 2]
Like a plunger with chicken on it?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the handle side in.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so after what seems like hours walking, we'll finally arrive at the bottom of here. Wherever here is.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, you wanna try the drift globe now?

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Um... Do we wanna do light or daylight?

[Speaker 3]
I would... Which one's the least bright? I don't feel like we wanna draw a lot of attention to ourselves.

[Speaker 2]
They're gonna be equal brightness but daylight might do damage to things down here.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think daylight does damage.

[Speaker 2]
Or piss them off at least.

[Speaker 5]
Daylight is a 60-foot radius sphere of light that kind of like floats around us. Um... And then light...

Light, light, light, light, light, light, light.

[Speaker 3]
Do I not have light?

[Speaker 5]
I don't have light. I don't know what light does.

[Speaker 3]
Daylight it is then.

[Speaker 5]
Um... When I click on it it says I don't have any permission to view that item. Um...

So that's weird.

[Speaker 3]
It is an M&M. Don't tell me you don't like it.

[Speaker 5]
So I'm just gonna quickly sneak over here and this is the wrong one. SRD spells light. Light, okay.

Light is smaller, actually. Light is only a 20-foot radius. So I think for now let's just do light.

Okay. We'll do the little light.

[Speaker 6]
Upon casting it... Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was wondering if we would be able to finish up by like the next hour?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. It's not gonna take that long. I don't think it is.

Let's see here. You guys cast light and immediately you are greeted with a color vision. This time whatever fog was hanging around you seems to be repelled away.

You can see a bunch of rather exotic looking evergreen pines. In fact you recognize them from the northern end of the valley. The northern end of the valley has a number of evergreen species which are not natural in origin.

These branches stick out in something approximating a halo and their needles are partially translucent. They have something of like a stained glass effect upon the ground.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my god. Well that's fascinating.

[Speaker 4]
Um, can I take like a seed of some kind? A pine cone?

[Speaker 1]
No, I was giving you guys a gap to react. I love my ooze and oz. Um, yes you can.

The pine cones similarly look like these little what would you say those little like windmill spinners? I guess they're just called spinners that kids will play with. That's kind of what the pine cones look like.

Just a little stick and a bunch of their little like flakes or scales arranged in that windmill pattern.

[Speaker 2]
I'll take a couple um, pine cones.

[Speaker 3]
Same. I'll take the pine cones too.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I want them for decoration. They seem pretty.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Um, so you guys continue along. Nice light at your side. Uh, there's shadows cast upon the ground which are not cast by the light.

They're cast by something that approximates a sun. But you guys can't see it. You can't see any light sources or anything like that.

But you just notice that the shadows do not correspond with where you're standing or where your light is.

[Speaker 4]
It's probably the spell. No? Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
What do we see if we look up? If you look up, it's just dark. Make me an investigation check or an arcana check.

Seem pretty good. Uh, there is a glamour on this. As you stare harder and more intently just convince that there is something up there.

You see this swirling vortex of souls going upwards. Or what looks like upwards.

[Speaker 2]
Well that's not in any way disturbing or alarming.

[Speaker 4]
Where they need to be. Hopefully.

[Speaker 3]
Where they need to be.

[Speaker 4]
Why don't we get where we need to be before those things like come down here and eat us? I don't know what their plans are.

[Speaker 1]
Who knows, man. But yeah, so you guys continue along. Eventually you come across a cabin.

Elven construction. It is made of logs, but the elven log cabins tend to be a bunch of like teepees, basically. I bet they're gorgeous.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna mid-journey it. Hold on. I gotta see what an elven log cabin would be like.

Hell yeah. They just tend to focus on a vertical pattern for the rest of them upwards.

[Speaker 2]
Go ahead, Kaeran. I'm imagining the night elf architecture in World of Warcraft. Huh.

Hell yeah. But anyways. So, any evidence of habitation?

[Speaker 1]
Listen carefully. You can hear the front door on the other side opening and closing over again.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy. Is it another loop where the people are just doing the same reactions over and over again?

[Speaker 2]
Only one way to find out.

[Speaker 5]
I think that's the theme of the week. Well, check it out.

[Speaker 4]
Also, so far the log cabins are looking pretty cool.

[Speaker 1]
I can't wait to see them. Okay, so. Going around the front, you guys see King Singvir actually.

Very far from home. You just see the door open and it's him exiting. Again, monochrome.

Closing. Or him entering and then closing. Again, monochrome.

It stops once you guys get closer.

[Speaker 2]
Did you say entering or exiting?

[Speaker 3]
Both.

[Speaker 1]
That's the loop.

[Speaker 3]
He's a cat right now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. There's a flash of him leaving the building. There's a flash of him entering the building.

And then there's just the door being shut or open. Like I said, it stops once you guys get close by.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Yeah. That's pretty much the only thing I see to do.

[Speaker 1]
Once you guys are in, it goes monochrome. Oh boy. There are three objects which are not monochrome.

This building. There is a letter that has a few embellishments on it so that you know that it's in color. Otherwise it would be paper and ink.

It's got like a red ribbon on it. Exactly. It's a little seal.

There is a ring with a very hefty, it looks like a diamond at first, but it's actually just this very clear amber.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
And the third object is a spellbook.

[Speaker 4]
Somebody should take a look at that. Somebody with arcane knowledge.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take a look at it. Blake thinking that the boys tried to go first and then... You just stopped them.

[Speaker 2]
We should... Yeah. Kyrona like puts out a foot and trips them.

[Speaker 3]
Aww. And you were trying to make us not bully them earlier. You're gonna trip them.

[Speaker 2]
There's a difference between bullying when they deserve it and bullying when they don't.

[Speaker 1]
She just wants all the boys to herself. Unbelievable. Okay, so we'll go for the spellbook first.

Yep. Let's see here. You are technically an arcane spellcaster.

I'm a primal spellcaster.

[Speaker 2]
What languages do you speak? Celestial, Common, Elvish, Giant, and Sylvan.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, this is in none of those. But going over it, there are a few details that you notice immediately. First is that this actually has a very well-made and well-disguised book jacket.

The cover is not its actual cover. It's meant to look very unassuming. But as you go over it, because you're used to this by now, as you go over it and look more intensely, you can see that the if you peel back the jacket a little bit, you can see that the cover is actually composed of an elven face.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Oh! I immediately drop it back on the table.

What is it?

[Speaker 1]
Once it leaves your hands, it stays there. I don't like that.

[Speaker 3]
I quickly grab the paper and the ring just so it doesn't disappear with this nonsense.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to address the book in Sylvan. I know the writing isn't in Sylvan, but I feel like it's an elvish face, so I'll try to be elvish if Sylvan doesn't work and say, can you communicate?

[Speaker 1]
You do not get a response. Not immediately.

[Speaker 2]
What happens if I reach out to it? Just like very slowly? Let it kind of see me coming?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing appears to happen besides you take the book back in your hand and All right. I'll do that. I don't like doing it.

[Speaker 3]
I'll do it.

[Speaker 1]
Meantime, who has the ring and who has the letter?

[Speaker 3]
I like this. I grabbed both. I can hand one to someone else if they want to take it, but I grabbed both just in case.

I feel so cursed.

[Speaker 5]
I'll read the letter. Why not?

[Speaker 4]
I'll watch you guys.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi's the smart one.

[Speaker 4]
No. Kibi is just the dumb like she's... Yeah, I'm not touching that.

[Speaker 2]
Today, Kibi is the smart one.

[Speaker 1]
The letter is fairly simple. It just says as of this day, my right of seeking has ended. I cordially invite the eldest daughter of this house to be my wife and join me in rulership over the cairn.

This is the place I was guided to. I hand this letter in full witness over spirits of my ancestors and families and all those I take command over and may the gods and and lords of our kind bless this year.

[Speaker 5]
So he always planned on the older sister.

[Speaker 2]
The older sister was Layla.

[Speaker 1]
At this point the first scene begins or I guess technically speaking the second one. You see... How do I pronounce her name?

Marichelle? There we go. Marichelle.

I say it like I'm chewing a cigarette. Coming through the door. Moving for her book first and then looking over and noticing the letter in the ring.

[Speaker 2]
I'm holding the book and I just kind of bring it up close to my face and say, oh buddy, no wonder you're fucked up.

[Speaker 1]
She goes over, reads it, she goes, she like gasps with excitement and then anger. The book appears to say something. Actually, no, you guys hear it in spite of the fact that you're not part of the scene, generally speaking.

The noise has not reached you, Indy. You hear, remember the blood of king. All yours for royal blood.

And then she goes over and mails him.

[Speaker 3]
Are you paying attention to him? No. Well then, that's why he's crying.

[Speaker 1]
She goes over to the letter. She hides it, she like tucks it. She goes to tuck it in her back pocket.

And the last thing she does is you see her take out the wand and you see her cast something on the cast something on the ring.

[Speaker 3]
Uh oh. Can I look at the ring?

[Speaker 1]
You see, it kind of looks like it has spiders crawling over it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I throw that ring on the table.

[Speaker 4]
She wouldn't happen to be drow, would she? Nope.

[Speaker 1]
And also, drow in this part of the world do not damage spiders.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, they're not associated? Does that creep out Dan away from the ring? So, who does do spiders?

[Speaker 2]
Do we know that?

[Speaker 1]
Nobody in particular. I would say it's not a common thing. There was actually one fey hollow that the party came across in one of the first sections actually that had a lot of spiders.

Uh, that had a shit ton of spiders in it. But that was associated with one specific sylvan. A minor lord.

[Speaker 3]
I'll steal myself and pick the ring back up. Is it just like a continual image of like the same spiders crawling all over it?

[Speaker 1]
It is. They seem fairly faint and ethereal on your end. Um, at this point the second scene is going to be...

I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's not.

I fucked up. I misread my notes here. Okay, so at this point the book is going to say well, where will you place us now?

[Speaker 2]
Where would you like to be placed? In the fire.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, by all means. Take off my jacket and place me right over the ring.

[Speaker 2]
So it's under the jacket is the elven face?

[Speaker 1]
Correct.

[Speaker 4]
I'll let you guys make this decision because I have absolutely no idea.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like we should not do what the evil book says. Yeah. And Kyrona is like still holding it as she's saying this and it's like, no offense.

[Speaker 3]
What... What would happen if we did that? Kibi has no idea.

Oh, sweet. Sweet darling. I'm asking the book.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, say again. What was the, uh... I thought you were...

[Speaker 3]
What would happen if you put the book over the ring?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, um... We would get a much happier ending.

[Speaker 5]
For whom? Can we incite the book? Yeah.

Yeah, I'll incite the book. Well, I'll incite the book. Can I incite the situation?

Do you guys need to incite the book? That's why I said situation instead.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can do the situation.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna incite the book just to see if I am smart enough to get it. That's funny. Because I have been really careful.

Oh, darling. Okay. Oh, Kibi.

Oh, no. I just... I haven't gotten anything above like a six.

[Speaker 1]
This is the start of a beautiful love story.

[Speaker 5]
Ugh. God damn it. Distant saxophone.

Ugh.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Um, so.

[Speaker 4]
Kibi's distracted.

[Speaker 1]
So, Kibi and Arthur are talking between themselves. They're probably the ones distracting Kibi right now. We need to take a look at that book.

The Blood of Kings. There's not much magic that has to do with royalty. And most of it sucks, I gotta tell you.

Arthur's like, well, how did you read that? Well, I was in the restricted section, and you know, I just did a little digging. It's mostly necromancy.

Mostly necromancy, but that's the stuff. I was like, well, why the hell would that be in the Glass College? I think they're keeping it from Groudmont Thule.

Um, Arthur's like, isn't some of her magic pretty good against Undead? He's like, and Jimmy says, well, yeah, some of it is, but most of it is actually, a lot of the really powerful stuff is way out of the league.

[Speaker 3]
Boys, focus. I would say they are focusing, but...

[Speaker 1]
The point is, um, it's... Um... This books up to no good.

Yeah. Um, and with all the context clues I've seen, I've learned a lot of things about the world that I did not want to know. Um, like, uh, time.

Wasn't a huge fan of that. Um, those are from context clues. Does anybody here know anything about Elves?

What that Rite of Seeking thing is?

[Speaker 2]
We don't have an Elf here, do we? Um, I was gonna ask, um, cause the letter didn't get read out loud, but I was gonna ask if we knew what that was.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, Perra would have been reading it out loud, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
No, I figured as much. Um, the Bow will know what it is. Like, ah, yeah, Rite of Seeking.

Uh, King goes around, asks to see for royalty, really. Any lord can do it. But it's usually kings that, especially if they're, um, they just haven't found anybody suitable, but it's, you know, it's time to...

Or if they've been overly picky about it, we'll say they haven't found anybody suitable. So they'll go on the Rite of Seeking to prove it. Um, on the Rite of Seeking, they'll look around for a home that they know has a bunch of, uh, She-Elves in it, and he will extend his invitation.

Uh, there are spirits guiding the land, it's like a ten-step process. You gotta follow some stars, follow some signs, gotta watch a leaf fall, and go in the direction it points. It's very, it's very boring.

I personally could not wait that long for marriage, but, um, you know, what the Elves do is what the Elves do. They're not as sophisticated as my kind, that's why. Um, and yeah, so they get there, they'll invite, it's always the eldest daughter, um, just to avoid any weirdness, I assume, or awkward conversations, and there it is.

If she, if she, she has the right to reject her, and he's not allowed to look to see who lives in there. Uh, but the Rite of Seeking pretty much, pretty much always grants, like, just absolute joy. Um, even when it's not the eldest daughter.

It usually goes really well for him.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean, even when it's not the eldest daughter?

[Speaker 1]
Um, well, like, most privileges and gifts in Elven society, you can extend them to somebody else, even if you've been selected for them. Oh, it can be re-gifted. Yeah, pretty much.

So, I mean, I don't know anybody who would willingly do that. I mean, have you been to the Banyan Cairn? Of course you have.

I've been on your back, being on the page of the Banyan Cairn.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, you don't know if she...

[Speaker 1]
No, Kyrona! You just broke up with the last half of your sentence.

[Speaker 2]
I said, hey, you don't know if she's a lesbian.

[Speaker 1]
Even still. Listen, if I got invited, come on now. I can play the part of royalty.

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty sure you can't, my dude. You're a beau.

[Speaker 1]
Come on. First of all, love is love, and that's very judgmental of you. Second of all, I could still be supportive.

I'd never leave his side. Or back. Hang on, that would be funny.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
So... So the objects have been reset, and I'll tell you guys out of character, I guess, or maybe this could be the beau saying this, but you guys have an opportunity to place them within the scene. How would you like to do it?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
And the book didn't seem upset about the thought of being put in the fire?

[Speaker 3]
I think he just ignored it. Yeah, he sidestepped it. Mm-hmm.

No book wants to be put in the fire.

[Speaker 2]
There. Oh, so he was just sarcastic about it.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, he did not respond.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he ignored me. Alright.

[Speaker 5]
She noticed the letter, so maybe if we hide the letter and put it somewhere where she wouldn't look?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Would the fire even destroy the book, though?

[Speaker 1]
Well, the next scene that comes up is going to be after the...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so if we just put the paper out in front for the oldest sister to see... Oh, so it's not repeating again?

[Speaker 2]
It's moving forward? Looks like it.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, so...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I would say put the letter out for the playlet to see.

[Speaker 3]
What about the ghastly ring?

[Speaker 2]
Maybe the ring, too, but not the book?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. I hope it isn't cursed. Did she do magic on the ring?

She did magic on the ring.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, she made it have spiders.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, then, just the letter.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, Mimosa will take out... If I can do this. Take out a little piece of paper and say like, practical joke on the ring.

And then put the ring on the paper and set it down. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
With the other letter as well?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And where is the book at the moment?

[Speaker 2]
Um, Rona is holding it, hoping to keep it out of the scene entirely. It's not going to...

[Speaker 1]
You can hide it somewhere. You can move it somewhere. If you're holding it, it's going to be set to its original position.

[Speaker 3]
Put the book in the toilet. In the poop bucket.

[Speaker 4]
Um, great idea.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you. I mean, do we want to hide it from his sister, though?

[Speaker 2]
Throw the book out the back door. Because I don't want it somewhere where it could talk and she could hear it.

[Speaker 1]
That's probably going to be somewhere like, again, in a toilet, maybe in a cupboard, or something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so if we put it in a cupboard, she won't hear it? Is there a bed? We could put it in the mattress.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys say, like, we're going to put it somewhere where they can't hear it, I'm not going to be like, oh, that wasn't the right decibel...

[Speaker 3]
Ah, you fooled! She went to clean the mattress of the bed!

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, we just put it somewhere she won't hear it.

[Speaker 1]
It's not that kind of quantum mystery, it's the other kind of quantum mystery where you get to do fucky shit with time.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Um... Yeah, alrighty. So, both the sister...

Or, sorry, both Queen Marichal... Marichial... Marichial?

Marichial. It's like Marisha, but, like, E-L. And Layla.

They both walk through the door. And... Layla...

Okay, Marichal goes over to the counter where she thought she left her book, and she's, like, looking around, confused. Layla, instead, turns, looks over. She's like, oh, did you lose your journal again?

Let me help you look for it. And turns to the left and sees on the counter a letter in a ring. She goes, oh, who could this letter be from?

And... Marichal is, like, digging around her back pockets frantically because she thought she took the letter. And Layla goes, oh, oh my, oh my goodness.

I... Ooh. And she goes over to look at the ring.

Initially recoils, but sees a little bit of a string of paper tied around it. Opens it up. Reads it.

And she goes, huh. Thought the spiders were something of an odd trick, but if I'm to have a comedian for a husband, I'm certainly not going to say no. Just going to close my eyes while I slip this on.

And she puts the ring on her finger. Marichal, in the meantime, goes to... You see her mouth opening.

And you see the sorts of magic in the air. More clear here than anywhere else. You see, like, a death curse appearing from her mouth.

A number of arcane symbols that those of you who've seen, like, a finger of death or perhaps an anime dead or something like that, you've seen these symbols before. Anybody with any kind of arcane sight of it is fortunate to be around necromancers as...

[Speaker 4]
Are we allowed to slap her? Your hand will go through.

[Speaker 1]
It wouldn't do anything. Something is already in the process of doing that. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Okay, what's happening?

[Speaker 1]
You guys see the symbol from earlier that the troll wrote in the ground for you appear under... under Marichal. The rest of the scene fades away, including Layla.

There's just Marichal struck, frozen in terror, but not in time. And the book, from wherever it was left, now with no boundaries between it and... Now with no boundaries between it and it.

No physical boundaries, or metaphorical ones for that matter, between it and its new prey. The process of counterspelling, and you see Marichal get sucked into the open mouth of the book's pages.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Barnet. Of the book's cover. Spat back out as like a mangled mess, and then sucked back into the book's open pages.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh. Ooh. Oh.

We definitely need to burn that book. Destroy it. Yeah, we need to destroy it.

Is that her diary, though? Does that count?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think it's actually her diary. I think it's some kind of fell grimoire.

[Speaker 3]
She disguised it as her diary so no one would suspect. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
So, do we get another scene after that?

[Speaker 1]
You do not. You do, however, hear a rather heavy tread behind you. The book is currently laughing at you guys as you try to like grasp at it.

[Speaker 3]
Grasp at what?

[Speaker 1]
As you try to grasp at it. At the book.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. It's playing keep away.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you don't want me. You're not going to hear a deep voice, this time in common, behind you. I do not want to.

I'm afraid that is for another time.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, trust me, we definitely do. Trust me, we definitely do not want it, and I just hold the book out to him.

[Speaker 3]
We don't have the book, but we can step to the side and be like, if you can take it someplace or it won't cause trouble, be our guest.

[Speaker 1]
I'm afraid I can't take it either. The troll that you saw from earlier still has his totem, but he's currently wielding an oversized magical black sword, which is currently sheathed at his waist, and the magical blade armor that is formed to adjust its size to his body.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Hey, nice studs.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, I have you to thank for it, as well as the new position. I suspect the book here was going to entice you into its dome if you wanted to get out of the Underworld.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, we've already got... I mean, I've already got one of those. Can't speak for you guys.

[Speaker 3]
I don't need help from a book.

[Speaker 1]
You might have been stuck here then. Perfectly happy to test your resolve, but as it happens, I am able to, again, just as a kindness, my new patron informs me I am to repay a kindness unto you.

[Speaker 3]
We are very grateful. Did we end it?

[Speaker 2]
The book is currently like, wait, wait, you don't want to see what happened? I mean, I'm pretty sure we did see what happened.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yes, in the new version of things, but oh, oh, I can't stand to be the only one to remember this.

[Speaker 2]
No, I don't think we want to know what happened.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, my deeds must be shared with everyone. Gross, dude. Most importantly, the troll is at this point kind of intrigued.

Apparently I have to trade in stories now. That's something I have to give to the blog. He says, well, you see, the letter was hidden, but the ring was not.

So I told her that if she cast a glamour upon the, a rather foul-looking glamour upon the ring, she might do something like, she would throw it away and then all Mont Rochelle would have to do is catch it. And then the right to accept the gift of seeking the gift from the right of seeking would have been hers to claim, rightfully. Because the eldest gave it up.

That's the oldest trick in the book.

[Speaker 3]
How very clever of you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it worked perfectly, but the clever part, the clever part, was the holes in time that the magic she used ripped and needed to be cleansed, cauterized, cured, bringing us back here. Ah, she swore so vigorously I would never have her sold for the magics I showed her. And look how that turned out.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, very good. You did good. Good job.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you, thank you. For giving value of good. I can feel the timekeeper is whisking me away, but it was nice meeting all of you.

Ah, shame I didn't get to consume you as well. Farewell.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, um, can we ask the troll for, if not his name, then a way to identify him? Should we meet again?

[Speaker 1]
No, that's not the troll speaking, that's the book.

[Speaker 2]
I know. But I figured the troll was taking the book and leaving.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, the troll's not one of those guys. You don't see anything as the book is just, like, dragged off into the darkness.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Two separate entities.

[Speaker 4]
What now?

[Speaker 2]
I think we head back to the cairn now.

[Speaker 3]
Uh... Yeah. Don't you need a seed from here?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think so. Yeah, it was in her little quest thing that she's gotta find a resonance seed. Oh, no, that's not here.

No? This is the haunt, isn't it? No, the resonance seed is another quest that's gonna take place somewhere else.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait, no, I know what you might be talking about.

[Speaker 3]
Um... When the resonance seed embedded near the haunt awaken your daggers.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that is a separate resonance seed.

[Speaker 4]
Shall we return? Return this quest in?

[Speaker 1]
I think so. The troll says, I could take you to the- I could take you outside of the seed. That might do something if you're seeking it.

I know where it is, but I can't gain entry myself.

[Speaker 4]
Could you map the map for us?

[Speaker 1]
I could- It'll be in the space- This realm of the dead is collapsing. We'll actually be on top of it when it finishes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so you're just gonna give a safe passage, and we just need to wait.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty much. He taps his totem on the ground, and the thick darkness around you dissipates. Uh, evaporates specifically.

It looks like little pieces of glass turning to dust fading away. Uh, giving way to yet again a fairly dark area, but it's just beyond the dark. It's nothing special compared to where you just were.

But you are standing on top of a uh, engineered- very clearly engineered contraption. Something that looks like a composition of metal roots and vines and wires and plating. That's at this point- Elevators?

Mimosa's- No, not quite. Uh, Mimosa's weapons begin glowing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
We'll find out what those do next time. Link Sessions.

[Speaker 3]
Okay! My dagger of warning? Or just all- both of them?

Okay. Yeses on both of them.

[Speaker 1]
I assume they're both daggers of warning.

[Speaker 3]
They are not, just one is. Oh. The other one's like a plus one or something, I don't know.

I don't remember. So, reward-wise? Are you gonna put that in Session Reports?

[Speaker 1]
I am, you guys did find some good shit.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 5]
And then I will clean up my notes and post uh, post the thing. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I am- Are we all done?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we're done, pretty much. The troll is not sure how to get out of the hole, but I think Para has a teleport that she could probably use.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, folks. I am gonna go to bed. I'm super tired.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait, uh, XP. You guys get 4200 XP apiece.

[Speaker 5]
4200 apiece.

[Speaker 3]
I keep trying to, like, just enter it in. Stop grabbing my lip.

[Speaker 5]
No, that seems wrong. 4200 does seem excessive.

[Speaker 3]
Nope, it's here.

[Speaker 1]
There's gonna be a lot of consequences for this.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
I'm offsetting those consequences with proportional reward.

[Speaker 5]
I love consequences. Oh, that wasn't as much as I thought it was gonna be.

[Speaker 3]
I know, I'm almost leveled up. That's sad. I'm really close.

Aww.

[Speaker 2]
I'm dying to know what the consequences are.

[Speaker 4]
Somebody's probably dying.

[Speaker 3]
We're gonna have a lot of splitting to do. Do we have to wait until the next session or will you tell us now?

[Speaker 1]
Some of the consequences are that... Let's see here.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we can do my quest anymore.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, which one is that?

[Speaker 5]
Find the queen's diary and her sister's body and then return the sarcophagi to each.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we kind of changed the reality of that one. Yeah. But, I mean, last time we dealt with a haunt, it turned out that we had gone on a quest to the same place for a different issue and we still got paid.

So, I'm sure it'll work itself out. The universe loves to pay us what we deserve.

[Speaker 4]
Whether that be good or bad. Alrighty, you guys. Well, let's hope we didn't fuck over too many people.

Especially our dragon friend.

[Speaker 1]
That's the fun part. Most of the timeline is getting reset. Again, insofar as just the family tree is concerned.

But the dragon is unaffected by this and is still aware of everything that happened. So the dragon is... King Singvir is like, hey, what the fuck is up with my dragon?

[Speaker 2]
The dragon knows about timeline B? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It does. It is the one that actually told you guys about this haunt.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Oh, that's really weird.

[Speaker 1]
Certain supernatural creatures are not affected by... Similar to how you guys did not lose your memories of timeline A, certain supernatural creatures are not going to... are not necessarily privy to...

[Speaker 2]
Affected by?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, not as much. It's at different degrees, but if you take an adult dragon chances are they're going to be... They're going to maintain their awareness.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, that's not at all funky. For once, I'm not the sleepiest person at the end of a session. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to take like a five minute break so I can grab some extra food, but I'm still going to be on if anybody wants to discuss consequences.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I totally want to hear more consequences. I love consequences.

[Speaker 1]
But those of you who are getting off, thank you for playing. I always enjoy hanging out with you.

[Speaker 3]
Bye.

[Referee (James)]
Use the recording, set current date. Perfect, perfect. All right, I'm ready to go.

How's everybody doing today? Pretty good. Yes, pretty good.

Yep. All right, so we are gathered here today.

[(Nessie)]
No, that's been 10 years. I'm good.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I was going to mention it does sound like the start of like a wedding ceremony.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I already did that 10 years ago. I'm good.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so that's not the start of a wedding ceremony. I did that 10 years ago. I'm fine.

That's not how you start a wedding ceremony. An anniversary, sure.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
So we are gathered here today. We're gathered here today to discuss and do Zephain's Ballad. I believe the intention is actually to do Zephain's Ballad as opposed to stop him from doing it.

Yeah. Which is delightful. This will advance the frost somewhat, but as you are soon to find out, it also does quite benefit even the technical enemies.

The Hyboreal Court doesn't want everything to be dead. Of course, they do value portals. You know, they're necessary.

They're not people like the Fey are people, always, depending on their success, but you know.

[Mech]
Good tools are nice to have around. They're even better than tools.

[Referee (James)]
Delightful pets? Yeah, like prize cattle, you know.

[Mech]
Surfs? No, cattle.

[Referee (James)]
Depending on who you ask, it goes up and down. Some of them might value pets more than they value other people. I believe, how did this all start?

Nessie, was it you who originally sent a letter to him?

[(Nessie)]
Yes. According to her, they're pen pals, so she just sends him letters.

[Referee (James)]
I like it. I think you sent him like a care package.

[(Nessie)]
Yes, also that.

[Referee (James)]
That's delightful. And then what was the last time that you guys interacted?

[(Nessie)]
Um, in person, Citron's party.

[Referee (James)]
Hmm, that sounds about right. I think everybody broke into the wine cellar.

[(Nessie)]
Uh, no, just Mimosa and Zephain. He gave her, they drank his best wine and then Zephain gave her Citron's flying carpet.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that's right. That's how we got that flying carpet. I was like, I knew that we got one from, like, Dina Reese had a flying carpet, and then I couldn't remember if anybody else had.

I knew that we did have other flying carpets, but I didn't know where we got them.

[(Nessie)]
And then they bonded, they drunk bonded, and so she went, okay, you're a friend now, whether he likes it or not.

[Referee (James)]
Classic. I do like that. So, as far as the fan spell goes, go ahead, and I would like somebody to start making history checks or arcana checks, some other check that we think is relevant.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Do we have smart people?

[Mech]
Oh, I have a plus nine to arcana.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, cool. I could probably do a history too. Do you want just one?

[Mech]
Probably one per type of check or skill. I will use guidance for my arcana. Oh god.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Heart, did you bring a smarty?

[Kamon (Heart)]
You know, it is a more social one, so I wasn't planning on bringing them.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, that's fine. I have a plus five on my history that I was gonna see about rolling, and I just wanted to see if you had someone who was smarter than my minus one para.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, yeah, no, because it's a social one, I don't have a very smart person on me. That's fair. I have a plus six to arcana, and that's about it, because my history's a plus four.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right, I'll roll my history and just see what we get. Okay.

[Mech]
Okay, pretty good.

[Referee (James)]
So, the boundaries of fame. I mean, obviously, the Hyboreal Court is missing from the value, but some records still survive. It's primarily in the mode of the different balance that were active and through fairy tales, literally handed down over the generations, just little stories about how if Saint Nick can't make it to, uh, Saint Nick can't.

Now, Christmas has not been celebrated in the valley, uh, properly for a period of time. It's mostly just treated as another, mostly just treated as like another, another holiday, but the fairytale goes that if, if Saint Nick is unable and having trouble, some versions, it's just vain privilege to do this in the valley. It's to hand out presents, hot chocolate, uh, deliver good tidings to all throughout the valley, and to distribute, uh, little lost.

This is the key point, to distribute things that have been lost or forgotten back to the valley. Cool. Yep.

Does this by starting at the valley's, starting at the valley's northern end, until he wraps around, kind of, kind of does a, yeah, like he'll start at, he'll start at Cherus, pretty much, and the northern, some of the northern settlements, he'll go through Cherus, and then he'll go back around until he finishes up at a Druid Grove.

[Speaker 7]
A what grove?

[Referee (James)]
A Druid Grove. Druid? Oh, thank you.

Now, the way that we're going to get started is, um, the Fane is going to open a portal to Cherus Keep, probably? It's a wall called Keep, and a messenger will spring forth. It's a, it is a winter sylvan, so he looks like he's not doing so hot in the presently unfrosted, uh, area of Cherus Keep, but he's happy to, he's happy to be a short message.

He's kind of wasting away here, just standing at it, but there's the Fane's ready to begin his ballad, if, if those who requested may be present or ready to attend.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Of course, of course.

[Referee (James)]
Let's go. This way, this way.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We just grab some random people and go through.

[(Nessie)]
Yes, yes, of course, okay, you and you, let's go, let's go.

[Referee (James)]
Probably a few adventurers at the, at Wolfcall of Keep who are like, it's a Fane, it's a Fane! Like, get up in arms.

[(Nessie)]
No, no, no, no, no, not this time.

[Referee (James)]
I'm assuming that you guys just, like, run through the portal and maybe grab, like, three extra people as you're going. People who are just, like, coming over to, like, look at the portal, or just kind of check out the commotion, just get dragged through. So, you are taken into a cozy, surprisingly warm, it's, you can feel the chill on your skin, but your internal temperature does not change at all, and there's something that looks like fire off in the corner of this room, in a fireplace, but just giving off no heat itself, but again, everybody who's inside this castle is just, you have this internal sense of warmth, even though you're very outside, if your skin is somewhat numb. It is, it looks like a typical cottage, this particular room that you're in, except it has a very large bed, um, and all of the material around here, the more you look at it, you see that the floor is not itself wood, but just kind of like an auburn or, like, tawny colored flavored ice that's been very carefully carved to look like wood, and it's the case for the table, it's the case for the cutlery counters, the nightstands next to the bed, the bed itself. Oh, that's cool.

And snow sitting there, and there's a chandelier.

[(Nessie)]
I mean, okay, guys, this is really beautiful, do we really want to fight against the frost?

[Referee (James)]
I'm kidding. Well, hopefully we'll all have less reason to do so after today. Zephain strides in, ill-fitting red coat that's been clearly borrowed from someone else.

[(Nessie)]
I came prepared, she puts on, she gives him a Santa hat.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, that is so nice. He never wants to come up with the actual hat. He did have it this time, so you could, you could wear it.

Okay. The real red cap.

[Mech]
I probably could have used my two treasures from my staff to cast Barclaycan before all this mess. That's totally fine.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so, thing comes in, it's very, uh, Zephain is actually shorter than some of the other fey that you, that you, his current form is probably at about, probably at about like, even seven feet tall.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I think he glitched out there.

[Referee (James)]
Oops, sorry about that. Zephain's form is at an even seven feet tall.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't think Para and Mimosa notice.

[(Nessie)]
No, I was gonna say, I don't think everybody's- We're still looking straight up his nose.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. He's just like, come on, did you get a haircut or something? Can't tell.

It was probably this hair.

[Referee (James)]
No, Zephain's getting ready, he's like, well, I have finally accumulated a little bit. This has been going on long enough that I can finally get to my bed. And I'm feeling quite well today, so Christmas is going to come a little bit earlier than ever since the previous plan.

[(Nessie)]
Well, everybody lives in early Christmas.

[Referee (James)]
So the plan for today is, you know how the frost has been unbearably chilly? Unfortunately, there's been quite a few mortal deaths in mid-June, just on account of the freezing cold. It's been quite hard for them, especially for some of the settlements that we've frozen over.

They've been struggling more than average. But, but, at this point, I don't think that's going to be a major concern anymore. I don't, I do think that we'll be able to.

The plan will be good. Notice, are all of you comfortable at the moment?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Nobody freezing over from the inside?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Not from the inside. No.

[Referee (James)]
Not that I know of. Excellent. This feeling of warmth and general comfort is what we're going to blanket the entire valley with.

Nobody is going to have to work. Spontaneously for Christmas. On top of that, I have a pretty good basket of goodies here to start handing out.

Obviously, the way my pallet goes, or the way I think it used to work, in quite a long time, is I had, I would have several different bags that I would choose from, and I got one of them from Tiesinger, and then I would bring one of my own, and then I'd, I'd usually be, yes, I'd be gifted one somewhere along the way, and that was, that was usually quite excellent. I appreciated that kind of, oh, there we go. It's pretty frustrating, but, um, so I give out different gifts from different bags, and I would, I mean, in the, in the old days, it would change what kind of people got added to the court, but nobody's been added to this porch in a long time, so I think my pallet this time around, I think it's going to affect, yeah, I think it's going to affect what kind of, he looks like he's just kind of, like, struggling intensely, like, it's not really me who's struggling to speak right now. He just kind of keeps having, like, this internal timer, this internal loop.

It looks like he's shorting a circuit inside of his head, right? Just going blank stare every five seconds and way through a sentence.

[(Nessie)]
Are you okay?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, yes, yes. I was just trying to, I, maybe I'll just start picking from the bags at random and see what happens. Or you can assist me with it.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, I would love to assist. Oh, I've been so excited.

[Referee (James)]
I do remember having elders.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What do you need us to do?

[Referee (James)]
So, I can't remember what these bags are going to, are actually going to produce when we start giving gifts from this. I don't know where I'm going to find the next bag, but I think I will have enough to just kind of distribute pretty much everywhere. And so, just go ahead and pick something from the bags.

I always need to do at least one from each bag. No, I need to do at least two from each bag. Two gifts from each bag need to be deposited somewhere.

But just keep an eye out. Just use your best judgment. I'm going to keep an eye on the road and keep an eye on the air.

Did I do this by, by or by, what did I do last time? Ah, I'll find out once the carriage starts. We'll figure it out.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, we'll figure it out. It's okay.

[Referee (James)]
Let me actually start that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oops, I might have put it in general.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, I think you did put it in general. That's fine.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I was so excited about putting the hot chocolate, but I forgot.

[Referee (James)]
All right, there we go. So, he has a bag of his own that's been borrowed. And then he has a bag from, yeah, so he has the bag from St. Nick. And then he has a bag of its own in a red carriage outside, which he takes and then starts transporting to a blue carriage made of ice and such that made of the same icy material and same carving, same style that you guys saw in St. Well, you now know to be his private quarters inside of his palace. Sort of makes it a palace and castle there. You guys are presently in a courtyard of sorts.

It's appropriate for launching yourselves. It has enough runway, effectively, to take either one of these carriages outside. The faint whistles, motions for everybody to get inside the carriage.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, and this is already in there. She's so excited.

[Referee (James)]
It's perfect.

[(Nessie)]
It's one of those, he gets it and looks and she's already there like, okay, let's go.

[Referee (James)]
Some of you have been to the Cloud Forest, so you will recognize the elk that have those glowing, really patchy kind of throats. I don't know how to, like, really skin those. I don't know the technical term for this.

Elks have a pouch under the throats that when they screamed, it would disperse some of the local fog and mist from the Cloud Forest. I think a few of you have actually witnessed this personally. Now, but for those of you who haven't, they're just striped elk that have very interesting kind of snowflake-shaped horn.

Did I say horn? Yeah, kind of like snowflake-shaped horns. I am so striped.

I am so striped. Get more water and, like, get up and run for a second to get this excess energy out.

[(Nessie)]
It's all good.

[Referee (James)]
It's going to fly down, rest in front of the carriage, and you see ropes and bridles and such just kind of appear along these creatures. You see a sylvan appear next to the fan. He's like, okay, should we go?

He did it without being seen. Should we go now? You weren't supposed to turn un-invisible.

You were supposed to stay invisible, so they thought the rings and bridle just appeared out of nowhere. You jinxed me. Just go.

Go. Go back. You go.

All of you, go. You see a bunch of disappointed sylvans turn un-invisible. A drop in visibility next to the elks.

[Kamon (Heart)]
He's so delightful. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
So there's two bags inside of the cart right now. I'm not even going to look at those at the moment. I'm just going to figure out...

I'm just going to start planning my route, find how many places I'd like to go to. This is the moment in which I mentioned to you folks, hey, by the way, if anybody needs to leave early or something like that, it's totally fine, but you could also just kind of vote to close it out early. If you'd like.

By saying, all right, we've done enough. We're going to close out the ballot.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Cool, cool.

[(Nessie)]
Unless it looks like she'd probably go until all the bags are empty.

[Mech]
Rowan is just observing carefully. He's also trying to pay attention to any of the plant life.

[Referee (James)]
Inside the courtyard, it's primarily ferns that are, again, composed of ice. And then there's a fern species that it looks like a fern. Let me clarify here.

It looks like a fern. It has the same wavy kind of structure and branches to it, but it has pine needles instead of weeds proper.

[Mech]
Hmm. Each one of them just looks like a fan of pine needles. Okay.

My reason why I'm doing that is solely when I get to a high enough level to get transport via plants, I can act as a taxi for people. Good way of getting cash.

[Referee (James)]
All right. Is everybody ready to begin?

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Referee (James)]
Yep. Perfect. You guys will exit the road at the northern end of the map.

Starting off in the ground, there is a large, and when I say large, I mean absolutely massive rock. It's kind of in the center of the ground. It looks frozen over.

There's ice covering it. If you stare at it for too long, your vision starts to shake and bend. It's like looking through two pairs of glasses.

Glasses that weren't meant for dry, specific glasses. And there's little auroras that just kind of erupt out of the ground. I don't feel great over this way, most likely.

I need everybody here to make me an intelligence saving throw.

[(Nessie)]
No, why?

[Referee (James)]
What?

[(Nessie)]
Why do you always do this to me?

[Kamon (Heart)]
Because he knows it's the one that we can't save again.

[Mech]
I can.

[Kamon (Heart)]
The one time I don't bring in an intelligence-based person. Okay.

[Mech]
Oh no, I might not be able to.

[(Nessie)]
Ah. If it's for me, I'm- Now you get to change names.

[Mech]
Can I play Guidance?

[Referee (James)]
How long does Guidance last?

[(Nessie)]
I love that it's 1 plus minus 1 plus 5.

[Referee (James)]
I think you already made your check, though. Yeah, that's a shame.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is this for, like, charm-related reasons or something? Because a 1 definitely does not pass.

[Mech]
If it's related to charm or frighten, then I would have advantage.

[Referee (James)]
It dies.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Ah, darn. So I can't modify it. That's a shame.

[Referee (James)]
Huh. I have a d100 table. Everybody got the exact same one.

Oh wait, no. Okay, so here's the thing. It's short-term madness.

However, 31 through 40 is the character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear. Oh. Those of you who have some advantage or protection against being frightened, you're good to go.

And for everybody else, you're already fleeing from the source of your fear, which is this comet. Oh, so I'm fine, then. Back in the middle of the ground.

Is Mimosa fine? She starts screaming. Yeah, Mimosa's fine.

[(Nessie)]
I, she's gonna be like, oh, is that a comet? That's really cool. What's that about?

Is that the comet?

[Referee (James)]
Yes, yes. So I have a comet. It's been famous.

I've had it for as long as I've presided over some many, many thousands of years ago. I have always had a comet. And this is my, this is my comet.

I love my comet.

[(Nessie)]
That's really cool.

[Referee (James)]
It's gorgeous. The party members are screaming at the moment next to you. He's like, yes, yes, it is a delightful ride.

He's not even...

[(Nessie)]
I mean, she's asking questions.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, goodness. Mimosa, you is the only person who is able, currently able to stand looking at the comet.

[Mech]
Oh, wait, but didn't you mention the frightened thing? Are you immune to frightened? I have advantage.

You may roll again. So I have a 12. I am probably frightened.

God damn it.

[Referee (James)]
Mimosa, you is the only person who is able, currently able to bear looking at the comet. In between asking questions to Zephain and listening to him over the sound of your friend's excited screams.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's in character because, you know, sure, why doesn't she pass?

[Referee (James)]
You notice the top part of the comet separates.

[Speaker 6]
Wow.

[Referee (James)]
And you notice eight crustacean-like legs kind of support itself, just raise up a little bit in a core or a center of the body that is all just teeth and mouths, some of which snake out and then tree before the top of the comet just kind of plunks back into place.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, she's going to look away from that, be like, oh, it looks real nice.

[Referee (James)]
This is my favorite comet, like I said, attached to it for many thousands of years.

[(Nessie)]
Is it all on its own? Did you know that there's something inside of it like a creature?

[Referee (James)]
A creature? Sure, sure. There's a there's a creature in a sense.

I think that the ballads take on living forms sometimes. And I think I like to think that over so much time, it's really just infused the comet.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, so that's a physical form of your new ballad? The legs and the teeth.

[Referee (James)]
Legs and teeth. I don't really think that would fit. I think it would be a large snowflake or something.

[(Nessie)]
I think your comet has crabs. If you need help with that, I can help. Oh, help with what?

We can help. She'll, everybody can help. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
All right. I assume you're talking about the ballad. I guess forward along the in front of the card at this point is a second is a third bag.

And it's a fan just kind of there without slowing down grabs the bag and push it back over. So now the now you guys actually have three bags inside of your three bags inside of the carriage. And you guys are coming up across a small village.

There we go. It's a yeah, there you go. You guys come across a village here with a lot of it looks like they're recently coming back from a mammoth hunt.

One of the mammoths has actually been captured. One of the one of the baby mammoths has been captured and brought back a bunch of parts with meat and furs and tusks that have been set up along this procession going back into the village. And everybody seems to be relatively, relatively happy, relatively pleased.

I'm going to mark it on the map. I think I need to do this with it's off to this left side here. The thing calls out behind you.

He's like, all right, what are we going to what are we going to throw to them? I can circle around here for a few times, but if you want to make you want to make it to the rest of it. There we go.

We'll have to act quickly. Sorry about that.

[(Nessie)]
They just hunted a mammoth, right?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, well, let's get some stuff out of the bags and see what they get.

[Kamon (Heart)]
What color is each bag again?

[Referee (James)]
I was just about to say, so each bag is red, but they're all slightly different shades of red. But more importantly, the they have different trim on them. So the one with this one with gold trim, that's a thing took from Saint Nick earlier.

It's one with kind of a kind of greenish like holiday. Yeah, like a holiday green kind of trim, Lincoln green. Then finally, there's one that's blue.

That's the one that you guys picked up outside of the car.

[(Nessie)]
What was the first color? Sorry. Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
That's the one that's the original bag.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, I'm just writing it down. Yeah. Gold's from Mr. Saint Nick himself. Green is the other one and blue is the one outside the comet. The one with the crustacean legs.

[(Nessie)]
And we just got the green one, you said?

[Kamon (Heart)]
What would be a good gift for hunters? And there was a mention earlier about how we need to deliver at least two from each bag. So just keep that in mind.

[(Nessie)]
Whoopsies. I don't think I did that in the wrong trap.

[Mech]
Hmm.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, no, it does it automatically.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's cool. Okay. Okay, let's toss some from the...

[Mech]
Oh, green. If we got green by the hunters.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think green was the one that Zephain actually had.

[Mech]
Oh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What?

[Mech]
I was just like looking in the out of character chat.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah. Zephain already had it. I thought that's the one we just got.

[Referee (James)]
So blue is the one from the comet. Green is the one that Zephain brought on his own. Oh, okay, okay, okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
But I do still think we're just going to grab from the green. Why not? We'll see what comes out.

[Referee (James)]
You're looking inside the green. It is care packages. There's all these little tins.

They're not made out of tin. For obvious reasons that your grandmother used to keep sewing needles in. There are steaming mugs of hot chocolate inside that have not been...

No matter which way like you move them, they're steaming. No matter which way you move them, they don't like fall apart. Like the liquid doesn't fall out.

It's just a bunch of chocolate, but the liquid itself is not like actually moving out of the These are wonderful.

[(Nessie)]
I must get these mugs. Um, okay, that's...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Obviously, we have to give them that.

[Mech]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, can we look in all of the bags before making a decision? Yeah.

[Mech]
Rowan will look in the gold bag during...

[Referee (James)]
Well, inside the gold bag is all of the magic items that people have forgotten about or not used.

[Mech]
Um, during this, can someone look in the blue bag?

[(Nessie)]
I'll look in the blue bag since it was the comet one.

[Referee (James)]
All right, go ahead and make me another with some saving throws. I'm sorry, intelligence saving throw.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Mech]
Guidance.

[(Nessie)]
You're giving me guidance?

[Mech]
If it's from the comet, my character probably will have guessed. Oh, outer terror probably should help with that. It's reasonable.

[(Nessie)]
What does guidance do?

[Mech]
1d4.

[(Nessie)]
I'll give you a 1d4. Okay, cool. There it is.

There it is.

[Mech]
All right, so I have a funny feeling we're probably... We should probably go for either green or gold then. But mostly it just looks like snowballs.

Okay.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, huh.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, all right, care package. We can check again later.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I was just gonna ask someone else to look in there.

[Mech]
We'll throw some of the stuff from green.

[(Nessie)]
She's gonna... Like the open bag, she's gonna flash it to Rowan and be like, what do you see in here?

[Mech]
Ah. Sorry, Rowan.

[Referee (James)]
Gonna make an intelligence saving throw.

[Mech]
Probably be fair, just like, oh, shit. I'm sorry. Just guidance.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, I know...

[Referee (James)]
You would make it anyways, good news. What do you see? Just barely, by the way.

If I take out the guidance, you'd just barely make it. This one's not...

[(Nessie)]
I bet you made it.

[Referee (James)]
This sounds... This one's not with advantage, but eh, whatever. Well, it threatened, because...

Right, remember, the intelligence saving throw is not against the Brighton condition, it's just sometimes that is a result that can come up. Oh, okay. Oh, sorry.

Okay, so you look inside and you see things that look like they're made out of snow and ice, kind of compacted together, but a few of them have little eyes that just kind of open every once in a while. And the iris of each of these looks like an egg that just has like that... Ever seen an egg with two yolks in it?

Ah.

[Speaker 7]
Ah.

[Referee (James)]
It kind of looks like an hourglass, almost, inside these things, like this sickly yellow...

[Mech]
So Rowan, after seeing that he's just gonna, you know, put down the blue bag, it's just like, we're gonna go for the green, I'll tell you on the way to the next patch. She's just gonna be like, yeah, I figured. We have to do at least two from each bag.

Yes, agree for this bunch.

[(Nessie)]
Well, don't worry, we'll get it, but not this stop. She'll close it and she'll give him like a, yeah, I thought it was fucked. So, green bag and, or green trim and gold trim for this one.

[Mech]
For this one, green. Yeah, they went hunting, so.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
All right, you guys are going with the green, so you just start throwing out like, tins of cookies and additional mugs of hot chocolate. The people of this town have a little bit more of like a greenish or blue hue to them. As they're going around and they have little like, tusk teeth here.

And they all get really fucking excited because there's just like, good's right raining down and you see them go absolutely feral over this hot chocolate.

[Mech]
Like Black Friday at Walmart?

[Referee (James)]
Pretty much, pretty much. No, no, well, nobody dies in the process. Each time they like, they go to like, clink their drinks together, another mug of hot chocolate appears to somebody else nearby.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, I need to know this one. This, this makes her little mark of hospitality halfling heart happy.

[Referee (James)]
Everything's operating on Polar Express rule.

[(Nessie)]
Yes, yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So.

[Kamon (Heart)]
On we go.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Para's going to slap everyone with an intelligence enhance ability.

[Referee (James)]
That's a good idea. This is a really good idea. But all right.

Then somebody go ahead and make you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I can do it. Where's perception? Perception.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You got it in the bag. One person to do it. Oh.

It's like, well, I can do that. That's good. Nice.

[Referee (James)]
So, yeah, we'll say Para and Rowan, you guys notice that there's Bonzo Finn's crown, which is made of these orange and blue and a few green gems as well. Basically, the colors of hearths, of auroras and of, and of the Evergreens. It's a pine tree.

Interesting. Looks like one of the gems starts, like, getting slightly smaller on his side. And then, Kalman, you notice as this happens, he just kind of starts twisting a little bit.

A little slump for a second periodically. Almost like he's being put to sleep or can't keep himself conscious. And then he's able to shake himself off and shake it off for a little bit.

And this goes back to normal.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I lean to Mimosa and be like, your friend looks a bit off. Is it normal for him to lose grounds of consciousness? I'm sorry, what?

What's happening? Um, it seems that every so often he seems to, to, uh, you know, slump over and feel a little tired. Is it not, is that his normal constitution?

Or should we be concerned?

[(Nessie)]
It's not normal, but shush and keep your eyes peeled, please.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. Okay, I'm just like, patsy on the shoulder. Shush.

[(Nessie)]
And honestly, whether it was normal or not, she would have still said that. Keep an eye on him, please. Like, let me know.

He is driving. When you notice it's happening. Yes, also that, but make notes of when it happens.

[Referee (James)]
The next area I go to is this little ring of mountains that I believe Corgan marked on your, Corgan marked on your map ages ago. I mean, ages ago. Why is that marked as...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, before I even got here.

[Referee (James)]
It was like, literally like the first, I want to say the first couple of sessions that this happened. So it was back, like it was still 2022. I think, um, you guys...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Why are there so many Mimosa's towers?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so I think they changed some of like, the possible sun shrine descriptions. I changed the one to Mimosa's towers, and then it said a bunch of things, too.

[(Nessie)]
Mimosa is going to be the actual big bad evil guy, and she's going to take over. They'll sit there under the wire.

[Mech]
This is funny, considering my plans to eventually set up a reincarnation cartel. So, goes over to...

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, there we go. And takes you guys to this, um, this time the elks are actually flying. Once you make it off the shelf, right, of mountains that kind of surrounds the maids, and the glacier at the very north, not the one that's growing between the spires, but the actual kind of like glacier ice shelves.

He does just continue flying off at kind of the same altitude where everybody's now flying at the same altitude as the ice shelf was. You guys can see below you red-haired fire and like black-skinned giants working and toiling beneath a large spout of lava, smithing away, building weapons, war machines, and jewels.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Um, should we give them the magical items?

[Mech]
Yeah, I think gold would be good here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. Do you want to just deposit the blue ones here? Be a bit mean, but we do have to put them somewhere.

[(Nessie)]
Is there hope that the giants can kill them?

[Kamon (Heart)]
I mean, they are, they do.

[Mech]
Convenient access to weapons, lots of lava.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, they're snow, ice creatures, right? If we dump them in the fire zone...

[(Nessie)]
Is there a way we can stealthily attack, like put them in a bag, attack on a message that's like, kill these? Kill these, please.

[Referee (James)]
Sure.

[(Nessie)]
All right, so we'll drop... These are our first victims. Yes.

It's a little note that's like, apologies, please kill these.

[Mech]
A night of wonder and terror indeed.

[(Nessie)]
We are giving them creatures, but we are also giving them magical items. Maybe that'll help, I don't know.

[Mech]
Right. Right, we can give them...

[(Nessie)]
One bag per player. Oh, one bag. Okay, never mind, then just give them the bugs.

Or the nobles, excuse me.

[Mech]
They're probably best able to deal with it. If it looks like anybody's gonna look in the blue bag again, I'm gonna be casting Bless on them.

[(Nessie)]
If Mimosa did it, she wouldn't be looking. She'd just reach in and grab. And just be like, it's a snowball.

It's a snowball. It's a snowball.

[Referee (James)]
I'm trying not to feel...

[(Nessie)]
Huh?

[Referee (James)]
To you, it just looks like a snowball.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, yeah, she knows it's not. I mean, she knows it's something else, and she kind of has a guess, but she doesn't know at all. But the fact is, is it's not a snowball.

So she's just going, it's a snowball. Tell her, it's a snowball.

[Mech]
Yeah. Yeah, your character probably saw Rowan's react, just like...

[(Nessie)]
Well, in Mimosa's mind, she saw the comet. And then he said it was snow. And so she's like, oh, this is also snow.

It's probably awful. She doesn't know what it is, but she knows it's awful. That's where she's going.

[Referee (James)]
What kind of message do you put on there?

[(Nessie)]
Um... Apologies, please kill this. Apologies, please kill these.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, there we go.

[Mech]
Please kill these. Or just, or just alternatively, just put apologies.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, okay. No, no, no, no, the gifts.

[Mech]
The classic gift.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Specify being like... Happy, happy holidays.

[(Nessie)]
We're sorry.

[Mech]
We trust that you're the best handlers for this.

[Referee (James)]
I think just... Grumbling up front. Happy holidays.

It's Christmas.

[(Nessie)]
Sorry, sorry. We're so terribly sorry.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, we celebrate Christmas up here. Yes.

[Mech]
All right. Blue bat. Blue, blue it is for this.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Yeah.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We wouldn't want to go... We wouldn't want to end up with the blue bag last and we end up in some poor defenseless town or something.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, no, I believe in being strategic with these. That's fine.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, Para's gonna watch the crown on Zephain.

[Referee (James)]
The green gem actually gets, that you saw diminished earlier, gets restored. And Zephain looks like a little bit more alert. He actually kind of like sits up in his seat like he's got a burst of energy.

Um, okay. Truth is valid wise. This is why it was so critical for me.

Terrible as it was, you know, nobody wants to waste any life. Well, terrible as this initially was, it was so important to get my work back for, you know, their return at a season in some way. We've all just kind of been wasting away for a thousand years.

I don't have a fairness to point to, but I'm happy that here... Kind of slips back into his previous method of... His previous habit of short-circuiting.

All right, so next location comes along. He is at a dwarf hold down here. The hold of Clan Hothgar.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, that's where Dwarf Friend was from, right?

[Referee (James)]
It is.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, we can give them the magic stuff. They'll appreciate the whippings.

[Mech]
Everybody likes magic items. Unless they're cursed, of course.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Of course.

[Mech]
Yeah, but I trust that anything found in the gold bag should be good.

[Referee (James)]
All right, and you guys just throw down... Just throw down some magic items from the original place there.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Okay, yep.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And once again, Para's watching to see what happens.

[Referee (James)]
This one, go ahead and... I guess this one's going to be Perception... Wait, no, no.

I'll let one person make a Perception check. I'll let one person make an Arcana check.

[Mech]
All right, I'll do Arcana, then.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, I'll do Perception. That's Medicine.

[Mech]
I wish I could use my Medicine so bad, but I don't.

[Referee (James)]
Medicine would probably, yeah... Medicine would also be fine here, actually.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, damn, girl!

[Referee (James)]
It's fine, I got a 30.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'll never get to use my Medicine. It's my highest skill.

[Speaker 6]
Have fun, then.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, who did the Arcana? Me. All right, Rowan.

You looked over, and you look off the side, and where you guys kind of drop these magic items or dispatch them, there are Dwarf Sentries there. They look pretty excited about what's going on, a little bit cautious, but, you know, cautiously optimistic as they're investigating. You notice that an invisible portal has formed right next to the hole.

[Mech]
Is that portal supposed to be there? It's just like, I'm saying audibly, like, out loud.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, yes, we would, you know, we would engage in the wild hunt shortly after. Shortly after the battle. Or sometimes it would be before.

It depends. But it was a little bit easier to manage when it came to, if we did it after my battle, we would go on the wild hunt, visit places, you know, kill monsters.

[Mech]
I enjoyed it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's what it does. So the portal here is specifically to help with monsters, or? Okay.

[Referee (James)]
And then, Pera, you notice that these general, I shouldn't say, silly. There are patches on his skin that indicate, like, some kind of discoloration and some general, like, sickliness. The Fae usually don't get sick.

Not like people do, at the very least. They don't adopt human diseases or mortal diseases. But they can waste away.

And you notice one of these patches of discoloration, just glow gold for a second, and then fade away, and it looks brand new.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh.

[Mech]
Okay. So we're restoring.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
His liver spots are going away.

[Mech]
Yeah, they do look like liver spots.

[Referee (James)]
But, like, if you applied it to somebody who was sick.

[Mech]
Interesting.

[Kamon (Heart)]
This is a very concerning group of symptoms, but currently it's not, like, major enough we can do anything about it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, I think we are doing something about it, based on, you know, what choices we make.

[Mech]
But, yeah, like, on the way to the next place, Rowan's gonna, like, start, you know, mentioning what he saw in the bag. The blue bag. And how does he describe it?

Like you mentioned, like, snowballs, eyes, and legs, right?

[Referee (James)]
So, like, it looks misshapen, oblong, compared to the snowballs that Mosa was looking at. Yeah, it's the eyes, the little kind of rocky bits inside of them.

[Mech]
They look like something was pretending to be snowballs, but really badly. Or, like, something was trying to mimic.

[(Nessie)]
That's lovely.

[Referee (James)]
How's everyone doing back there? Does anybody need to use the restroom? Thank you.

The Silver Falls, you know, I don't know if Tenadum's going to be super happy to see me at the moment. I imagine I probably should turn away.

[(Nessie)]
Uh, do you think he'll fire at you if we just do a quick drive-by?

[Referee (James)]
It might be. He might view it as rude, is the problem.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Um, who is it that would not be happy to see if I didn't catch the name? Tenadum.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, I don't know if you were there for his ballad, but that's where Mimosa picked up the planet.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I was not. I don't believe.

[Mech]
Meanwhile, this is my first ballad I'm getting to take part of.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Hmm. Can I insight to see if I would know if, um, or is that just not a thing we need to know?

[Referee (James)]
We know. This is a perfect spot for using your skill checks. Do you want to persuade him to give you the Silver Falls?

Do you want to persuade him to go pay him?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, I was thinking insight to see if like I would know if Tenadum would be mad.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Like the guy the month is named after.

[Referee (James)]
Ah. So as far as whether or not he would be mad, that's a good question. Based on what you know of Fate Politics so far, there's a little bit of a faux pas about a now, you know, coming over.

If you're not going to attack somebody, and if you're not at a party, there's, it's a little bit of a faux pas to just kind of like show up on somebody's doorstep. And there's also awkward, uh, feeding it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well. I don't know. I mean, yeah, they should follow Fey rules.

[(Nessie)]
Probably we could only, I mean, if we really want to, we can leave something on their doorstep, like at the borders.

[Referee (James)]
I mean, that's the same thing. Oh, it's okay. It's okay to start speeding up too.

The only city that you guys have not been to in some areas so far. Little city. Yeah, the only city I see an arrangement of spires and towers and literal height, like spiderwebbed highways networks across several different cities.

It's like a metroplex, basically. And this is where Orville was originally from. And recently, just the name.

This is Terramist, the Doppelnoid city was made. Okay, I'm confident that these people dislike me. But I feel obligated.

I feel like they deserve a little bit of Christmas as well. It's just, I don't want to put anybody in danger.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We can pick what we're going to put down first. That way it's a little faster.

[Mech]
Yeah. I mean, I have Augury, so I'm in.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, I...

[Mech]
For really unsure.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
My vote is give them hot chocolate. Yeah.

[Mech]
Yeah, all right. Yep. Green bag it is, then.

[(Nessie)]
Something nice.

[Mech]
Okay. I guess I'll save my Augury in reserve for when we really need it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Dear God, is this a bad decision?

[Mech]
All right, man, I'll spam it for this one. Like, do whatever divinations and such you'd like. Oh, funnily enough, I do actually have divination prepared.

[(Nessie)]
I mean, if we want to do that, then we can.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. You can ask about it. Yeah, go for it.

Should we dump the spiders on them, or it's a green bag?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think Neil or Will was a yes or no question, but...

[Mech]
Green, gold, or blue?

[Kamon (Heart)]
You can ask if blue would be a better idea.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Nope, he did divination.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You can ask if blue's a better idea, so it's a yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Because this one can be a short phrase, a cryptogram, or an omen. What question regarding this specific goal or event?

[Mech]
Drop gold, green, or blue bag.

[Kamon (Heart)]
When's the best time for that?

[Mech]
Well, I mean, if we're dealing with gods, might as well be direct about it. Don't want to waste any more time. I've been unable to come up with a rhyme.

[Referee (James)]
I got close. I felt it in my bones, but it wasn't quite there. If you drop gold...

So if you drop magic items on this one, it's going to be taken as a challenge for a duel, and probably going to get them really fired up. If you were to drop the eggs, it wouldn't really produce a response either way. Besides, like, just maybe a general feeling of insult, and they would probably just do whatever they were going to do anyways.

If you were to drop the... If you were to drop the green supplies there, they would take it as a sign of truce.

[Mech]
Ah. I'm going to relay this info.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so like, green bag.

[Speaker 6]
Do you want a truce with them?

[Referee (James)]
So long as I'm within range of flack, I should say yes.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right then, green bag. We're spreading holiday cheer. We need everyone to be friends.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We do also have to get rid of these bugs.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, that is true. That is a good point. I mean, if it's a neutral thing...

We don't know what the bugs do yet. All right then, green. Truce it is.

[Referee (James)]
Kind of like, sags down again. And he's jammed, like, the biggest one... It's the biggest one on his crown, which is slightly close, and then it spaces out for a little while.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Are you okay? Are you...

[(Nessie)]
Are you good?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, yes, yes. Just, uh, feeling a little bit, you know, just taking the beauty of it. It's been a while since I've been able to properly survey it.

It has changed... It hasn't changed too much in the past thousand years, I'd say. Most of the big changes we're doing were just a thousand years ago.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I see.

[Referee (James)]
Since then, it's been quite nice. I do... I'm not sure if I miss the floating cities.

[(Nessie)]
You know, I never got to compliment your crown.

[Referee (James)]
It is beautiful. Thank you. I certainly think so.

Severe, sharp, regal, still welcoming. Wanted to put a softer touch to the front, with gems and I think it's a good feeling.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. Would you appreciate Christmas carols on this ride?

[Referee (James)]
Always!

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right. I'll do a performance check for that. Just, like, pulls out an instrument.

Very well, though. And performance, performance. I am modifying that, dear lord.

Oh. Yep, nope, I'm changing that. There we go, it's a 33 now.

This is going to be the best song you've ever heard. I start off on a bad note, but it's fine.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
By the way, I start off on a note that takes everyone back to their emo phase.

[Mech]
By the way, if anybody wants to make a medicine check at any point, I'm going to be using my pair of remedies to add 48 of my dice. Okay. Enjoy.

[(Nessie)]
Those gems are also very nice.

[Referee (James)]
In fact, you see the, with this, you see the front one, with the big green one at the very top, growing in size. And then, Phineas, I know that you're here, but I cannot, I don't know if you've been talking.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I've not been talking.

[Referee (James)]
I've been studiously creating my Bladesinger import by import, and I'm just about done. I think he's ready. When you looked at a recast, I figured, I was like, oh, he's probably saving that for one of the divination spells.

All right.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, so the green gem grew with the Christmas music. Does he look okay? Does he look more refreshed?

[Referee (James)]
He looks a little bit better, actually.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so like, keep doing that.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. I just, I just give like a nod. Keep strumming.

[Referee (James)]
Any, any kind of like, individual thing that you guys, your individual method you guys see. So like, throw off the results of this later on. We'll, um.

[(Nessie)]
Most is going to make hot chocolate. Once. And she'll pass it out to everybody, by like, zipping.

We'll get a little bit more.

[Referee (James)]
Of course, people will be repeating their ballads. Now for the, uh, about the next season. So maybe he'll.

[Speaker 6]
Okie dokie.

[Referee (James)]
Excellent. Okay, so next up is another Druid Grove at the front end of the valley here. At the front end of this mountain range here.

It's basically a lot, a very large plateau. And it's red, chalky in nature. Most of the trees here are red.

Some of which look a little bit more sinister than others. But plenty of which, you know, look relatively. Red maples.

Cancel. There we go. The fane's looking down and he says, that's a red grove of rard.

It was, uh, I never read rard. But by all accounts, he was a, he was a swell fellow. He was an odd one.

I've never met a bugbear druid.

[(Nessie)]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
That sounds. Why, it's sort of a pretty pleasant place there. I spoke steely.

The rougher ailments in this, these curses sometimes, they can go here and get transformed. No offense there, patron.

[Mech]
Uh, gold then?

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's kind of what I was thinking, yeah. I... Oh, I missed that description.

Can you just, can someone run that by me for a second?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so it's a druid grove. It's surrounded by red. This entire mountain range, or this entire plateau really, is red and chalky.

The grove itself is oak.

[Speaker 7]
Thank you.

[Referee (James)]
You see what looks to be like a large structure at the very top that kind of looks like a chrysalis. And very center of this grove. People go there to get cured various ailments, but I don't think as many people go there.

Especially, nobody really has to, besides the red. But they haven't had to really swallow the substance.

[(Nessie)]
Um... I just had a kooky thought. Could we give them...

from the blue bag with a note that's like, can you please tell us what this is? We'll come back. Since they're good with like dealing...

I don't know. They seem like researchers or smart people.

[Mech]
Like, my idea for this, like, we could just give gold here and then go back to the place we passed over earlier and give blue there.

[(Nessie)]
The place we passed would probably make it worse because they're already shooting.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And it's one bag per place. So we could ask them what on earth these creatures are. They are...

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, we can make a note to come back or jot down the place and go back and see if they can research it. Yeah.

[Mech]
All right.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Mech]
Okay, I guess we're doing blue.

[(Nessie)]
We'll do blue and a container or something.

[Mech]
Or, you know, I could just do this. Agri, wheel or woe? Oh, to see if they could...

[Referee (James)]
What's the action that you guys are going to be taking? Like, commit to what you're trying to do. I mean, not commit, but describe what you're trying to do.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I want to give them eggs.

[Mech]
Blue. Would dropping blue give wheel or woe or even both? Was it just that or is it...

[(Nessie)]
They want to... Okay, my idea is we drop the eggs to them with a note that asks them if they can research it or to research it. And then we'll be back to check in and see what they've come up with.

[Kamon (Heart)]
And put them in the little box so they don't escape or something.

[(Nessie)]
Keep them contained.

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right.

[Mech]
You get a wheel. Oh, yeah. Okay, so we're fine then.

All right.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, that's what Mimosa did.

[Mech]
We'll go along with your idea, yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Merry Christmas. Please, please be careful. Please research these.

We will come back for them. Or we'll come back and ask you about them. Payment, if you need it, will be provided.

And then she'll drop it. And she'll sign her name, of course.

[Referee (James)]
We're not even finished with this Christmas yet. And we're already thinking about the next. You must be having fun.

[(Nessie)]
Well, of course.

[Referee (James)]
Gotta be.

[(Nessie)]
You have to be on top of Christmas. Says the mother with five children.

[Referee (James)]
And once again, you see him get like this kind of... There's a slight halo growing around him. Just the faintest, faintest.

[(Nessie)]
Your... I mean, I guess it's obvious. It should be obvious.

Your crown is magical, isn't it?

[Referee (James)]
Indeed. Most of what I carry on is magical. Yeah.

The boat I'm wearing is magical. But it's not mine. There's the bag you're wearing.

Oh, yes. The cloak I have a sword around it. Some...

[Kamon (Heart)]
So the best of us.

[Referee (James)]
But yes, it really is a delight. Her crown is where I invest most of my power. It's the...

How things go as part of a fang. As per your position in court, the daughter is the most of your power and strength. The symbol of your future.

So Vanessa's invests the most into his bow. So Lyle invests the most. Her...

Helmet?

[(Nessie)]
Which I think we still have.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you guys don't have that at all.

[(Nessie)]
Oh. I thought we got the helmet. Oh, no, that's what Rana put on.

Yeah, that's right. Okay. I, for some reason, I just linked on to the sword and forgot that it was Lyle.

So yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, no, no, yeah. Yeah. So Lyle, I don't know what hers would be.

She might be getting a crown of her own soon.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
If we can bring her out of...

[Referee (James)]
Sounds lovely.

[(Nessie)]
Is she one of the ones that went into a coma? Yeah, she got...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
She got canthasia'd.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, canthasia. I hear she's recently set a crown upon her own head. Good for her.

Good for her. She was struggling, Lyle. The system used to be one of those little astronomers tools.

Something that, it was something like sailors, but it was also just like a proper telescope.

[Mech]
I thought it was sextant.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, yes. Except it also had like an actual, you know, it was also proper as a telescope for observational. It's quite the work.

Yeah. I only met her in passing once, but it's nice to see that she's recovered from... Humbled.

I keep getting asked how I adopted what part.

[(Nessie)]
Yes, we just recently did her ballad. For her? With her?

[Referee (James)]
For her? Yeah. That sounds about right.

Hey, you meddle in so many different things around the rally. We should have suspected you. I hope you all had a good time.

[(Nessie)]
It was interesting. There is one person that I do personally need to find. He's got something that I want.

[Mech]
That could help out with that, with divination.

[(Nessie)]
That would be awesome. I want that dagger.

[Kamon (Heart)]
One guy has a knife and I must have it.

[(Nessie)]
It's shiny and cool and I want it.

[Referee (James)]
So, you guys make it back. This area looks rather mundane to you compared to, you know, in Sepphoris and its valleys. But it looks like the rest of the terrain.

There's no disturbances here. It doesn't look like a settlement. And then Zephain waves his hand and you see a cocoon kind of like stretched across the ground there.

Five pixies. He says, this is probably a similar problem. I don't really know.

I actually don't know what Lepiglice is doing right now. I know that she and Theresia were fighting. But I haven't heard...

[(Nessie)]
Who and Theresia?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, Lepiglice? Oh, okay. She's the one who brought all the hobgoblins here.

And the goblins and the bugbears.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So, it's the same problem as...

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, same problem as to not really know. I'm just kind of inclined to explore the other village somewhere at the moment.

[(Nessie)]
That's understandable.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, moving on?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, I guess we are.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I'm going to try and persuade him actually to drop some hot chocolate here. Let's see. Do you want me to help you?

[Referee (James)]
Are you thrown to the side as he turns around? How would you like to persuade him?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Maybe it'll be like a sign of...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Truce-like with the... It's the faux pas thing. It's that faux pas issue.

It's like a weird face thing. It's also his ballot, so I feel like... Yes, but I should also emphasize that he does lose energy and get all...

Dizzy-like when he does anything but blue.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, he doesn't do it on green on the gold, but...

[Kamon (Heart)]
I am playing Christmas music, but it only works so many times.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, damn it, okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
What are other things that you can do that will...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
For any of these modifiers that I'm playing around with right now, there's...

[(Nessie)]
Hot chocolate and sugar cookies with marshmallows sprinkled with peppermint?

[Mech]
Did you bring some of your own?

[(Nessie)]
She always has that.

[Referee (James)]
All right, go ahead and make me a chocolate.

[Kamon (Heart)]
She has a tea set and... Again, we have other places we can go to. You don't have to slightly insult a Fey Lord in order to be nice.

[Referee (James)]
Paris said that she's going to try to convince him. How would you like...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, I was gonna say what we could do...

[(Nessie)]
What you could do to also persuade is we could drop a note that says, hey, we can announce ourselves so we're not doing the faux pas.

[Referee (James)]
This will be an easy DC, so go ahead and...

[(Nessie)]
Was I able to help in that? Because I did offer to help.

[Referee (James)]
Did offer to help with...

[(Nessie)]
Sure. The persuasion, I've got pretty good... Do I roll?

[Referee (James)]
Well, the help action gives para advantage.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. Okay, so I roll again. Yep.

Okay. You just did puppy eyes behind her.

[Referee (James)]
You know what? It might not be seen necessarily as a truce to her, and it's probably still an issue to her specifically, but as I think on it, it probably would be even more rude to offer something to people under her protection, but not offer anything to her. But really, I'm obligated to do something here.

[Speaker 6]
I agree.

[Referee (James)]
So what are you guys actually dropping down there?

[(Nessie)]
A green bag, right?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, do we want to do gold or do we want to do green? I feel like...

[Mech]
She's appeal to their vanity. Go for gold.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, I guess. But we're also giving a lot of... Oh, you know what?

Fine. But they are fake, so they do have their own magic items. Yes, gold.

Yeah, we're doing gold. Okay. Disappears.

[Referee (James)]
And I should note that he has 12.

[(Nessie)]
Both liver spots remaining? Well, let's go!

[Referee (James)]
All right, next place is an elf cairn that's hidden out in the woods here. It stretches over... There we go.

Yeah, can you guys see Requirial Cairn here? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

All right, cool. This is very close to the Pit of the Deep that you guys went into. It was not the Convergence Pits.

Now, the Pit of the Deep is where Rana found... Where Rana treed the Book of Exalted Deeds from the stomach of the Prince of the Deep. The Requirial Cairn here, which is in the middle...

[Speaker 7]
Oh, is it?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, sorry. I have your card. The Requirial Cairn here, which is in the middle of the Cloud Forest.

I haven't been here before. It is a forest where the trees themselves kind of are not shaped like clouds. They're greenery, right?

They're vegetation. The leaves themselves are just cloud stuff. It's kind of a constant, roiling fog that goes across the area.

The Requirial Cairn here is composed mostly of stone. It's literally typical as far as the desert is concerned. But there's a population of Firbolgs and Mephane Explains.

There's also some Firraben, Firbolgs, whatever you call the Mephane Giants. I know that there's an actual hold of Cloud Giants somewhere around here. When I do drop my gifts, I usually drop them here at the Requirial Cairn.

I have no idea. There's a lot of metal down there. It points out to the Requirial Cairn.

Because the final feature of note is there is a giant. I mean a true giant, something titanic in size. At hundreds of feet tall, with a rather large sword through the chest.

Centered perfectly in a hole in the center of the chest. Buried into the ground. Both of these objects, you have the hundreds of feet.

And below is the pit of the deep, which is this kind of geometric... A geometric fractal of metal and blinking light that just goes further and further down the Requirial Cairn that overlooks this.

[Speaker 6]
All right, so...

[(Nessie)]
Gold Bag? Right? I mean, not to give the Cloud Giants more things to kill people with in the Cloud Forest, but...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't think it's the Cloud Giants that we're scared of. Okay, so I'll have to do a divination. Okay.

I have to go to the bathroom. Right.

[Referee (James)]
The hide behind is killing people. There's a cryptid inside this house. Spoiler, there's a cryptid inside this house.

Is the thing that turned to you, it's like, Cloud Giants killing people? Why are they doing that?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, there's a guy... A couple guys, maybe?

[Referee (James)]
Just a regular person?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, they're like... They hide behind stuff. And they're weird and stretchy.

[Referee (James)]
Ever seen a full one? No. Which side of it?

Have you seen anything of it?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think I've seen like a hand grab something and then disappear again.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. What are the... It must be pretty small.

So you're saying you've seen weird and stretchy creatures around here?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, Para's going to do a divination to see... Um... Oh, do we want to?

We could just pick something. Yeah, let's go for gold.

[Mech]
Yep. Gold it is, then.

[Referee (James)]
He knows another one of these spots. All right. Para, go ahead and make me aim.

[Mech]
Remember, you have 48.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Nah, you're fine.

[Mech]
Yep.

[(Nessie)]
You're still messing. Holy shit.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. You look at him and you notice some of the veins... I mean, they are known to be like muscly themselves.

But you just notice he gets a little bit more mass around the arms. Around the neck. Most importantly, you notice a slight change in the color of his veins.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm.

[Referee (James)]
Got a little bit more of it. Again, all burn. Just a slight...

They just glow for a slight second. Keep lovely all burn.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's nice.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Awesome. This particular region, there is...

Sears of Pain. Further down, waves his hand again. And we got...

He's discovered... Another druid grove in the... This is the Lost Boys Redoubt.

Isn't really a... Most of them are actually really not druids. They're just people who come from...

Other places. They're awfully terrible at describing or telling stories. But as far as I can tell, they just come from other worlds.

People who fell through the world.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Like Peter Pan.

[Mech]
I'm thinking green for this.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Hmm.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Just because they're druids, that's a little racist.

[Mech]
No, I mean, if they're down on their luck, might as well give them a bit of cheer, you know? Give, you know? Yeah.

Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, so green to the Lost Boy Druid.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Lost Boy Brigade. Not necessarily druids, but apparently just people who are there.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. Just a lot of people who were here by accident. And as with last time, it's a diminished mental state.

That's right, you guys gave gold to... What was it? It was the Lucky Guys and...

Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
The Cairn, yeah. Yeah.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I've been making the summary and it's already a couple... It's a lot over the... Over the limit you can put it in because of how many details there are.

So I'm just gonna have to sort from it a bit more.

[Referee (James)]
No, don't get rid of the detail, right? Just put multiple messages. I love detail.

All right.

[(Nessie)]
And other people are gonna want to read the details and want to know. They'll read the chunk of words. They'll read the word block.

[Referee (James)]
Especially with some of the detail.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
I always get it. I always feel bad when specific details, especially about like interesting tactical situations, come up and like they just never make it back into the session report. I'm like, oh, but that fight was so cool.

There was such a cool dynamic over here. Just kind of like fades in. That's how most sessions go.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Has the green gem diminished significantly or besides the... Or has the boost from last time like sort of negated that a bit?

[Referee (James)]
Nope. Like I said, the same thing happened last time. The same thing.

So I didn't specify that what happened to it. But yes, I guess the diminished mental state and the gem itself in the front of his crown dimensions.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is it Christmas story time? I feel like it's Christmas story time. Wants to have a nice...

[Mech]
So was that the third green then? Yeah. Yeah.

We're just keeping track.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Should I save the Christmas stories for a bit later if we do another green? So he doesn't pass out when he's running around? Or should I do it now?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah. Does Mimosa have any like milk and cookies? Yeah, she has milk and cookies.

Maybe he needs some milk and cookies too.

[(Nessie)]
She's always got pastry. She's always got candy. She's always got cookies.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Maybe that's why Santa always eats them when he comes and visits.

[Mech]
To stay awake.

[(Nessie)]
She'll pass out cookies.

[Referee (James)]
I need to check with Cook's Utensils.

[Mech]
Oh, okay. Then they'll have 48 instead then because I can do that. Clear your remedies.

[(Nessie)]
I do have Cook's Utensils. Let me get them.

[Mech]
Is this... Is what? You're a Nervalist?

Yeah. Yeah, because I have Barrier Remedies.

[Referee (James)]
This would have been for something basically in Mimosa's downtime that you'd be working with. But, but...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
But Para can do it.

[Referee (James)]
You have the herbs and spices right next to you. Right? Like fresh cinnamons or whatever.

[(Nessie)]
And peppermint. Little peppermint candy pieces.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, good thing I made her get a Habersack.

[Referee (James)]
No, that's not what it is. Yeah, so you would be able to apply the dice to it. Um, as far as using the Cook's Utensils.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, how many dice do I...

[Mech]
I'm giving you 48.

[Referee (James)]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[Mech]
You're gonna roll a d20.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Are you proficient in Cook's Utensils?

[(Nessie)]
I don't think so, but I do have them.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. You can roll with this. Actually, no, add your proficiency bonus to this.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
And which, which statistic do you want to use as like the ability modifier for this?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, Mark of Hospitality does do something with it. Whenever you roll an ability check using Brewer or Cook's Utensils, roll a d4 and add that number. Okay, so I think it put it on wisdom, so.

[(Nessie)]
That's fine. And then is this where I add the d8 if I want to?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, you can say how many of them you're gonna add.

[(Nessie)]
I'm gonna do two.

[Mech]
Oh. Maybe both are bonuses.

[(Nessie)]
I feel like four is gonna be overkill and you can use... Or, no, maybe not. Oh well, 16.

[Mech]
Uh, it looks to raise the spirits a little bit. I do not know why it is doing that for Lucent, but all right. I'm adding my own.

Heh.

[(Nessie)]
Why did it roll me as Knox? That's weird.

[Referee (James)]
Because you're currently selected on him. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mimosa was the one who was deciding on these.

Oh. Oh.

[(Nessie)]
There we go. He got a 16. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, it doesn't really, I mean, it lifts his spirits generally. He seems happy. No effect on the crown, no effect on the...

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, it's the Equine Academy. I don't believe anybody has... I don't believe anybody here has been to.

The Equine Academy looks like a very large... It's built like a very large racing track with several smaller racing tracks on the interior of it, right? It almost looks like a playground.

Some flying mounts or chariots going around. How to ride, how to incorporate magic into combat and such. The Fae looks very pleased with these people.

He's like, I actually got all of these, all of these Elks. I did not get them myself. These were a gift from the Equine Academy.

They don't naturally have that kind of snowflake shape to their horns here, nor the rather vibrant shade of teal that you can see on them. Normally it's a bit of a darker glow, you know, like a dark blue when their screenings kind of disperse these clouds and fog inside of the Cloud Forest. But those modifications were given to the Equine Academy.

I just could not resist.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, should we give them something from the gold bag then to really thank them?

[Referee (James)]
Like a scarab? I have no idea what's in that bag.

[Kamon (Heart)]
But I trust you. You can send me. We did throw it out a bunch of times.

[(Nessie)]
Do you know what's in any of these bags? Do you remember? Or has it always been just a blind throw?

[Referee (James)]
I usually include hot chocolate and cookies and other pastries inside my bag. And I'm pretty sure I remember to bring those along. What Nick gives me is what Nick gives me.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, so you just don't know what's in Nick's bag?

[Referee (James)]
There could be a bomb in there for all I know. There's no bomb.

[(Nessie)]
No, these are all really good, really good presents.

[Mech]
Yeah, let's throw out the gold bag. That which was lost now becomes found.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, then it does make sense to why he's diminished out of his own bag. And then, you know, Nick's bag is like being lent to him. So he only has so many he can give.

Oh yeah, invested. And then the blue is that weird evil comet. We don't talk about that one.

Evil comet? Oh, that sounds despicable. Now that was internal thoughts.

I didn't say it out loud.

[Referee (James)]
You did say it out loud. I just heard you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You can read thoughts?

[(Nessie)]
That's not good for me. I'm so sorry. There's a lot of panic in there.

Spies, evil comets, and you prefer my comet.

[Kamon (Heart)]
My comet's the best.

[(Nessie)]
Your comet is beautiful and wonderful.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That it is. It's terrifyingly beautiful. Like, emphasis on the terrify.

[Referee (James)]
Terrify? I don't know about that. I mean, it's on a nice mountain.

Drive throughs, there's people around. People can use it for magic.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I must have been mistaken then.

[Referee (James)]
Research schools, studying stories. Absolutely delightful.

[Mech]
Wondrous. Terrific.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, a comet is used for crafting and making things. That's nice.

[Referee (James)]
But anyway, so what should we get into the Aquine Academy here?

[(Nessie)]
Oh, we're going for the gold bag. We're going to give them goodies.

[Referee (James)]
All right, all right. It looks like Nick must have ridden past something nice along the edges. Cameron, make me an insight check.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okey dokey. Da-da-da-da-da. That is not very good.

[Referee (James)]
No, there's something off about what he said earlier.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, see, again, another one of those spots on his person. And now his veins have a little bit more of like a consistent awmy color to them. Okay, we go down further to the jungled portion of Cimay.

This little inlet. I don't really actually don't know what it's called. I guess technically it's a massive bay or like an ocean.

But he takes you guys to another elf cairn. This one is distributed way across the trees. And there's a few massive, massive, massive trees that have been grown in the same place.

To support a, to support very large like pillars. And then a second tree has been grown on top of each of these pillars. Almost like Taramin, almost like Taramin earlier.

There's a network, but technically smaller, of highways and roads. These are like rope bridges and places that people can swing across. Yeah, these, uh, these...

The Wodels who live here are a little bit more highway on average. But I don't think that they'll have an issue with us dropping them.

[(Nessie)]
Snowballs, then.

[Referee (James)]
Say again?

[(Nessie)]
Snowballs, then.

[Referee (James)]
Snowballs. Oh, I do love pranks. I wasn't aware that's what the blue bag carried.

[(Nessie)]
Oh yeah, it's all snowballs.

[Referee (James)]
There's usually something funny.

[(Nessie)]
You're very...

[Referee (James)]
The third bag is that we came across, it's usually something.

[Mech]
Effective for spreading good cheer. Snowballs. Let's go with that, yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, we're doing... Sorry, you go. We're at the Wodels?

What is the place called?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, is it this little tiny thing all the way at the bottom?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, no, no, no. I'm creating it now.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, okay. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
In the actual show. I need water. All right, after this, I'm getting up and I'm getting...

Yep.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I couldn't have a low break. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
That'll take like... We'll take like 10 minutes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Sounds good.

[(Nessie)]
Then I can get something to eat.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, the Twear Tree, Karen.

[(Nessie)]
We're not gonna go to Marlin, are we?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, it's fine.

[Speaker 7]
Why don't you?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
They have no idea that it was us and also, I saved them.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You did. I wasn't here for this, so I've just turned and be like, oh, what happened to Marlin? It's fine, no, it's all good.

[(Nessie)]
I'm sure they're fine. I like to think that they saw like the iceberg drop in a huge wave. And then all of a sudden, it just wasn't a wave anymore.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It did that thing that happens in the ocean where it's like, oh, God, that's a huge wave. And then by the time it gets to you, it's just like... Yeah.

[Mech]
There we go. I realize now that I should have just been using Divination on the blue bag to find out, okay, like, how bad is this? I should have been doing that.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, you can do it now.

[(Nessie)]
You can do it now.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, you can do it after the chance of failure afterwards, so.

[Mech]
25% chance. I roll the dice.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Cumulative, so if you cast it more than once...

[Mech]
Yep.

[Referee (James)]
Is it more than one? Uh, what is it? Is it...

If you cast a spell two or more... Yeah, two or more. Okay.

[Mech]
Yeah, so like the second time it would be...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, at two, it's 25%. At three, I believe...

[Mech]
50.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It becomes 50. Yeah, so like the more you use it, the more likely it is that it's random reading.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You could leave it off then for more important ones, because the last time it said it was a wheel, so it's not... They are manageable, so...

[(Nessie)]
And we also have people who are researching the snowballs, so...

[Kamon (Heart)]
We can put them in the box again.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so what are you guys dropping here?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think hot chocolate sounds like a good idea, personally.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, no green? Yeah. I figured since...

Or no blue. Since they're... They like to fight.

[Mech]
I mean, if they like fighting...

[Kamon (Heart)]
I mean, yeah. Okay. That's what we're getting.

Yeah.

[Mech]
Cool.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, so we give them... We'll give them a box of it saying, please fight, please. Merry Christmas.

Happy holidays. Enjoy a fight.

[Mech]
Merry Christmas. Happy Christmas.

[(Nessie)]
No, it's Merry Christmas. We've already had this discussion.

[Referee (James)]
It's definitely, as the local lord of Christmasy, right?

[Mech]
Ah, Merry Christmas. Very specifically.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, we'll give them a blue bag. And they're isolated.

[Referee (James)]
No one will notice.

[(Nessie)]
No.

[Referee (James)]
You're nervous?

[(Nessie)]
If it ends up being like a xenomorph thing, it'll be fine.

[Referee (James)]
All right. Yeah, it's right about this time that an animal messenger makes it back. A small piece of paper.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, hello. Oh, I guess Mimosa will take it.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. It is a... Who is the...

[Mech]
Well, there's...

[(Nessie)]
Oh, yeah. I'll go to the druid then. Or the...

Yeah, go for it.

[Mech]
Druid. I'll pick them. There is just one word.

[Referee (James)]
There's just one word on this.

[Mech]
And I will type it out here.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, did you get back to us already?

[Mech]
I don't know if that's cause for... I don't know if that's like good or cause for concern.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. All right, you guys now make it to that little island chain down at the bottom of here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I don't know what this means. We should stop giving these to people. That's what it means.

Yeah. I don't know. That's enough blue bags.

We can tell him stories instead. Yeah. He got...

He got his benefit. Figuroths are very bad.

[Referee (James)]
He gets a little bit... And as earlier, the gem grows back ever so slightly. Kind of even where it started at.

[Mech]
Three blue, four gold, three green. Neat. I have no idea what the hell that word means.

I only...

[(Nessie)]
Mimosa.

[Mech]
Nobody's going to tell you either.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, Mimosa would know. I just... Nessie has to like remember.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It... I had a note on what exactly it was earlier. But I do remember it being very bad.

Oh, right. It's this giant creature.

[Speaker 6]
Take a break.

[Kamon (Heart)]
With like... Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you tell him when you get back. Um... I actually don't care.

I have... I have had those stories before.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay. Oh, yeah. That was the thing that Mimosa had to fight for the spider.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yes, the tall leg evil creature thing. You would know what it is though. My character wouldn't.

So I... Yeah, Mimosa. Oh, jeez.

But fundamentally, it's like this giant centipede-like thing. But it also has legs. I can't really describe.

Um... So, you know a worm? But with teeth.

And multiple heads. And also spider legs.

[Mech]
Tremors?



[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh my god. That's what the... That's what the legs were.

They were from the Shigaroth. That's why it had so many teeth and eyes. There's...

There's one living in that comet. These are eggs, man. Oh.

All right. Well, that's fun.

[Mech]
Oh. Oh, that's great.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So yeah, Shigaroth have these really long spindly legs. And they're sort of just multiple-headed worm-like teeth things. And it's not fun to fight them, I will say.

But the fact that we are perhaps spreading more of them is concerning. So maybe we should stop doing that. To be fair, two of them were contained.

All of them are contained. We contained all of them. We gave these- He didn't personally say he contained the one with the wood elves.

[(Nessie)]
But two out of three of the ones were in containers.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, I thought... Oh, I'd mentioned that we put them in the box. Wasn't that what the note was attached to?

The box? Being like, here's a fight. Sure.

Yeah. So it's all good. We just need to stop now.

All right. Yeah. Hmm.

So there's a very high likelihood that these are some sort of weird comet eggs things. Which is fun. That's fantastic.

Honestly, that's what was in the comment, and now I don't remember.

[Mech]
Spreading invasive species.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yay!

[Mech]
No, no.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Remember- Okay. In the comment, remember when you looked into it, he described it as crustacean-like legs come out. And when you see further, it's just a bunch of teeth and eyes.

Which is on par for a sugaroth. I don't remember them having eyes. That's what's throwing me off.

[(Nessie)]
Huge, huge lore on Zephain.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I just have to find it and collect it. She's invested in Zephain.

[(Nessie)]
No worries.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No worries. I made notes on what was seen. So again, the only thing that's throwing me off is the eyes.

Because when- Well, it was undead. The undead sugaroth we fought last time. So maybe that's why it didn't have eyes.

But yeah. So this does actually match the description of a sugaroth. Especially considering its size and everything.

Alrighty. Yeah. Okay.

So enough sugaroth eggs. That's probably why it was right next to that. It does beg the question, why does it give Zephain the energy?

Probably because it's living in his comet. That may be it. Yeah, he's definitely attached to the comet.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I remember Mimosa hearing that he found the spider to be his friend. But that seems to have changed because now he's not acknowledging its existence.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, yeah, so- Let me make a note of that.

[(Nessie)]
That's why I don't remember if it was actually... What is it called? A sugaroth.

Um, but I assume it is. But like the comet fell and Zephain made a friend. And it seemed like Zephain actually pined for them.

But then they left him and he's been sad ever since. Which is why Mimosa wanted to be his friend. Because that was really sad.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. So he made a friend who- Was it the spider in this case? Yes.

Are they considered beasts? Okay. Made a friend.

Spider thing. The friend left. Friend left.

Pining. That's how Mimosa became friends. However, there's a chance the spider friend is what's in the comet.

However, again, he's not acknowledging it.

[(Nessie)]
Under a spell. She has a knack for befriending people under a spell.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And gosh, like, that kind of seems like it's a Mimosa thing if her, you know, if she is now the the snake or whatever.

[(Nessie)]
Oh shit!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And that's the spider.

[(Nessie)]
Oh my god, right!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Gotta save your boyfriend.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. Were you locked in like anti-spider war? So there you go, it fits.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, like the first one, her grandma and great grandma- No! Her great grandmother and her great aunt fought or died fighting because of spirits that are always warring against each other. Snake and spider.

And the snakes were born into her relatives and passed it down to her.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Shame it's not grand-aunt and great-grand-aunt. It'd make things so much less confusing. Well, part of that's because halflings have a long life.

Yeah. No, I was just talking about the etymology of- Oh. No, no, no.

[Referee (James)]
You do have the journal with you.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I need to put that in my inventory. I don't know why it's not in there.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You had it in there. I saw it the other day.

[(Nessie)]
Are you sure it's not the Fae? No, I remember seeing it was your aunt.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, was it in your notes? I don't know. I don't have access to your sheet right now, so.

I don't think it's in there. I'm gonna put it in there just in case, though. Did you put it into your bag of holding that you now have access?

[(Nessie)]
Uh, I don't know. It's not in there. I don't think- I think it's something I forgot to do because I got pulled away.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I could've sworn I saw it in there somewhere.

[(Nessie)]
The children, no.

[Speaker 6]
Is it great-grandmother or grandmother? I think it was just your grandmother. Okay.



[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, it was from your grandmother.

[Speaker 6]
It was just regular grandmother. Thank you.

No worries. Okay, now it will be in there. Maybe.

Now it's in there. My kid's woke up, but I'm trying to convince him not to. It's not working, obviously, but damn.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's nothing fun going on. You don't need to be awake right now. Exactly.

[Mech]
In the worst case scenario, I can always charm monster.

[(Nessie)]
What?

[Mech]
I have charm monster as a druid. I have it prepared because I've noticed people going around with giant snakes, just, like, taming them. So I was like, okay.

[Speaker 6]
What happened?

[(Nessie)]
Just like- Mimosa didn't tame the snake that she rode. She just rode it and plucked a planet from its mouth.

[Mech]
No, I'm also referring to the one that had magic items fused into it that's now in a dungeon. Okay, she's like, all right. That's a Narcissus, probably utterly pissed right now, but all right.

[(Nessie)]
Where does one find a damn book in the icons?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, um, oh, thank God. I was pouring something in for a second there. I thought I was going to miss it.

It is under commodities, I believe. Of course it is. No, I lied to you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I am going to dip to the bathroom, so just tell me if I miss anything. Okey dokey.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
It's under sundries, and it's the first option, books. Books, yes. There's a book with a handy spider on it.

Actually, that probably wouldn't fit for her, huh? Because she's snake. Sneaky, yeah.

There's one with an eye.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, there's one with a reptilian eye. Um, yeah, that looks like it's going to be- I liked that exclamation point. Oh, the quest log?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, that looks like that. Oh, that one? A good solution for the quest log.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
There's a couple modules for it, um, but I'm not a big fan of it, because it's like, there's a lot of steps to make a quest log in it. And I guess there's a simple one, but the guy who makes it, it's a paid mod, so I have not picked it up.

[Referee (James)]
I know that there are some Discord 2- there are some Foundry 2 Discord mods, um, and I was considering if I had, like, a channel that would go straight to- if I had a channel, I could select which messages actually went to the Discord, and which channel it is.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And I would be able to- Um, I am going to be playing with that tonight, in my personal game, to see how it works. Um, I could give you a report back on its features.

[Mech]
Please do. Please do.

[Referee (James)]
Because I'm going to have to put it back in a- that's the main problem when it comes to information and such. I literally had to learn latex codings. I'm having to teach me latex codings, because I'm so done with trying to, like, collect bits and pieces of information from all over, in a billion different notes, in a billion different places.

It's so frustrating. Yeah, from what I remember- I'm not working with any freelancers who don't know how to use GitHub anymore.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
From what I remember, it does specifically do everything, but I was going to try and see if I could get it to not do the roles, because no one gives a shit about the roles. Most modules have settings, so. I know Heart went to the bathroom, so.

[Referee (James)]
That's fine.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, if anybody has any questions- That stupid green arrow, that my ADHD is wanting me to click. No, I think they were just talking about the Shiva Grah, and how it relates to Mimosa, specifically.

[Speaker 6]
I mean, we fought one once. Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
We did pretty good against it. We survived. None of us, I don't think, went down.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And that's all that's important.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah. We're here to remember the tale. I don't think any of us went down that one.

I think it got close, but I don't think we actually went down.

[Mech]
Why do I feel like it's a very good thing that, like, that Rowan is going to be seeking ways into getting to space?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Especially since your resurrection racket has a wrench in the plan, and that wrench is me! Now Pekka is the bad guy.

[Mech]
No, he's not mentioning, like, in-character the whole thing. That's an incarnation thing, to be honest, but...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, but Pekka's a level 17 cleric.

[Mech]
Ah. Work together?

[(Nessie)]
All right, all right, all right.

[Mech]
One provides new bodies, you know, if you're sick of your current one, the other, like, oh, like, there you go.

[Speaker 7]
Hello, I'm back.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We don't even need bodies. And also, you'll probably get- Hello, back. You'll probably get along with the Necromancer.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's not quite the same stuff, though.

[Mech]
Rowan is a sports hero. He went to the, like, I'm pretty sure it got, like, agreed on, like, like, the, the, that one necromancy college, whatever, I think.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No, no, no, specifically, though, my, uh, one of, um, one of my characters, because they're looking for general immortality rather than undead immortality, it's just unfortunate the best way to do it is undead at the moment.

[Mech]
Bobo, clone.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It doesn't work, to be honest.

[Mech]
I mentioned clone is probably the end game, but...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, so true, yes. However, it's more of a, uh, want-it-for-everyone, not-just-self type thing. It's like, you will not die whether you like it or not.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right, um...

[Mech]
Just to expand on the whole thing, my idea is find a College of Creation bard who's managed to get to around level 14, work with them, and undercut everybody else's prices for resurrection. Slash reincarnation. Sell each time for, like, 300 GP, split the profits, you know?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, the problem with things like resurrection is you do have a minimum maximum cost.

[Mech]
Not if you reach level 14.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Sounds like an MLM to me.

[Mech]
At level 14, the price limit goes away. You can, in theory, have a, like a, at that point...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
What makes the price limit go away?

[Mech]
Their level 14 feature for their, uh, thing. For a subclass.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm just gonna... I'll quote it. I'll, uh, put it out of context.

I don't know. This thing, um... Yeah, here it is.

[Mech]
No longer limited by GP value.

[Speaker 6]
There you go. Hm. Make the world's most wonderful diamond.

[Mech]
Yep, and eventually, at high enough levels, I can get true resurrection.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Nice.

[Mech]
That's a whole bunch of favors that could be gathered there.

[Speaker 6]
I would have to...

[Mech]
I would have to seek out a bard who's going to work with me on that.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, that's so funny, because I do have a Bard of Creation. I just don't use her anymore. It could be...

It can be a background deal. She doesn't really have to do anything, but just be like, yes. Well, she's not leveling up anymore, because I don't use her.

[Speaker 7]
Ah!

[Perra (Otterstar)]
She was only eight. I used her for one session and decided I didn't think she fit this campaign.

[Mech]
So if I want to go for this, I'd probably have to work on myself, like, slowly level up Bard throughout the sessions.

[Referee (James)]
All righty, so let's jump back into it. Were there any questions following from the previous set of questions?

[Speaker 6]
Not at the moment.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Would it be possible to tell what type... if it's, like, a specific type of Sugaroth by looking at them? Are there different types?

Well, there's that one and dead one. I just want to know if it's, like, extra evil or something.

[Referee (James)]
Go ahead and roll a...

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm not smart enough for that. All right, I'll try.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Has it been an hour since we started the Balan?

[Referee (James)]
It's probably going by really quickly. So I think everybody's... Yeah, I think everybody's, like, check thing for Intelligence.

Yeah, I think everybody's Enhance Ability should still be active.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right. So you still do have advantage.

[Referee (James)]
All right.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, perfect.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you kindly. You're welcome. The second one was a one.

This is probably an egg.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I was right about the eggs. Do I know if there are any, like, specific... Like, how do I put it?

Does it diverge from a normal Shigaroth in any sort of way? For example, being, like, more, I don't know, like, ice-based, as they're putting it.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know what you mean by that question.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. So there was the undead Shigaroth that had its whole debacle. Is this one, like, an ice one?

Does it have... Would it look like it was, I don't know, resistant? Okay.

Oh, English. Okay. Yes, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, no, it's just, there's just, there's Shigaroth, right? When you guys fought one, it was swathed in bandages and next to a mummy's puretheduct there.

[(Nessie)]
So it probably does... I can't think of the words, never mind. It's abominable.

Adapt? Is that the words I wanted? Adapt to its environment.

[Mech]
Okay, I'll just change the...

[Referee (James)]
We think they might be edged. You can now create notes inside the server and I believe they can be, like, searched for.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh? Um, where? Is it the journal entry thing?

Oh, the forms?

[Referee (James)]
I just put one in camping.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, thank you.

[Referee (James)]
This is gonna be great for us.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We could have such a delicious crab boil with this thing.

[Referee (James)]
Oh no, I need to make cooking, uh, I gotta add a cooking tab to the encounter manual.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Ah yes, delicious in dungeon indeed. Kingmaker also has one. It's great.

[Referee (James)]
Yes, yes. So to describe it, these things are quite literally... They are 50 feet tall.

They have eight crustacean-like legs. Um, it has a... Its center just looks like a rock.

Almost like a daddy long leg, almost, in how it's just that center piece, right? There's separation between, like, thorax, abdomen, and head, I guess? It's head, thorax, abdomen?

Can't remember. It's that center, but that center is just covered in mouths. And then all of those mouths can stretch out and strike at me.

I made this Harley note because, specifically, it was a guard. Go ahead.

[(Nessie)]
Um, the little video of all the geckos eating sugar and it's like, Meow, meow, meow, meow.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
That's what I pictured.

[Referee (James)]
Who does? Okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, that's not a pleasant experience. All right, I need to turn this off. Okay.

[Referee (James)]
Okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, this is my favorite video.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
So, um...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh. Mimosa, so, upon rereading the Shigarath form thing, I believe your friend may be in little danger of losing his mind.

[(Nessie)]
She just smiles and, like, does a slight nod. Like, yeah, she fucking knows.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[(Nessie)]
Okay. But she doesn't want Zephain to catch on her scene.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, no worries. Just, like, gives you a thumbs up. Like, hi.

[Referee (James)]
What's the problem when it comes to you? That is the problem. Proximity is simply too insane.

Okay, so down here is Shiro Village, Zephain. It goes back and forth. He circles the village a couple times.

This one has a curse on it from Prismarine. Technically, it's, you know... Gifts from our folk can be...

Frankly, I think it was delightful what she did for them. Nobody can get off the island, but they don't have any real want for supplies or anything. Ships and wrecks, and then shipwrecks, will just kind of get drawn to the island itself.

Nobody has a soft landing.

[Mech]
Okay, where is this?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Very, very bottom of the map.

[Mech]
Ah, thank you.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Well, um, I guess we can throw them... ...from the gold. Our gold?

Okay. Because they don't have any want for resources.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, but...

[Referee (James)]
I know that that town square there has a... There's a well in it that you can use to get to it. A place called Rosemary Lake.

I can never get Prismarine in, only if I have instant teleporting. She kept it so well hidden that I was never able to...

[(Nessie)]
Oh.

[Referee (James)]
It's probably somewhere in here. Playing the sidequests. Let's go.

Oh, that's what the Fae can do to each other. All right, you guys get that. We're giving them gold?

I'm giving them trinkets.

[(Nessie)]
What is this place called?

[Referee (James)]
Sea Row Village. Sea Row, okay.

[Mech]
So, so far we have three blue, three green, and five gold dropped. No? Okay.

That is correct. Hmm, next, next one should probably be green.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's what I was thinking.

[Mech]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Because I'm pretty sure the next one is probably Morellon.

[Mech]
Yeah, the next one could be Morellon.

[Referee (James)]
I only did a good job. What is your, uh, what's your goal here?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
At Morellon?

[(Nessie)]
Make sure that they don't recognize us. Oh.

[Speaker 7]
Hey.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. You guys are welcome.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We can be like... Sorry, guys. Sorry.

Oh, no, I was just mentioning how, um, if it's, like, even just slightly wrecked, since we're giving the green, you can put a little note being like, you're welcome! All's good now.

[(Nessie)]
No, no, no, we're not bringing it up.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Don't worry about that.

[(Nessie)]
No, we're not bringing it up. Okay, okay. I don't want to taint the nice gift that they're giving, getting.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
They could certainly use some cheer.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Green down the... I guess now he's, he's back, he's right back where he started as far as absent-minded. Let's just say about Morellon or the accompanying towns.

Okay, uh, next up is the Hysylian Garen.

[Mech]
So, can we drop the green? Sounds like you guys dropped the green. Yeah, we dropped it.

All right. Do you want to keep track of all that? I just feel like it's going to be very important.

[Kamon (Heart)]
No worries. Um, we can cross-check in case either of us have missed anything.

[(Nessie)]
I'm also taking a good while.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yay! It's not a scientific study, it's three people.

[Referee (James)]
All right, the Hysylian Garen. He's like, I, I think... The Lyle was ever here, in Funtime.

Very frustrating to me. Like, I always end up in Spain eating an elch, but I do have these lovely pictures now.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Uh, um, this isn't something a character would know, but by Funtime, does it happen to look like the prisoners and stuff that were captured that one time?

[Referee (James)]
Uh, this won't look like the prisoners.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, I'm... Would anyone, would any of the prisoners that had been captured and subsequently left be in this village? From the Titanic.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. From the Titanic, yeah. Remember, the Hysylian Garen was allied with the Common Elch Garen, so it's...

It's the only Garen, it's the only Garen you know.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, what color do we want to go for here?

[Referee (James)]
And that was O'Lyle earlier, not So'Lyle. Uh, the, the Titanic lady. The one that you guys killed.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, yeah, that one I know.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Don't know. The description's just, O'Lyle's place had a fun time there, operated by high elves, so they probably don't care for anything.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, I was gonna say gold, maybe? It could be a dick to them and give them blue. We could.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, but how many of those blues do we want out there? I know, that's why it was a joke.

[(Nessie)]
I mean, okay, so then gold or green? I feel like they'd prefer gold over... They'd find gold more useful than green.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, let's go gold.

[Mech]
Just give these people magic arms?

[Kamon (Heart)]
All right, are we sure? The people relied with... O'Lyle's dead.

That doesn't mean much.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, fine, give him green. Whatever.

[Mech]
Green it is, then.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, that's the safest option. We could just get them in.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Blue is their bad option. It is objectively a bad option, but blue exists.

[Mech]
Something tells me they're bouncing out. You could probably handle a blue. Probably could.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, he's already marked it as green, so...

[Referee (James)]
Okay. I haven't marked it yet.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, Macaroni did.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. So, hands for blue, hands for green. Yeah, just put it to a vote.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm marking it myself as well. Well... I don't particularly care for these guys.

[Mech]
So, blue.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I mean, Nessie, I think you're the... Yeah, you're the deciding factor here.

[(Nessie)]
They were allied with O'Lyle, so they were cool with what she was doing. They were actively helping her. Okay, give him blue.

Whatever.

[Mech]
All right. Blue it is.

[Kamon (Heart)]
We should give a little warning note, though, so they can kill each other off, but we won't have to deal with it.

[(Nessie)]
In a container with a note that says, Merry Christmas, and then some, like, Enjoy, or...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Please kill us again. You might want to deal with us, at least. Kill as soon as possible.

[Referee (James)]
Always in a container, because who doesn't...

[(Nessie)]
Exactly! And we don't want the snowballs to just disintegrate immediately. Wait, that means...

No, this is what she's saying to him?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, there's a snowball!

[Referee (James)]
You see, um, well, first of all, dispersing of one of the snowballs, you see him sit up for a second, he's like, I forgot about O'Lyle. He just reaches into the blue bag and just throws a snowball into the iceberg.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, damn it! We are never gonna cancel out that area!

[Kamon (Heart)]
Wait, wait!

[Speaker 7]
Job security!

[Kamon (Heart)]
To deal with some snow sugar off later! Dang it!

[(Nessie)]
That girl's just like, oh, okay. I mean, she's dead, but that's okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
That's super sweet, it's her memory.

[Referee (James)]
When she chooses a new host, it's gonna be a tremendous brag. Okay. Now this is the most animated and clear and coherent you've seen him so far.

All right.

[(Nessie)]
Really does not like O'Lyle.

[Referee (James)]
But no, I love O'Lyle. She used to be a big champion. She's not the champion anymore, but, you know.

[(Nessie)]
He picks a new host, so like, she reincarnates?

[Referee (James)]
I'm actually really not sure how exactly it works, but I believe that she chooses people to champion for her. She's the champion of Hyborial Court, so she chooses somebody else that's still active. That's why we call her the once champion of the Hyborial Court, instead of having given her another title.

So her head will be a symbol of her domination and authority, as opposed to her sword.

[(Nessie)]
Okay.

[Referee (James)]
I suppose technically there's always two O'Lyles.

[(Nessie)]
Well, I think Mosa would side-eye Para, like, fucking hell. We need to watch Rana.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Maya, you mean? It's not Rana who got it.

[(Nessie)]
It's Maya, right? If somebody got reincarnated, it's always Maya. It's the same consonants.

Confusing. Maya. We're watching out for Maya.

Don't do that.

[Mech]
Rowan is just, like, internally thinking, okay, so how would Grilled Shivagoroth taste?

[(Nessie)]
Would you like one to take home with you?

[Mech]
Nah. He'll go hunt for that himself later.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, here we go. Next up is a fortification. We're going to keep sitting here between a mountain pass alongside a 96-mile-long...

It's... no, it's longer than... No, technically, technically not.

It just kind of stretches a little bit into the other hexes and, you know, there's some other adverse effects. This is the only barren place that you've seen in the entire valley. The places that are a little bit more sickly or composed of biomes that normally don't support as dense vegetation have been insinuated or just neatly down to earth and beautiful.

So this 96-mile-long scar along the mountain, on the side of the mountains here, intersecting with this mountain pass, sticks out to you. The only place where you'd see a dead tree still stands. And there is a...

Keep. There we go. Right in between the mountain pass there.

This thing turns back to everyone and says, I... I'm perfectly fine with skipping this one, by the way. You see a large number of dwarven war machines on the side.

A large number of dwarven war machines basically behind this keep.

[(Nessie)]
Okay, what exactly is that?

[Referee (James)]
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

[(Nessie)]
Well, she's just gonna ask about it. Like, what's that place? Why is it barren?

[Referee (James)]
About five centuries ago, half a millennia, whatever you want to say. 500 years ago, there was a... King Kragma I sicked his armies on Sinead in the aftermath of...

As you know, this land was once floating, powered by the civilization of Perseus. He didn't really like them all that much. They didn't like us all that much.

But we still found ways to interact and to... and to bring some good cheer. Supplicants and Christmas offerings.

But King Kragma, once the blessing of the sun fell upon this valley, King Kragma for the first time decided to resolve some grudges from the previous dynasty as the people of this land invaded. And this is where we stopped them. That is the smoke stone we're down there.

At that point, the Summer Fae were quite well-established here. I still had some remnants of power left. And it was one of our only, in the past thousand years, it was one of our only interventions by the Hyboreal.

It was...

[Speaker 7]
Give me coal.

[Referee (James)]
...terrible. The coal is usually in the blue bag. So, do we go blue here, then? We'll be able to let them work on one of the things.

[Speaker 7]
Actually, wait, no.

[Referee (James)]
Nick also probably has some coal. We could throw something from the blue bag. Because I don't mind pranking them.

That's a good way of spreading the good cheer. They did not accept the Christmas truce.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, I'm fine with the bag. All right.

[Referee (James)]
Blue time, yeah? I was definitely not happy with it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I do like how that, despite knowing the thing, we're just like, yeah, I mean... It's more things to fight. It's more XP down the line.

[(Nessie)]
We have to balance these out, I'm guessing. I know, I know.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I just find it a little funny.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
That's all. I'm also, I went back and was thinking about the previous ballad we did, where, I don't know if you were there, Hart, but we kept avoiding war, and it ended up not exactly having the desired effect, I think. So it's like, I mean, who knows?

Maybe throwing these things out will weaken the one that's in the meteor. We don't know. It's worth a shot.

[Referee (James)]
That's why I balanced them out, or went in your favor. As far as, when it came to Camtasia's ballad, she has less resources to just kind of start slaughtering people across the Underdark.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So you mean Camtasia's ballad? I was not there for that one, I didn't.

[Mech]
I listened in.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I listened in, but I didn't have a level 12 character, so did not play. It was entertaining.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We ended up knocking a lot of people into comas.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, we did. I wasn't there for the whole thing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I wasn't there for the whole thing. So you can imagine my surprise when I wake up and it's like, oh, by the way, Rosemaryna's unconscious, so you're free to go. And I'm like, oh, all right.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, we did a lot of good news, bad news, those rounds.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, that's why I'm not as worried about the consequences so much here.

[Mech]
There's a small part of me that really wants to get like six of each dropped, mostly because of certain things about my character.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Again, just one is fine. It will help Mimosa's buddy.

[Referee (James)]
And help indeed. Significantly larger. And now you can see a little bit more green behind her.

It's kind of like pale. Almost, and this is odd for a day, but almost cataract-like. Bless you.

[(Nessie)]
Sorry, I'm not even in the same room as her, but I'm trying to get lunch, so.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, so you guys.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Smoke's doing a readout. Hi.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my gosh.

[Kamon (Heart)]
It's okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Tell me. Totoro.

[(Nessie)]
I, at first, didn't have an actual map, so that's why.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so, looking to travel far back up. I think our next. It's at this point that Sol Brasier joins you folks in flight.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, hey, how's it going?

[Referee (James)]
I could smell you from some distance.

[(Nessie)]
Yep, we're.

[Referee (James)]
But the pastry's reaching its richest far, with everything in your arms, and I'm glad to see that you look well.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. Do you spell his name?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, Sol Gregory? No! Sol Gregory.

[(Nessie)]
I will murder you. That's not how you spell his name.

[Referee (James)]
I have a few new scents with you. Smells awfully, awfully cold.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, we're traveling with Zephane. We're doing his ballad. Spreading Christmas cheer.

Spreading Christmas cheer.

[Mech]
Christmas cheer. The cold is part of a prank.

[Referee (James)]
You might have a spider issue in the near future. I'm going to ignore that. I'm going to on Mimosa's behalf.

But I would certainly never, myself, describe senseless murder of civilians. Changing of an entire ecology is a simple prank.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, yeah, that does sound bad.

[Mech]
Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
We'll absolutely have tea once I'm done, and we can talk about it. Would you like some pastries in the meantime?

[Referee (James)]
I, you know what, I would. The face is telling me this.

[(Nessie)]
We have lots to catch up on about.

[Referee (James)]
Sol Gregory, uh, sniffs a few more times. Oh, I smell a Comet of the North on you. I don't know if you recall, but the whole reason I met your great-grandmother to begin with.

[(Nessie)]
Yes. Yes, that's one of the things I wanted. To talk with you about.

[Referee (James)]
My old home went, you, Sophane, smell like the Comet of the North. I'm not so sure about that. I mean, I do have, I do have a Comet.

It is in the North, but I don't know which Comet you're referring to. Sol Gregory says, yes, yes, come to think of it. I mean, you'd smell a little bit like it, or I smell something like it.

But you smell, I suppose, like it. Everybody's sent for Comets nowadays, I'm sure. Which I thank you as.

Anyways, don't hurt Mimosa. I'll brainfire a pal and you and your dynasty if anything should happen to you. I'm sure we are all at a perfectly fine understanding.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Subtle talk.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Girls fight.

[(Nessie)]
I think she's just, like, patting him, like, it's okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
What type of, uh, what type of species is Sol Gregory? I, I'm not sure.

[(Nessie)]
He's a dragon.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Thank you.

[Mech]
Oh, yeah, I had literally no mental image of this place.

[Kamon (Heart)]
You said fly by and it could have been anything. And I was just like, uh, hmm.

[Referee (James)]
So, Sol Gregory is a sun dragon, golden in color. There is a great deal of scarring across the, across his eyes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, that explains why he was mostly smelling and couldn't tell.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, and she's, she's patting. And she's trying to, like, with her voice and tone, be like, I know this situation is fishy. I will talk with you about it.

Like, it's okay.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, that, that explains, explains a lot of what he said. All right, um, I still don't know how to, to spell the last bit of his name. Sol Venere?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, G- I put it in the, uh, voiceover flow.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you. Also, just put that in the chat, uh, just like that. Um, okay, yeah.

What are you guys going to drop at the Banyan King?

[(Nessie)]
Um, good.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Um, do you want to do, like, good gold? Or good, like, hot chocolate?

[Mech]
Hmm, gold or green? Probably go green, honestly.

[(Nessie)]
I'm sticking green, yeah. All right.

[Kamon (Heart)]
What? Ah, wait, no. Chat, right.

All right, so I'm going to go ahead.

[Referee (James)]
And he's, let's see here. Zathane's crown diminishes it just slightly. Okay, so for, uh, now technically speaking, the person who's in charge, or, I won't say in charge, uh, the person, I generally consider Ciara, like, the patron of Wolfclaw Keep.

I'm sorry, I generally consider Ciara, like, the patron of Bronloch. It's, it's Baroness Ciara. She's the only one, she's the most powerful noble there, in terms of her might, and I suppose decision-making power at the moment.

So, it is next on our list.

[(Nessie)]
Um, loot, yeah. I think, I think Ciara would appreciate it if we gave her some treasure.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I'm sure everyone there would, too.

[Referee (James)]
No? You'd take her back, we're told.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah. I think everyone there would appreciate some treasure.

[(Nessie)]
Either way, Ciara and Landy would prefer.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't know, I think Landy would get a kick out of the egg, but, you know. That is an option.

[Speaker 6]
No, we could. Um, no, we're gonna go.

[Referee (James)]
So, basically what's gonna happen, uh, Phineas, this is my, this is my way of getting things back in. Um, that, that giant list of, like, unused items and stuff like that, so that people in the campaign could start making use of them.

[Mech]
Yeah, okay.

[Referee (James)]
So, we've dropped another gold. There's one of my methods here.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You're reseeding them?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah. Which I normally do via theft, right? You look down and it's gone.

This time, I guess I could distribute it to some of the players.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, is one of them a gun? And does it drop, does it fall in monks' hands? What?

[Mech]
Maybe I'll just, like, look at you. Yes, I know which one you're talking about. Maybe I'll just look at her.

Is that Zealot's Reward? At, uh, my search for her.

[(Nessie)]
I think so, yeah. I just know that one of Monk's guns was stolen.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, I think it was Zealot's Reward. Now it's back. It's like someone's dreaming it's back as well.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, we lost one of those?

[Referee (James)]
Yes.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Well, we'll get to look at it in the Unclaimed.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, was it the Dream of Dreaming?

[Referee (James)]
It was indeed.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, Nessie and I were trying to figure out what the heck that was. Yeah. I couldn't find anything in any of the chats.

[Referee (James)]
I was going through them, trying to pick- Actually, I think the Dream of Dreaming is the Dreaming Vessel. The Rod of Dreaming is the one that- We used it occasionally, but, like, it's a hard one to make consistent. I think.

Nobody used the Rod of Dreaming. Oh, the Rod of Dreaming, yeah. Yeah.

Now, the Vessel you guys have been buying looks pretty clever.

[Mech]
I need, uh, I need that Arcane Grimoire plus two. That thing's pretty sick.

[(Nessie)]
And also this Dagger Otterbolt Mummy have.

[Mech]
I just quietly stare at the mobile.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, she won't let me have the evil one.

[Referee (James)]
There are a- Let me snap those out. Nobody has ever used those, which makes me so upset. Every time I hand out a wand, nobody uses it.

[(Nessie)]
I'll make a wizard just for you. We're gonna use all the wands.

[Referee (James)]
Well, we barely had- Here's the thing. We had no wizards for the first six months of the campaign, at least. None.

[(Nessie)]
I even have a character that I found that I wanted to use.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I vaguely remember you trying to get me to use a Hoth wand, and I remember being like, but I don't think I need it. But what would I use it for?

[Mech]
Now it's available for somebody else. Quietly stares at my recently created wizard with god-awful stats. That's right, there's two people.

Okay, so Kwan, Ciru.

[Referee (James)]
All right, so he's down to sevens. The Fane is down to seven of the spots remaining. Awesome.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
This is a really nice way to tour the whole map and like actually really get a good look at everything.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, it is!

[Kamon (Heart)]
Thank you. We're getting a whole lot of lore on the places too, and it's great. Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
The Fane looks down at what we'll call Keep and Brownlock. Well, he looks at a few different things. He's looking at the White Ark.

He's like, that's a Jewel of the Underdark subject. It was a rather famous battle. Not many people remember it except for probably Ken Fink.

I only heard it from her in passing secondhand. In an altered mental state, no less, but the White Ark was pursued by quite a few Black Arks. Basically, similar in color, similar in size, similar in construction and size.

They're just black instead of being powered. I can't remember what she said the White Ark was powered by, but I know that the Black Arks were powered by strong aberrations and strong demons.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh, is that that big ship in the Brownlock?

[Referee (James)]
Yep, it's the one that somebody's just using as a means. Next question. For those of you who have not seen it before...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
This is the one I was talking about earlier.

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, it's the fantasy equivalent of a cruise ship sitting off the coast of Brownlock.

[Mech]
Interesting. Oh yeah, my sorcerer character got some news about uh... about some of the Blizzard, didn't he?

Interesting. Black Dogs, reminds me.

[Referee (James)]
It's a shame that we weren't able to give anything to... ...the Wood Isle. Except that that's where one of them is.

I believe the Black Arks were also... Oh, Colleen! That was a...

I haven't seen her in so long. Somebody told me that she got killed by the Black Arks. Maybe it wasn't.

No, I think it was just a captain. I don't recall who else. If anybody...

But... Hey, Mosa. For anybody here, but Mosa is the one I trust the most.

If you happen to find out any... ...what happened to Colleen in particular, I would really love to know.

[Speaker 6]
Of course!

[Referee (James)]
Thank you. Okay, probably all of this could have been... That would be sweet.

Now that she got past... ...that, it goes to Morgan's Shipwreck. Shipwreck.

Whoops. Ah, yes. Shrewgrove of Dwarves.

This has been pleasant. Now, I did have somebody smuggle me a few crates of air of Morgan's Sarsaparilla. And I have to say, I appreciate it.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to see if it actually does protect me from swamp gases, but I'm not really affected by this anyway.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, my mouth just shivers.

[Referee (James)]
In any case, it tastes delicious enough to justify pounding the entire crate. And they were even so polite as to avoid giving me metal caps.

[(Nessie)]
That is sweet of them.

[Referee (James)]
Now, the most interesting thing about this is, and I believe some of you have been here, you see that giant hole in the center of there? That goes straight to the Underdark. It's not just a physical hole, but it's also a portal.

It slows your fall... ...such that you land deep within the Underdark. Secret.

Secret that, um, that Camtasia gave us was... ...where you land in the Underdark depends on the time of day. If you're in the morning, you'll land on the first layer.

If you're jumping at... ...in the afternoon, you'll land on the second layer. But if you go at night, you'll actually land on the third layer.

Where is it on the map? It's northwest of Volkvalki. And Vroman.

Oh, shit.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh...

[Referee (James)]
Can you throw me an insight check?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Everyone or just one? Everyone.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. Just one, why not? All right, yeah.

All right, so a bunch of you can see, um... There's this... ...and he breaches into his pouch and grabs, like, a fake Santa beard. He straps it on, and he looks like you're getting that sensation of just, like, you see somebody who is being tempted. He's getting ready to just, like, throw something down at you.

[Speaker 6]
Uh...

[Referee (James)]
He's not, like, he's not sure yet.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Blue? Yeah, probably. Maybe we should be like, wow, this is great.

We should skedaddle, eh? Nice beard. Compliment the beard.

[Referee (James)]
Thank you.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I received it as a gift myself. Nice. We don't want to have to deal with Underdark Sugaroth, so perhaps we should...

What was that? What was that? A moose.

[(Nessie)]
Uh... Should we... Should we give something to Morrigan's place?

And thanks for this smuggled drink. And maybe... Maybe we can work on some little trade.

I am an acquaintance of Morrigan. She's trying to distract him from his impish thoughts.

[Referee (James)]
Go ahead and, yeah, go ahead and make a persuasion.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I can make it better. I can make it better. If you roll...

If you... Oh, it's persuasion. If you roll badly on the persuasion, I can make it better.

You're fine.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, all right. Perfect, perfect. I was about to say...

I was about to put a 1d3 in chat.

[Mech]
Meanwhile, Rowan is just there, like, trying to...

[Referee (James)]
You have a plus five? You have a plus nine. Why were you like, oh, I don't know if I'm gonna make this, guys.

[(Nessie)]
I just... I asked how. Like, I was pretty sure I was gonna get it.

But also, my rolls sometimes suck, so...

[Kamon (Heart)]
Oh, no. It happens. Happens.

I don't know.

[(Nessie)]
But yes, to be the not one queen. I was also... They'll roll the same for my advantage roll.

Get the same damn number.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, you're probably... What should we... What should we give them?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
They don't seem like a stuff kind of people. They seem like a... Indulgence.

A green.

[(Nessie)]
I was thinking a green.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Right?

[(Nessie)]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't trust myself to say that word anymore.

[(Nessie)]
Green?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No. What word?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, so the... I said that the gem shrinks after indulging. And they...

They are... The fame... It goes a little bit more absent-minded for a moment.

Theories. Odd places. So, slightly larger than when you guys first began.

But only slightly. Its location is Orton. This one is interesting.

This used to worship a forgotten god. And they kept it up. I can't imagine why, but they kept it up.

I think Theresia just started wearing that god. Started wearing his skins.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Where are we? Orton, north.

[Referee (James)]
Orton, just follow the...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Oh crap.

[(Nessie)]
Oh crap.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Who's wearing the skin? They kept the name. Theresia.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, Theresia. Theresia. She's my...

She's my... Hasn't been responsive for a little while. At least she's still here.

So, pouring in... Or coming around. You guys, the fame waves his hand.

And you see two versions of Orton. One is in the material world and has a... Yeah, one is in the material world.

It just looks like a normal, typical village. Has a bunch of... Has, you know, just normal people kind of walking around here.

But the second version is in the world. This one has a spire stretching from the... Stretching from the ground a thousand feet in the air.

Has a big, what I can only describe as like an eye of Sauron on top. But it's a little bit more like a... It's a little bit more like a torch.

Yes, with this blue aurora flicking from it. And you guys can see, frozen in time, within the spire, there is Theresia puppeting Donable. Engaged in combat against the force of people who are cloaked in black.

Their banners are a... Some kind of canine chewing on... Chewing on pixies.

And the rest of the... You can see like several of these people, they look like adventurers. Pera will recognize.

And maybe Mimosa will as well. But definitely Pera will recognize Orvil. And Orvil and Armorin, I don't believe Altan will recognize Orvil and Armorin.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, so that's where they went.

[Referee (James)]
Mm-hmm. And their army is marching... Their army is marching from the lakeside.

Like standing on the lake and marching towards the... Marching towards a boat. It's the Woad and they are presently frozen.

[Mech]
Gold or green?

[(Nessie)]
More time shenanigans. Um...

[Mech]
I'm thinking gold.

[(Nessie)]
All right. I was going to throw blue in the Woad because everything's frozen in time.

[Mech]
Oh, okay.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
No, I would say gold.

[Mech]
Actually, yeah, let's go blue.

[(Nessie)]
She's my little chaotic nature coming out.

[Mech]
I think Horsea will appreciate it, she looks to me. I think so.

[Kamon (Heart)]
If we give gold, we're giving the magic items... ...to the fairy lady who's puppeting the god.

[Mech]
Oh, so blue then. All right.

[Referee (James)]
What's everybody's vote?

[Mech]
I'm doing blue.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't want to do blue. I'm fine with anything but gold. Um...

Yeah, I kind of want to do gold. Why? I don't know.

It just feels like the right choice.

[(Nessie)]
What is it?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Can we do a divination or something to ask about it? Oh, sure, yeah. Um, yeah, I guess I could, um, divination.

I can use divination because I haven't done that yet. This feels like a good one to divination.

[(Nessie)]
Yes. That was my thought too.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Since we're all kind of... I'm looking back on my notes on Theresa and they're all like, oh yeah, she killed someone. She was banished from the realm once.

Yeah, she's...

[Mech]
Yeah, so I feel like blue is a good option here.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah, um... I mean, there are also the people fighting her, but... So...

Chaos. Yes, which is my best option here?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Blue, gold, or green?

[Referee (James)]
Which is your best option?

[Mech]
Blue.

[(Nessie)]
Blue.

[Mech]
The gods have answered.

[(Nessie)]
Chaos wins! Rightfully so.

[Mech]
All as it should be.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right, we'll throw him to blue.

[Referee (James)]
And specifically, blue, if you wish to see Orville alive again.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
All right, blue.

[Mech]
All is right.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I don't want to kill people's characters off screen.

[Mech]
I mean, when... When the... That'll at least start working, like...

They would just, like, on their end, when they finally get around, just like, oh... There's a bunch of new monsters on the field.

[(Nessie)]
Oh shit, I didn't realize. That's funny. Well, that's a fun surprise.

I mean, we always package up the little eggs, and we say, Merry Christmas, we're sorry, kill this ASAP.

[Referee (James)]
We've made that...

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Maybe they'll work together to destroy it and become friends.

[Referee (James)]
And everybody has such a good time.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I mean, they have a Christmas story about the war.

[Referee (James)]
Everybody has such an easy time, whenever they open the, uh... Whenever they catch sights.

[Mech]
Ah, there we go. The funny drop amount, 666.

[Referee (James)]
No, you guys are on... Seven blue, seven gold, and six green.

[Mech]
Oh. Oh! Yeah, because...

Oh, okay, never mind. So we were already on the funny number, then. Okay.

And now, um... Zephaine's thing has grown back to, like... The gem has now, like, sealed itself inside of its crown.

[Kamon (Heart)]
I compliment the crown, say it looks real nice. It does. It does.

[Referee (James)]
All right, and Zephaine, at this point, he's like, Well, I'm ready to hand out... Probably hand out some... But I'm getting just about ready to...

To wrap up. Yeah. Sweet.

If... Huh. Yeah, I'm gonna check it out.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, let's do it. Sure.

[Referee (James)]
Okay, all right, let's do it.

[(Nessie)]
Let's do it. Let's follow your intuition.

[Referee (James)]
So he drags you guys back towards the search area.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, yeah? The what area? The search area with Mimosa's Tower.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Directly east. Thank you. To the right, yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, thank you. Such an old, nasty, nasty bit of business.

[(Nessie)]
Yes. We've fought in it... Before.

[Referee (James)]
I'm glad that old Scratch has moved on to Linwood Isle. Sometime, at some point... They restored the peace.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Okay, so... Oh, fuck, I could Divine Intervene that stuff. Which stuff?

The, uh... The giant soul fires.

[Referee (James)]
Ah. But that's not where he takes you guys to. He actually takes you further up the mountain.

And he says there's... Yeah. Okay, Whisper Sendings.

The Underwraiths. The crude world. I can't remember much about it.

I don't think... I don't think they like me. I don't think they like me, actually, at all.

But I'm... I'm... I know that they trade and find maps quite often.

And I might have been mistaken earlier. I... I think that...

I mean, they must not like... They couldn't... These...

These could not have been from them. No, no, I had a... I had another train of, uh...

I had another train of maps. And I think I got them... I must have, like, stolen them from this grove.

He seems to be really struggling with this. I have to describe who we want to race to, folks. It is a mountain that's been kind of carved upwards.

Has a great deal of aerial vegetation nearby. It does race into the clouds. It's south.

There is cloud-borne vegetation here. The clouds actually have substance in this area. It's protected from sight by a glamour.

But the fame is here, so... Commands of sort of things. He's able to dispel it and show it to everybody.

Which is why you guys didn't see it when traveling by. At the very, very top of the spires is a bright, shimmering comet. You're just gonna see people down there waving, like, waving their arms.

And Zephain at the moment is still waffling. Looks like he's trying to recall something.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Uh, god, what would it be to help him remember? Yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Like a... Oh, uh, he is about to make a wisdom saving throw.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Alright, I'll cast Bless on him. I'll give him Bardic Inspiration, being like, yeah, you can do it. The DC will be 30.

Oh, jeez. Does it have anything to do with charm or whatnot?

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Because then I can help. I can drop the Enhance Ability on us and give it to him. Do it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Yeah.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
You've written a wisdom.

[Mech]
Do it. I am curious, what is causing that? Is he just, like, is it just...

Is this a new phenomenon?

[Referee (James)]
Well, it seems to have been diminishing as far as... Every time you guys drop one of these blue... Drop something from the blue sack, drop one of these eggs, it appears to diminish him to some extent.

It's more attentive. His sentences are complete more often. He's more descriptive.

I mean, that's been the pattern so far.

[Mech]
Yeah, I'm just, like, thinking... Spell magic. What would that do?

[Referee (James)]
Yeah, the spell magic could fix something like this.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Would anything like Greater Restoration help?

[(Nessie)]
I feel like maybe a Wish spell or something.

[Referee (James)]
Powerful. Or Killing!

[(Nessie)]
Killing a certain...

[Referee (James)]
You know. You guys have interacted with curses. Actually, you guys have not interacted with curses.

There are persistent effects that...

[(Nessie)]
Mimosa... Solcrazier was cursed, right?

[Referee (James)]
Indeed. Then there's a second thing that's going on, which is re-education or brainwashing, which isn't quite the same as curses.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Is it, like, a modified memory? Because Greater Restoration tends to help with that, if I remember correctly.

[Referee (James)]
Okay. It's not, like I said, it's re-education. It's brainwashing.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay, yeah. Okay, so not like charms that cannot be modified. Really strong, so probably a 9th level fix.

Very unfortunate.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
We can research about it. Yeah, Mimosa's not going to let this go.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah. So...

[Referee (James)]
Any other things that they want to say to Zephain or do for him or...

[(Nessie)]
Oh, the only thing I can think of is asking questions, like... Oh, more Christmas cheer.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Go for it. Continue. Because last time, with, like, the help from the cookies and music, it helped with improving.

We don't quite have time for it, unfortunately. It didn't help, but they were just kind of neutral.

[Referee (James)]
Like, he enjoyed them, they didn't.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Okay. Regardless, would there be enough time for, like, a short Christmas story or something to help improve his... Yeah, then nothing else besides...

Yeah.

[(Nessie)]
Yeah, the only thing I can think of is Mimosa asking him what that comet is or...

[Referee (James)]
Well, it's a comet. A rather beautiful one. It reminds me of my...

[(Nessie)]
Uh-huh.

[Referee (James)]
I don't know. I just get the sensation that I shouldn't be here. Like, it's a trap.

That's why those people are waiting.

[(Nessie)]
Oh, maybe we should just move on, then. No. No?

Okay.

[Referee (James)]
I don't think I'll be able to... Moving on or not, I still want to. All right, last one.

[(Nessie)]
That's a crazy thought. We could land. I mean, I think we've buffed him as much as we can. I can't think of anything Mimosa could really do.

[Mech]
Can anybody boost wisdom saving throws through their class?

[(Nessie)]
I gave him a... That's what I was going to say. Like, Otter gave him Owl's Wisdom.

[Speaker 7]
I gave him Morphine.

[(Nessie)]
And then Bardic Inspiration. And Mimosa doesn't have any spells.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I think he said that he was going to get Bless.

[(Nessie)]
Bless?

[Mech]
Yeah, I did that, yeah.

[(Nessie)]
I mean, I guess she can, like, ask the journal about it, but I don't think that's going to be enough. She's going to do it in time.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Yeah, I think we've tapped out all our extra resources that I can think of.

[Referee (James)]
All righty, so what do we have? Let's just see how it falls. We have a plus two bone.

You guys restored his... There we go. Okay, so it's seven gold, seven blue, and six green.

One of your tracks, you gained one additional, basically restored a little bit of his presence once again. Which is what was happening every time you guys threw down an egg from the blue sack. Every time you took something from the supply sack, to your sack, that diminished.

You guys, on balance, yeah. Seven, and then plus one, and supplies for the sack, that was six. So I'm gonna have a plus two bonus.

And then we have plus one d4. That was advantage, blast, plus two, and then was there anything else?

[Mech]
The Bardic Inspiration.

[Referee (James)]
Bardic Inspiration, yes, which is what I...

[Mech]
D8.

[Referee (James)]
Oh, he has advantage. He does have advantage, that's good, because that was literally a natural one.

[Speaker 7]
Oh god.

[Mech]
It's like, regresses to be even worse.

[Referee (James)]
That's also wrong. Okay.

[(Nessie)]
Hell yeah.

[Referee (James)]
Yay. Immediately takes the carriage down, and goes to Sephain's Comet. Sephain's actual comet.

Just traces his hand along it. You see power flow into him, and... You see power flow into him.

The frost does advance from both hands by six hexes, which will actually encompass this area, but it no longer carries any effects like frostbite on the population.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay.

[Referee (James)]
Goes to Sephain. So really, it's gonna advance four hexes down. It's gonna advance it this way, I didn't change it this week.

And he shouts down to the people at Gléondor. He says, I'll be seeing you soon. Please keep faith in me.

Speeds you back to Sephain's palace. Takes you right through the future, gilding a sheet of ice currently gilding between the twin spires where the sun rises and falls, and it just goes straight through. Teleported back to Sephain's palace.

He says, well, okay. This is going to be something of a somber goodbye, I suppose. I have a few things to tell you.

I'm alive. Obviously, that comet is out of my door. Changed me in some capacity.

It's changed my whole state. The briefest moments of sailing. Tamed.

Don't even start. I'm just going to start rambling. The comet has to be destroyed.

It's either entered by both winter court or undercourt. Starbalance. Summer quarters.

The ting controls the maze. If that comet is left to live, it's a foe beyond, maybe not beyond Perra, but that's stretching as far as I can go. There are hordes of darkened kings underneath that comet, and you handle them by yourselves.

Probably need to get my size. Make sure of it, because I shouldn't want to sell. Even if it gets destroyed, though, I'm not going to stop pursuing the cross.

I do, unfortunately. But as long as that thing lives, always, and probably stays with me, I think this thing attains to eat me, and gives me some control over the palace. It's all I am.

[(Nessie)]
We'll take care of it.

[Referee (James)]
Looks like I have some business to- I'll tell you now, I'm an easier foe than you. So if worse comes to worse, you could always kill me instead.

[(Nessie)]
No. I'm stubborn. We'll fix it.

[Kamon (Heart)]
Just... Just for a quick clarification. So, you know, we do have to kill it with an army of a pretty big size, but I didn't quite catch if the fake hordes could or could not help with that.

[Referee (James)]
I didn't say it, and I doubt that my court will ever have a- Yeah, he said no one will get control over Samheed if the thing is there.

[(Nessie)]
That's all he said about the horde.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, okay. Hmm.

[Kamon (Heart)]
So I'm pretty sure they would want to kill it, no? Since no one would be able to take control of that there. Eh, we'll have to convince them.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
Right, so working on destroying that critter- How is- That's been Mimosa's thing this whole ride.

[(Nessie)]
She's got it. She's on it.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
And figuring out an army.

[(Nessie)]
Um, we have an army, dear sweet para.

[Perra (Otterstar)]
I know. What? You can finally use it.

Army? I just have an army. James gave me the option to buy an army, and I was like, yeah, I could probably have, like, these people for, like, you know.

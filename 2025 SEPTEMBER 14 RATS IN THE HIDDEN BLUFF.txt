[Speaker 11]
Oh, there it is. There we go, we're back.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I had my earbuds in, I was very confused as to why I couldn't hear you. Not my headset, I had my earbuds in. That's why I couldn't hear you.

Anyway, hi. So, can you ping people to see if others can join?

[Speaker 11]
No.

[Speaker 16]
Sure. Damn. Yeah, sure, I'll take the Elvinvor.

[Speaker 3]
Elvinvor! I don't think that's what it's called. Elvinver.

I'm an avor, motherfucker! Please don't.

[Speaker 11]
Get in my belly! Christ.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, so for your class feat, we have Blast Lock, Cover Fire, Crossbow, Crack Shot, Dual Weapon Reload, Hit the Dirt, Munitions Crafter, and Sword and Pistol, which is probably what you want to go with. Yeah, probably. So you're comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand, and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks with shots from your firearm.

When you make a successful ranged strike against an enemy within your reach of your one-handed firearm, that enemy is off-guard against your next melee attack. Yeah, let's go with that.

[Speaker 1]
Damn, just picking it immediately. Yeah, that's fair. No, I agree.

[Speaker 3]
We can get another one later. Yes. And then Paragon Feats.

[Speaker 11]
Ancestry Feats. What the fuck is a Paragon Feat? Oh, good lord.

That's...

[Speaker 3]
do I filter that for Elf, since that's what he is? That's like, just an extra.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, Ancestry. Yeah, that would be... But I think, um...

Come in at level one, or level three?

[Speaker 16]
At level one. I'm a level one character, I believe. Oh, or are you saying something else?

Sorry.

[Speaker 11]
My brain isn't working, apparently. Oh, that's fine. Alright.

They had me working until, uh, four last night. I don't know how to filter that one. I'm typing Elf into the text thing, but...

I'm not seeing anything.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, so I think it might be under the Traits field. Little... Traits?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, if you filter under Elf under Traits, then you're probably going to find it there. You do it in the regular text box.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, yeah, I'm dumb. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I didn't even see that one. Okay.

[Speaker 16]
What's a Magic Rider? That sounds weird.

[Speaker 1]
I need to put this at one. Yeah, there we go. There we go.

Which character does he have? I have Felcastro.

[Speaker 3]
Ficastro, not Felkai. Ficastro. F-I-C-A-S-T-R-O.

He's a gunslinger. And he's in my folder. Do you think we could get a folder for Scooter?

[Speaker 2]
I think we could get a folder for Scooter.

[Speaker 3]
I don't like having roommates.

[Speaker 12]
I am an independent woman!

[Speaker 3]
Um... Okay, we have Nimble Elf, I think?

[Speaker 1]
No, we have...

[Speaker 3]
Ah, we got...

[Speaker 1]
We got Elven Vor. Elven Verb. Nah, Vor.

I eat people. Yeah, Verb.

[Speaker 9]
Do you have the control?

[Speaker 10]
Do you see anything that catches your eye?

[Speaker 1]
Um... Not really. But I'm fucking, like, really dyslexic, so I'm...

I can barely even read most of these. The only one I can read is the name, Know Your Own. Okay, um...

We got Elven Lore and Elven... Lore... Viver...

Elven... Verb? Verb.

So, Unwavering... Uh... Mean?

Mine? I don't know. Um...

Unwavering... Unwavering... Main.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Um... Your mystic control at meditation allows you to resist external influence upon your consciousness.

Whenever you are affected by a mental effect that lasts at least two rounds, you can reduce the duration by one round. You still require natural sleep, but you treat your save throws against the effect that would cause you to fall asleep as one degree of success better. This protects only against sleep effects, not from other forms of falling unconscious.

Um... Oh, hell yeah. What about Nimble Elf?

Because that one gives you five extra feet of movement.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, why not? It's a quick and... It's a quick and dirty...

...feet. Damn, James, you just let one rip.

[Speaker 15]
No, it's my chair.

[Speaker 1]
No, I know. What type of chair are you sitting in? An office chair, uh...

[Speaker 2]
It's an office... It's a... ...whoopee cushion.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. A little teenager. Yeah.

No, I got this new office chair, and it's like... It hurts to sit in. It's like it was...

[Speaker 3]
I got one that was, um... Like, one of the spinny kinds.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
A really shitty one, and... Yeah. I fucked it up.

I don't know how I fucked it up. I raised it too high, and I cannot get it to raise back down. So it hurts to sit on, so I just have not used it.

I have not touched my desktop in, like, almost a year now.

[Speaker 13]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I've just been using my laptop. It's easier to, like...

Just... I don't know. I can play D&D on my bed, you know?

[Speaker 2]
That's fair. That's what I've been doing. I've been using...

Ever since I got this laptop from wholesale, that's what I've been using, like, 90% of it. That's good. It's like, I can put it on the kitchen counter, and...

[Speaker 3]
My groceries are arriving now, BRB.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hell yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, we're joined. Hart, hi!

[Speaker 8]
Hey.

[Speaker 3]
Hello.

[Speaker 4]
Mostly here just to greet. What's happening? I saw there's a ping for a game, but...

Spontaneous?

[Speaker 2]
Hello! Spontaneous gaming.

[Speaker 4]
Hello. Hello.

[Speaker 1]
How are ya?

[Speaker 2]
Good. Especially since last game I killed somebody.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, fuck yeah, we love murder! Yay, murder!

[Speaker 2]
Trying to reassure... Trying to reassure Autostar, like, no, no, no, I'm not actually... I'm not actually, like, trying to kill, like, all the fucking players or anything like that.

It's just... You know, it's funny, because, you know, not as many people die in 5e or whatever. And there's certain situations, like, hey, there's more resurrection opportunity.

I just think it would be more fun. And then, like, another person dies. Get really close to dying.

[Speaker 1]
I think the first ever game I played with you, James, you killed my character off. No! Because I flew too high.

It wasn't the first...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah! That wasn't the first one, but I definitely...

[Speaker 1]
No, I think it was the first one, because it was the first... It wasn't the first game I played with you. It was the first one I played on that character.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes. No, that's what I was going to clarify.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
It was your first time with that character, and he definitely died.

[Speaker 1]
Which was a completely valid death. I can't even... That was completely valid.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I don't know. I look back on that and I'm like, well...

The other players had plenty of foreshadowing, because they had been... Every journey into the Cloud Forest was met with peril and horror. And it was always a horror...

It turned every session that went into that region of the world... Was a horror game. Unambiguous.

They were warned. You were not warned, though, so I didn't...

[Speaker 12]
No, man, it put a good...

[Speaker 1]
I don't want to say damper, because damper is not the right term. It's a good thing. Because...

I don't look back at that session as a player, as a good experience, as how I played it. So I treat that death as a reminder to be a better player. Oh.

Yeah. So, good experience.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'm glad you got something out of it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I was looking back on it with regret. I'm like, oh...

[Speaker 1]
I like it with some regret, but you know, man, you gotta take the punches. You gotta take the lumps. Yeah.

Oh, so I finally owned my house. I finally got that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, congratulations, dude.

[Speaker 1]
That's excellent. Yeah. Now I can buy all the guns I want.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can't really have... It's a weird thing to think about, but I would not want to start a firearms collection in my apartment.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
You trying to get out now?

[Speaker 2]
What have you been up to this weekend, Heart?

[Speaker 4]
In general? Mostly just hanging out with my family. Because the job I was signing up for hasn't given my schedule yet, my parents were just like, what if you went and signed up for other jobs in the meantime?

And I'm like, okay, sure. So mostly looking at other work to get into. And I guess trying to fix my miserable sleep schedule.

But otherwise, that's about it.

[Speaker 1]
What work field are you in?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, mostly in film and theatre. Oh, hell yeah. Thank you.

Yeah. I will say it is a bit harder due to the fact a lot of things are like, you need three to five years of experience, and I did just graduate. Oh, hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I wanted to go into prop design, but then my dad shot down my dreams. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
What are you in now?

[Speaker 1]
But now he's dead! I'm kidding. I'm not kidding that he's dead.

I'm kidding. I'm kidding that he can no longer stop me.

[Speaker 4]
Best of luck on whatever you are up to.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just working at a supermarket currently, man. Like, I don't give a shit. They've been working me regular though.

I worked until four last night. Oh, kitty. Good luck.

Yeah. It's a very fluffy cat.

[Speaker 4]
Oh! Maelstrom Mansion.

[Speaker 2]
Probably that you'd trap behind the thing and then, like, there.

[Speaker 1]
It's a cat. It's an old god. It can do whatever it wants.

[Speaker 3]
I have returned.

[Speaker 13]
Hello, Astra.

[Speaker 3]
Hello! Hello. I have to grab a burrito in like five minutes, but for now, I am here.

[Speaker 1]
The burrito you said you were gonna stick your dick in, Astra? I did, yes.

[Speaker 15]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
You're more vulgar than me sometimes.

[Speaker 10]
If you can't tell, I love burritos. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I have never had a burrito. Never? Never, not once.

Wow. Man, I've had a hamburger exactly twice.

[Speaker 2]
That's like... He's with a bunch of Nazis and he's spying on them. And he, like, orders three drinks and the guy, like, immediately...

[Speaker 3]
Inglourious bastards. I just watched that the other day.

[Speaker 2]
You watch that every week? Like, you know...

[Speaker 3]
Such a great movie. I watched it the other day.

[Speaker 1]
You watch it, like, every damn week. It's like every...

[Speaker 3]
No, I think they just added it. No, you've heard me talk about wanting to watch it again. Because they just added it to Netflix, like, a month after I complained that it wasn't on there.

No, so...

[Speaker 4]
You manifested it.

[Speaker 1]
I manifest destiny. But no, the reason I've only had a hamburger twice... Was the first time I had a hamburger...

It was forced on me and I had to eat it. The second time... It was forced on me and I had to eat it, so...

I have a hamburger PTSD. Um... I'm...

I... Yeah. I also don't...

Yeah, I also don't eat tacos.

[Speaker 3]
I just don't like tacos. I had somebody trick me into eating frog legs one time. Oh.

[Speaker 13]
Oh. I had a guy...

[Speaker 3]
To anybody else, that would be okay. But, like, to me... To me, someone who loves frogs...

Why would you do that?

[Speaker 2]
Like, oh, they're actually... Oh, no, they're not frog legs. They're snail legs.

[Speaker 1]
Ugh, gross. Uh... I've...

I've almost tried pao tang, but... I couldn't work myself up to that one. It's not bad.

It just... The mouthfeel on that...

[Speaker 3]
Every time I go to a restaurant that has those little baby octopus things... On the... At, like, the...

The buffet... I always get one, meaning to try it. But I'm always, like, way too scared to.

[Speaker 1]
As long as it isn't alive, you're good.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but, like, the texture... I feel like it'd be rubbery and gross. Oh, yeah, it definitely is.

[Speaker 1]
That's entirely fair.

[Speaker 3]
That's part three.

[Speaker 2]
It's kind of like shrimp. Like a shrimp. Oh?

Last time I had one.

[Speaker 9]
Kind of like seafood. That's also another thing. That's fair.

[Speaker 2]
You have a... I'm not allowed to have a ton of sugar or a ton of fats, but I'm not allowed to cut out sugar completely.

[Speaker 13]
Why?

[Speaker 2]
Why aren't you allowed to cut out sugar?

[Speaker 13]
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not literally exploding. It's just, like, a bunch of... Basically, it got really stressed out.

Every time I did keto, it would get super stressed out because it would have to cut out itself, and it would have to burn all the fat that I was eating because I was eating, like, really high-fat, high-iron meals. So it's just, like, constantly fucking stressing it out. And then every time some of those cells explode in the process, then it's less able to take the stuff coming in.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. So it's just a volcano that wants to kill itself. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And now I feel better.

[Speaker 3]
So you're safe and on your shoulder? Hm.

[Speaker 2]
Like a venti hot white mocha. Blonde shots and gangster whipped cream. And it's like, oh, that's enough sugar for three days.

You're getting every single day. I'm like, all right, well...

[Speaker 1]
And, like, $90. That couldn't have been... Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Oh. Oh, here. I'll be right back.

Burrito!

[Speaker 12]
Two people playing today. Hm. I win.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you will? I will be very frank. I probably need to start going to bed, because it's almost three in the morning.

I did just want to say hi. Okay.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yes. It was great meeting you, Scooter. I don't think we've talked before.

[Speaker 1]
No, we have. I've played a couple games with you before. I just haven't played...

[Speaker 4]
I'm insane. I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's completely fine. It's been, like, a year. Ah.

Yeah.

[Speaker 12]
At least, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Remind me? Remind me? Because my brain probably was just like, you know what?

Last year. Whatever. Go ahead.

Remind you of what? When... What did we play in together?

[Speaker 1]
We played D&D.

[Speaker 15]
And... Ah!

[Speaker 1]
I think I was, uh... Beebec.

[Speaker 4]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
And Brian the Birb.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I met Brian the Birb.

[Speaker 1]
Brian the Birb did not last long.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, he died immediately. But I do think I know Beebec.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah. Which became one of Astral's slaves.

What did? Uh, Beebec. Beebec?

[Speaker 3]
When did that happen? I didn't enslave him.

[Speaker 15]
He became one of my hirelings. You monster, you enslaved him.

[Speaker 3]
He became one of my hirelings, you drama queen. It was really fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
Because Brian the Birb, like, DM'd me. He was like, can we roleplay, like, the auction? And I was like, that's...

I... What? What in the world is this coming from?

Crazy.

[Speaker 3]
I messed that up here. Being ganged up on.

[Speaker 1]
I'm being set up here, I didn't do this. No, you did every word of it. Every damn sentence, we have it on tape.

[Speaker 4]
What burrito did you get, Frogatha?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Tofu. With other things in it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, tofu.

[Speaker 3]
You're not a fan? He's not a fan of anything that isn't, um...

[Speaker 1]
Bread and cheese.

[Speaker 3]
Pizza without pizza sauce on it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, like... Like, we had this discussion a year and a half ago. The original pizza didn't have sauce.

It had rose water.

[Speaker 15]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Exactly. I'm eating it more traditional than western pizza.

Of course, of course. It also gives me heartburn.

[Speaker 4]
What's your favorite?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Mine? Yes, yours.

Cheese pizza with no sauce. That's the only type I eat.

[Speaker 4]
Sick. You know what? I think I've heard that before.

Genuinely, I think that order is what's, like, fully reminded me of the conversations we've had. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 12]
Anyway.

[Speaker 4]
Nice talking to you again. It was pretty good. Agatha, it is almost three.

I just wanted to say hi. Oh, you're saying?

[Speaker 16]
Nah, she's going.

[Speaker 4]
It genuinely depends on how long this is going to be, because I do need sleep. I'm very tired.

[Speaker 1]
Well, James, we're into the Void, so...

[Speaker 4]
We'll stick up over it. Yes. If this...

Planning in advance is fine, but I have stayed up too long. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, it's fair. Yeah, it's fair. Yeah, goodbye.

Goodbye. Goodbye.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Have a good game.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, let's go murder some orphans.

[Speaker 2]
I'm kidding.

[Speaker 1]
Speaking of which, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 6]
Oh...

[Speaker 3]
A tutorial dungeon?

[Speaker 1]
Not murder orphans. Yeah, a tutorial dungeon.

[Speaker 3]
Was that a reference to that... To the guy that we... We played a game with that one time?

What? The guy that, like, was obsessed with all of his enemies eating orphans?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, it was... Yeah, and then he had a squirrel stapler. Yeah.

And then...

[Speaker 3]
I don't think that guy was... James, do you remember the guy who, like, you kind of booted because nobody liked him?

[Speaker 2]
There were a few of those.

[Speaker 3]
Nobody liked him, because he was... I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
He tricked... He put me in one of the... He put my character in one of the worst demon packs, probably on the server.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, VilePirate!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah!

[Speaker 3]
All of his enemies were, like, weirdly obsessed with eating and killing orphans.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well, it was so weird, and he kept on mentioning a game called Squirrel Stapler.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. People who eat orphans are pretty... They're bad.

In fact, they are villainous.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, indeed. Yeah, but, like, I was trying to recruit them... before they started talking about eating orphans.

And then I still tried to recruit them.

[Speaker 2]
The villains, not the... Okay. Alright, that was gonna be my next question.

Not the orphans.

[Speaker 1]
No. Not the orphans.

[Speaker 2]
No, we waited a couple years. The orphans.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. Their hands are too small. They can't...

They can't die in glorious battle.

[Speaker 2]
They know nothing about squirrels.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And then... Yeah.

What was that character's name that died to, um... Or got... That attacked as a demon?

What was his name?

[Speaker 10]
Brian.

[Speaker 1]
Brian. Then what was the bird's name? It was another bee name.

They were all bee names.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think a tutorial dungeon would be good for him. Yeah. Otherwise, he's gonna be...

lost in the woods.

[Speaker 2]
Super stupid. Yep. That seems...

That seems right. Oh, shit.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I have the IQ of a goldfish. Unreal Zone.

I'm currently scrolling up in the character creation tab to find out what my character's name was. I don't think it's in there, though. That sucks.

[Speaker 3]
Basically, Ficastro is just a gunslinger.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
We can make up lore and shit for him later.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna have a dairy cow name White Utter. Please don't. Don't look that up.

Nothing dirty.

[Speaker 2]
I gotta look it up.

[Speaker 1]
White Utter was the name was the English name of the cow that Fidel Castro had. So, yeah. You know.

[Speaker 2]
Why not? The name of... I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Some weird porn.

[Speaker 2]
I was gonna say, like, CIA operation, like, subproject... MKUltra subproject 185. Fuckin'...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. But no, I swear I'm gonna watch this. Project Planet.

[Speaker 2]
No, if it was... If it was this MKUltra subproject, then White Utter would've been like inject this compound that has similar properties to LSD into a cow and see if it comes out with milk.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it did. Oddly enough, the cow did produce, like, a staggering amount of milk. Like, a lot of milk.

[Speaker 6]
That's why it was his favorite cow.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, why his favorite cow. The guy who really liked milk.

[Speaker 3]
You know what? I can understand having a favorite cow. Cows are basically giant field puppies.

They have best friends. They play. They love playing.

They're very playful creatures.

[Speaker 2]
They're very nice.

[Speaker 3]
I think one day when I get rich and famous, I'm gonna retire... I'm gonna retire to, like, a house in the middle of nowhere with a big field with, like, three cows or two cows. And we're just gonna be besties.

[Speaker 1]
No, you need an alpaca farm.

[Speaker 2]
Alpacas are not nice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Other than a llama farm. Llamas are the ones...

What am I thinking about that has a hump? A camel? A camel.

Yeah.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Llamas are generally considered nice. Unless their name is Carl.

[Speaker 1]
Carl! That kills people, Carl!

[Speaker 2]
And I stabbed him 36 times in the chest.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That's heresy, Carl!

[Speaker 2]
...into this lovely little...

[Speaker 3]
Um, can I bring... Arsonist Goblin?

[Speaker 15]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Uh, down there. Move your cursor to where you want me to place my thingy, James.

[Speaker 3]
You've been placed.

[Speaker 1]
It won't let me move.

[Speaker 3]
Where are we going?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there he goes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he kind of put himself somewhere and I was like, Oh, well that must be where we're supposed to go!

[Speaker 1]
It won't let me move. Oh, there we go. Zooming.

You might want to, like, darken that shit again. I saw nothing. As long as you don't put children behind doors, we're good.

That's not a dig at you, James. That's a dig at Astro. Or Frogratha.

[Speaker 2]
What did you do to the kids?

[Speaker 3]
There was a kid hiding in a storage closet, because they were raiding the fucking...

[Speaker 1]
...area. Is that the same session where I, uh, knocked out a raider, named him Snowball, and made him my pet?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that is.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I miss Snowball. Every day. That was such a weird session.

[Speaker 3]
Never DMing again.

[Speaker 1]
Snowball ruined it for you.

[Speaker 2]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Well, I kept on knocking out people, I hid behind a door and kept on landing, knocking out hits on people with a shovel.

[Speaker 5]
I was way too lenient with him.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, way, way too lenient.

[Speaker 5]
The end of the story is, just kill him if you don't like him.

[Speaker 1]
No, you gotta give me at least one warning. One near-death murder.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, when you get to this dungeon, dwarves call out and they say, there's two of them at the entrance saying that their position was overrun by a swarm of rats. And there's many large rats inside as well. They managed to connect to the old residential district of the Underground.

Actually, this is one of the sessions that, um, I never played in this. I did play in this dungeon, but Vile Tyrant made like a separate wing of that dungeon, which these dwarves have been trying to get into. A bunch of rats come from it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no!

[Speaker 3]
Speaking of rats.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Man, you just gave me memories of the boss fight from that session.

[Speaker 2]
No! You did not get to fight him at level one!

[Speaker 1]
Fuck! Fuck! Do you know the boss fight from that session?

It was a fucking, like... It was... We...

It was fucked, man. It was a rat abomination that turned out to be an eldritch horror.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it was... It was the rat king, no?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it was the rat king.

[Speaker 2]
It was the rat king.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
This world has many rat kings.

[Speaker 3]
Should I bring Paris? Since she is level three.

[Speaker 2]
You can bring, uh... Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Just gonna go for like a couple of encounters, drop the plot hook, and then I'm gonna take some Adderall and finally try to wake up. Or work.

[Speaker 1]
Fair enough. And then we can schedule the next session for three nights! Three years away!

Probably a month away. A week away.

[Speaker 2]
Just play together this week!

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I wish.

[Speaker 3]
He has a part-time job that he's completely dedicated to.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck you, man! You work me to the fucking bone! You don't understand the struggle, okay?

[Speaker 2]
It really... Honestly... I'm not trying to lie...

It does... There's something about part-time jobs that take up way more time than they ever should.

[Speaker 1]
Man, literally... So they're keeping me right under... The...

They're keeping me like one hour under full-time, currently, so they don't have to give me medical benefits.

[Speaker 9]
Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 2]
Remember, uh... Workplace health insurance isn't free. You still have to pay for that plan.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but...

[Speaker 2]
Which I didn't know for a while. I was like...

[Speaker 1]
Why are they taking all my money?

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. I didn't sign up for it. Very intentionally.

It's like... I'm not... It's like, alright.

Well, I can have myself and my girlfriend here. With the same plan. They're like, $500.

Two of us per month. I'm like, man... Mm-mm.

[Speaker 1]
Man, I'm still under my mom's insurance until I'm 26. I'm golden.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, that's... I'm 28 now. And it was, uh...

It's so fucking crazy that... I can't just stay like that.

[Speaker 13]
Is that a grand piano?

[Speaker 2]
Grand piano?

[Speaker 13]
Yeah. Grand piano in the corner.

[Speaker 2]
It is. It is! It is a grand piano.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Are these baddies?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, baddies. Some baddies.

[Speaker 3]
Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Some baddies. There's one frost-covered rat. One which is also of a large size.

Well, it's small. But that's very large for a rat.

[Speaker 1]
Are these humans or rats?

[Speaker 2]
They're rats. This one is also... Oh.

Oh, what about this one? Oh, they're all... They're all of small size.

You could add yourselves to an issue here. How? You just gotta right-click your token.

And click Combat State.

[Speaker 1]
Toggle Combat State, yes?

[Speaker 2]
Toggle Combat State. Yeah, that little Sword and Shield icon.

[Speaker 3]
You can also double-click on your character to open up your character sheet. And it'll say Initiative by the word Perception.

[Speaker 2]
For some reason, right now with our token settings, that doesn't let him... Or it often doesn't let people... It often does not add that Initiative check.

[Speaker 3]
Huh. That's how I do it all the time.

[Speaker 2]
Did I do it? No, you didn't. You just have to...

Then you go over to Encounter... In fact, actually, do it the way... Do it the way Farnetha told you.

And see if it... Because now I just did it wrong.

[Speaker 1]
Say again, Astro?

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Actually, here. So go up in the top tabs here where it's chat messages, encounters, actors, all that stuff.

Click on the second one, which is the two swords crossing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Encounters.

[Speaker 3]
And you see the little dice by your name?

[Speaker 1]
Roll Initiative.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, there you go.

[Speaker 1]
Do I roll it with the plus five as normal?

[Speaker 3]
Yep, if it says plus five, that's what you roll.

[Speaker 1]
I got an 11!

[Speaker 3]
We both got an 11.

[Speaker 12]
Do we play Rollies?

[Speaker 2]
Explosive Wrath is not supposed to be there. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Damn, a 25!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it seems. So the... Giant Brass here immediately turns...

And he's very upset. Got one action moving.

[Speaker 8]
Spell card, what the fuck?

[Speaker 2]
Here's... I have hit you for damage.

[Speaker 13]
What the fuck? No.

[Speaker 1]
Go away, ruler! I'm trying to measure!

[Speaker 2]
You gotta make me a... PC14... Fortitude to save.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. My necklace fell off at the place I just... Got done pet sitting.

Alright, I pass.

[Speaker 2]
And then he's gonna get even angrier because he sees a foreign rat.

[Speaker 13]
I missed. This rat is British.

[Speaker 2]
This one? Oh, shoot. I don't have enough room to get through that door.

Alright. He's gonna be... He's gonna sit here and be upset.

[Speaker 13]
Aww.

[Speaker 2]
Unless I could, like... I don't know, jump. Oh, I know what I'm...

Oh, he did not add Karras to initiative.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I didn't. I completely forgot about Karras. Sorry, girl.

There we go.

[Speaker 13]
Damn, a 16. Good for you. Oh, there's the ruler.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. I am going to turn off the penalty for unintelligible because they are both rats. Did not succeed.

And I kind of have to jump. Alright, I found it. A long jump is 2x.

Alright, nope. Don't worry about it then.

[Speaker 3]
Leave Bernie alone. I can't get another Bernie if Bernie dies.

[Speaker 2]
Karras.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... I don't play Karras as often as I used to.

Um... I'll be familiarizing with you.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Um... Well.

I will... A step back? No, I'm not.

Shh, bells.

[Speaker 10]
These bolts.

[Speaker 7]
12 damage. And then I will... Oh, you know what?

[Speaker 8]
I will...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, nice! Okay. And then my last action...

Will be to... Draw my coat pistol.

[Speaker 1]
Because you're a rat. Uh... Am I able to get past, uh...

Arsonist Goblin?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can move past, uh, friends.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Can I get to the... Yep.

Yep, that's what they're moving.

[Speaker 1]
Let me move! It will do in a second.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to move you there. There you go. You want to make sure that you're not on measurement controls.

You want to be on token controls.

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm on token controls. Yeah, I'm on token controls. Now, currently.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you know what? I think you're moving into a wall. There's a wall intersecting your path.

[Speaker 1]
Uh... No, it just doesn't give me... Permission to move.

Anyway. Uh... Maybe Astral still has the permissions.

Uh... I'm gonna... I'm gonna, uh...

My dueling sword. Uh... Melee Australian Sword canceled as you must target...

[Speaker 3]
Uh, so hit... Hover over the enemy you want to select. And you can either right-click it twice, or you can hit the letter T, and it'll target it.

[Speaker 1]
There we go! A 13.

[Speaker 2]
That misses. Damn. Do another attack?

Yep. Uh, you want to click the second button, but you'll see, uh... It'll be like a thing for multi-attack penalty.

[Speaker 3]
It'll say M.A.P. Minus... One, maybe? Um...

Damn. Two! Now, you also have a hero point.

So, if you would like to, you can right-click on that. I am good. I will end the turn.

And you could re-roll it if you want. Alright, Arsonist Goblin.

[Speaker 10]
Yeah. We'll do that.

[Speaker 3]
Damn.

[Speaker 15]
That's rough.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that sucks. Uh, alright. I don't know how Bernie works.

Can I... One action to make Bernie... Do something with two actions?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so you do... You give him... You spend one action commanding him, so...

Which gives him two actions. Okay, so he can move here... Ah!

[Speaker 3]
Bernie, you will...

[Speaker 2]
Justice! And he takes a lot of damage from fire.

[Speaker 9]
Really? His turn.

[Speaker 15]
Nice try.

[Speaker 2]
First, attack against Bernie.

[Speaker 3]
That's rude.

[Speaker 15]
Dang.

[Speaker 8]
There we go.

[Speaker 3]
I'm terrified of losing Bernie.

[Speaker 2]
Understandable. Alright, Garrus.

[Speaker 3]
Garrus? I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna shoot him.

No ammo? Did I... Okay, there it is.

And then...

[Speaker 2]
And does damage.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. And then I'm gonna activate my dog. And pull my dog onto the screen.

[Speaker 12]
You have to activate it?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I can only have him for six hours once a week. Weird custody thing, but you know.

[Speaker 15]
Ah, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I should have asked. Oh, sorry. So, while I'm on my turn...

Do I have to... Isn't it an action to unsheathe the sword?

[Speaker 2]
I assume that you have at least something in hand, typically.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. I will...

I'll attempt to hit... And then hit map again.

[Speaker 2]
Why does he only have a plus four to hit?

[Speaker 1]
Because I'm a pistol guy, but I'm using my sword.

[Speaker 2]
You can attempt to use your pistol as well, if you'd like.

[Speaker 1]
I'll use map as a map pistol.

[Speaker 3]
So, yeah. 16! Nice!

There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Damage. Damage. Four.

Okay. Now, I have a question. I still have one action, correct?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Technically, the enemy's dead.

[Speaker 2]
Well, the encounter is about to end.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
With...

[Speaker 1]
I was gonna reload and strike the rat.

[Speaker 2]
You just need to make me some... That saves.

[Speaker 14]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, Bernie! Do I hit the basic reflex thing?

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, thank god, Bernie.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, Bernie succeeds. Taking half damage, which...

[Speaker 3]
He's unconscious, which I can heal him immediately, hopefully. If that works on elementals.

[Speaker 2]
Uh-huh. And for Castro...

[Speaker 9]
Six damage. Damn! I'm gonna attempt this.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Bernie. Why won't it let me?

But yeah, I don't have a heal item.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, I have to end encounter.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 14]
Draw your wounds.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, Charizard.

[Speaker 1]
How do I reload? Do I have to manual... Do I have to click a button to reload my pistol?

Or does it auto-reload?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I'm wasting a...

[Speaker 2]
...pistol. Reload one.

[Speaker 1]
So does that mean I have to push a button? Or does that mean it auto-reloads and I take a... ...minus one action...

...in combat... ...when I reload?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think you could just say that you reload.

[Speaker 2]
In between encounters, that'll mind if you... ...reload. Yeah.

[Speaker 11]
And then I will reload.

[Speaker 1]
Can I search the rat for ratty goodness?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know why I kept pausing.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 2]
What do I need to roll? Well, go to... This is how we're going to show you exploration.

[Speaker 15]
Hey.

[Speaker 2]
Go to the party sheet. Party sheet.

[Speaker 3]
What's that look like? So, click on... You know what, we have to drag our characters into the party.

So, go to the actors tab. Select your character and just drag them up the... ...little scrolly thing. And drag them all the way to the top where it says the party. Just slot them under... Yep, there you go.

Perfect. So, the party sheet is the little... So, there's a little folder...

...beside the words the party. And then there's a little paper beside the folder. Hit the paper that says open sheet.

Okay. And the overview, exploration, and stash. Do you see that?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Stash.

[Speaker 12]
Stash.

[Speaker 13]
Okay. I'm back.

[Speaker 2]
And this is where we come to things like exploration activities.

[Speaker 1]
So, do you want me to click on stash or exploration? Exploration. Exploration.

Okay, I am there.

[Speaker 9]
Never once been in this tab.

[Speaker 2]
There's a bunch of stuff and you can browse the actions that already exist... ...with the browse button. But there's a ton of stuff like, you know, search, scout.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not going to lie. At the bottom, I think there's also a basic action macro.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea what you guys are talking about. All I see is slots.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Okay, so... Dude, I don't think he has the basic...

Let's show him how to get to the basic action macro.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. There we go. You still got to show me.

I accidentally clicked something and it brought me to the explore tab on Focastro.

[Speaker 3]
So, down... Do you see on the very bottom of your screen where it has like a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? It's like a hotbar?

No. The first...

[Speaker 15]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
The first one should say basic action macros.

[Speaker 1]
Does it?

[Speaker 16]
No.

[Speaker 1]
It says compile macros 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 0.

[Speaker 2]
He's got to go to browse macro directory, which is like a little folder that's right next to the macros tab.

[Speaker 1]
Browse. There we go. Do I got to click basic action macro?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, drag that into the first one.

[Speaker 1]
All right. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
And then you can click it, open it up. And there's a lot of... I know it looks like sensory overload.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, lord.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, sensory overload, however. Only some of these are important. You just have to look through them.

So, we're looking for seek. So, that would be on the third row. Or third column.

And it would be with the S's. And which tab?

[Speaker 1]
Which tab?

[Speaker 3]
In encounter, I believe.

[Speaker 1]
Encounter, okay. Third S. Third.

Third row or third? Third column. Third column.

Seek.

[Speaker 13]
Plus five. Click it? Yep.

Roll? Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1]
I got a seven from doing so bad. I rolled a two there.

[Speaker 2]
That's okay. You do not notice anything in addition to the sounds of commotion upstairs.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I was searching the rat.

[Speaker 2]
That's right, you were searching the rat.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was trying to, like, take its skin.

[Speaker 2]
While you're looking at it, there is a... There's 44 silver.

[Speaker 15]
Hey, fuck yeah.

[Speaker 2]
On the rat? On the remains of the rat. The icy rat, when it exploded, had a bunch of coins.

Like shrapnel. Like a fucking... Like a claymore.

So, add that to the party stash?

[Speaker 1]
So, should we add those to the party stash?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[Speaker 1]
Silver, 44, right? 44.

[Speaker 9]
Add coins. Here we go.

[Speaker 1]
Can I search the other rat? That's...

[Speaker 2]
That's not bulletproof.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay, cool. No, it's not. Kitty.

I hate to be that guy, but can I... Okay, is this a private residence or is this an abandoned house? Or an abandoned structure?

This is a dungeon. Okay, so can I go steal everything from that piano?

[Speaker 2]
You can go into the piano, sir.

[Speaker 3]
What could you possibly find at a piano to steal?

[Speaker 1]
Wire. I can't move. So weird.

[Speaker 6]
Can you take a picture of...

[Speaker 3]
Can you take a picture of your screen for me? And send it to me?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but my Discord will get angry at me because I don't have Nitro.

[Speaker 3]
Just take a picture with your phone and send it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, yeah, you got a point. You can send screenshots. Screenshots don't take up that much.

Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. It gets mad at me.

[Speaker 15]
What the hell?

[Speaker 1]
Do you want me to put that in... Can I just send it to you privately? Send it privately?

Oh, hell. Yeah, it gets angry at me every damn time.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. Can I see the top right under the anvil? Or the top left under the anvil?

[Speaker 1]
Under what anvil?

[Speaker 3]
Where's your HUD? What the fuck?

[Speaker 12]
What HUD?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, exactly. Send that to James, actually. Put that into voice overflow.

Above me.

[Speaker 1]
Voice overflow.

[Speaker 3]
That's so weird. Button did you press?

[Speaker 12]
I didn't press any buttons! It came like this. Literally.

[Speaker 3]
Did you just not take a picture of the sides of your screen?

[Speaker 12]
What? What screen?

[Speaker 3]
Did you take a picture of the sides of your screen? Or did you just take a picture straight down the middle?

[Speaker 2]
Joder, do you ever kill fights in vertical mode? Come on, man.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit, you're right, I forgot that. Well, I didn't want to show you my messy ass chat.

[Speaker 2]
This is civilization. We fucking, we're horizontal here.

[Speaker 1]
I probably record fights and shit.

[Speaker 2]
That's very well, like, how every fight on Worldstar. Nobody ever does it horizontally, so you can't see shit.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I think my phone's angry. Oh, okay, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So, um, get rid of... Behind the character sheet, just drag that to the side.

And behind it is what we want to see. Also, it's very funny that your fucking phone has a watermark. Fuck you.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what do I need to select?

[Speaker 3]
It should, at the very top, under the anvil, it should have a little person which says token control. I'm on that already. Okay, and then the, a little square.

With... Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
He was on measurement control. Yeah! The ruler.

[Speaker 3]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
There we go, now that's resolved.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what do I need to, what do I, do I need to do? Seek again?

[Speaker 2]
Sure, sure. I'm going to let Paris and Arshamish Goblin roll in exploration first.

[Speaker 3]
Is it still Arshamish? No, it's not still Arshamish. Um, I guess, uh, I don't want Bernie to die.

I don't know how to keep Bernie from dying.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, he healed him. That's a good start.

[Speaker 3]
That's a good start, but he's still missing like six hit points. Those six hit points could be life or death.

[Speaker 1]
I can't believe that rat hit me with my 18 AC.

[Speaker 3]
I have soothe I could use. You know what? Screw it.

Heal. Up I heal. Um, Arshamish Goblin is going to look for, I don't know, look around.

See if there's, uh, anything in this area before we move on. Anything of note, anything to tell us what is going on here.

[Speaker 2]
You're looking across them. You see a little, each of these rat corpses has a small rat statue inside of them.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I take it. Um, what are, what are these rat? Do I know anything about these rat statues?

Do they mean anything to Arshamish Goblin or, or, uh, Karis?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, to Karis, Karis, you feel really bad being around. Uh oh. They're very, they're very draining.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. So it's like made of like cold iron or something.

[Speaker 2]
Not quite. It's like the same, uh, fey are very like oriented towards creativity and dreams and things like that. Glamour.

Uh, the stuff of emotion. Dross. Uh, this is, do I have to make people look at our comment check or something?

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Oh god. Um.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
This shit sucks.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, this shit sucks. Arshamish Goblin would have done better in that one.

[Speaker 2]
They can, the only thing that like is super apart, apparent as far as, uh, you know, yeah, Arshamish Goblin could also roll.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 2]
Arshamish Goblin, you can merge the two of these together. The two of these statues, they fit together.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, well obviously I'm gonna do that. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And just write down that, add like a statue to your inventory, a rat statue, and just write down like how many have been merged into it.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Arasham. Arasham.

[Speaker 2]
Arasham.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I got a, I got a 22.

[Speaker 15]
Easy. Rad. Easy.

[Speaker 2]
Rad. A box of what? Stalts?

Stalts.

[Speaker 3]
Like salt, like you put on food?

[Speaker 2]
Like salt, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Salt, like road salt, table salt? Salt.

[Speaker 2]
That are attached to the mechanism of the piano.

[Speaker 1]
Huh.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, it's still attached.

[Speaker 12]
Uh, can I, okay.

[Speaker 2]
When you do that, if you, uh, playing the piano actually rotates something on the box itself as a little wind-up mechanism.

[Speaker 1]
Can I roll a performance check to try to play the piano and figure out what that does? Okay. How do I roll a performance?

There we go. Uh, that is a 2.

[Speaker 3]
How did you roll a singing check? How does that happen?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, oh, I just rolled performance. I...

[Speaker 2]
No cigar.

[Speaker 1]
No cigar, okay. Um, does anything else about the piano look valuable?

[Speaker 15]
Nah.

[Speaker 1]
Like, are the keys ivory?

[Speaker 16]
Okay. That's fair.

[Speaker 10]
Alright, I guess we move on to the next room?

[Speaker 1]
Are we going up or are we going sideways?

[Speaker 10]
Going up.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Aimed yet?

[Speaker 1]
Bernice-a-farn.

[Speaker 3]
I wish I could turn his, uh, I wish I could rotate him. What?

[Speaker 1]
Do you want to go first, uh, Ms. Arsonist Goblin, or do you want me to go first?

[Speaker 3]
Arsonist Goblin will just walk right through.

[Speaker 1]
I will under, I will mutter under, he will mutter under his breath. Spoiled brat.

[Speaker 3]
Door, opening the door. Going in said door.

[Speaker 1]
I will stand outside the door to make sure that if, uh, she gets ambushed, I am not spotted. If that is fine with you, Mr. DM.

[Speaker 3]
Sure, sure, that's fine. I'm gonna open the door. Oh, well, I will, not the rat.

[Speaker 1]
Not the rat.

[Speaker 3]
You know what, rat? You go out here with them.

[Speaker 1]
Just in case.

[Speaker 3]
Just in case. Yeah. Uh-oh.

Oh, no, it's locked.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it is? Oh, that, ah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
That door's locked.

[Speaker 1]
Why was my first thought, I pick up the goblin and throw it? Um, I'm not gonna do that. I could also, um, burn the door.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I don't know. He's rolling.

[Speaker 3]
He does that. I'm gonna...

[Speaker 2]
You do that. If you wanna try to burn down the door, go ahead and make me a... Uh, it's gonna be, like, force open, but with, uh, you're over one, so...

[Speaker 1]
I will be back in, like, one second. I just gotta go take off my shirt. I'm still here, but, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Um, well, that failed.

[Speaker 15]
Okay, I'm back.

[Speaker 1]
Um... Do I hear, uh, Mrs. Arsonist Goblin? Or does, uh, Castro hear Mrs. Arsonist Goblin failing to open the door?

[Speaker 3]
Probably, considering you're, like, right there.

[Speaker 2]
In fact, there are more rats. Rats. Rats.

Where are the rats?

[Speaker 3]
By the way, nobody actually knows what gender Arsonist Goblin is. Well...

[Speaker 1]
What clothes are you wearing?

[Speaker 2]
A robe. Body type A or body type B?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, C. Well, since you're wearing... Well, since you're wearing a robe, I will immediately assume your gender is female.

Because wizards can't be men.

[Speaker 2]
What you need to do is just, like... When you take my approach, it's just like, alright, everybody gets a woman.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, everybody's a woman until proven otherwise. I like this.

[Speaker 3]
I like this.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, go ahead and add yourselves to an issue. Uh-oh.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
How do I do this again?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, double-click your character. Open up your character sheet.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
And select the, um... You'll see on the left side, beside the big word Perception, there's a dice. It should say Initiative, under Initiative.

There you go. 23! Alright, Charis.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, there's music? I didn't notice that.

[Speaker 3]
I was about to say, too, but I don't have Fireball, but I technically kind of do have Fireball.

[Speaker 1]
Is there any way to turn down the music on Foundry a little bit?

[Speaker 3]
Do you see the music icon?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, on your own side. What?

[Speaker 3]
The music icon. Up at the top. Right side.

And then there's sliders.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you. It was kind of distracting. Alright.

There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Bam! There are a lot behind this door.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you weren't kidding.

[Speaker 2]
Charis.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. I need to move my dog, so that will be one action.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to have him with you at the start of the encounter?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I don't like that. Yeah, let me just move this. That'll be like marching order.

Uh-oh.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm going to move him back. Don't touch him. Okay.

And then I can't... How... Let me look at his movement speed.

How is his movement speed, actually? 30. There we go.

Because I think the rats are coming from here.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
This area? Okay, cool. Nobody get in front of me.

[Speaker 1]
No, don't worry. I'm not going to.

[Speaker 3]
And then Charis will just remain where she is. I don't really have anything else to do. Oh, I do, actually.

Ignore that. I have Courageous Anthem.

[Speaker 13]
What's that do?

[Speaker 3]
Or if I have it... I'm not putting down the thingy, but you should have it. So Courageous Anthem, you gain a plus one bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear effects?

It's just a nice little thing. Oh. But yeah, that's all I'm going to do.

I cannot end my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it says right at the top. That's cool.

[Speaker 5]
Where did that go? Ah.

[Speaker 15]
Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 10]
Alright, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Rat time. Where is it?

Oh, it shouldn't be private GM roll anymore. Oh, that's going to fail.

[Speaker 8]
Also going to fail. Fidel Castro.

[Speaker 3]
I regret giving you that name. You there?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. My mic was off. So I moved up.

Do I see any rats from this doorway?

[Speaker 3]
Do you?

[Speaker 8]
I stepped in.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I thought they... If you can't see them, then that's a no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I thought they broke down the door.

[Speaker 2]
No, they're trying.

[Speaker 3]
Don't get in front of us in this goblin.

[Speaker 16]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to mosey back down here.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah, that's it.

[Speaker 12]
I can't do much yet. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, there we go. And that's it. Now come to other rats.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, they're blue. Fancy.

[Speaker 2]
The blue ones are the icy rats.

[Speaker 14]
Ouch. Bye, Fido.

[Speaker 3]
That was quick. He just kind of pops out of existence. See you next week, buddy.

[Speaker 2]
We have another rat. I also need you to make a workbook save. You know what?

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to hero point that. I'm going to hero point it. Hold on.

Do I have a hero point? Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
I see... This isn't a spell card. It can't be.

[Speaker 3]
See, this is the game that Arsonist Goblin is going to die in. The tutorial game.

[Speaker 1]
Man, for a somewhat mid-range, close-range fighter that is Castro, I nearly got taken down to one health.

[Speaker 3]
I nearly got killed that first hit. You're supposed to be a gun person, not a frontline person.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair. You got a point there.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just... Oh, what's going on there? Oh, well.

That is... It's time we have another icy rat. I need Castro.

Yeah, that's why that's fucking up. Okay, now I get it. What about Castro?

No, Castarang. I'm sorry. It's being silly.

Oh, no. Arsonist Goblin!

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm going to back up, inhale, and then exhale. Really bigly.

[Speaker 2]
Now, you do know that these things explode. Your previous interaction with them.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, well...

[Speaker 10]
Let me place the cone. Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, so they'll take 9 damage if they do not pass the DC 18 reflex.

[Speaker 9]
Uh, let me hold on. Doop, doop, doop.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, so if I do that... Ah, there we go. No, only one of them succeeded.

Uh... Pretty funny. This is a very topical dungeon.

Oh, wait a second. Okay, well then... Where's, um...

Hey Castro, where did... I feel like I didn't apply your damage earlier. Did you go?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think he's... I... Are you talking about...

Yeah, I moved, but the door was still closed. So I couldn't shoot him.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, well what you could do is you could delay your turn in that case. Or like hold an action, things like that.

[Speaker 13]
Oh! Did you want to like take a shot?

[Speaker 2]
Pop a shot off or something? It's a tutorial dungeon, so I can... Do stuff like this here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'll shoot one of them. Uh... Whatever one was the first to leave the door...

This one.

[Speaker 7]
Shoot whoever you want.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Pick one. More specifically...

Uh... Pick the one that's near death. Yeah.

That one's fine.

[Speaker 11]
27?!

[Speaker 2]
Yo!

[Speaker 11]
That's a critical hit!

[Speaker 2]
That's critical. That's a real critical damage. It's like the little critical button.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 20?!

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Kills it.

[Speaker 1]
Fucked him up. Hell yeah. And then I will take the rat...

Uh... Oh, wait. Nevermind, it's not my turn.

It's... The rat's turn again. It's uh...

It's... Yeah, okay. Gucci.

That's all.

[Speaker 3]
So, select and turn in the encounter tracker on the left of the screen.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it wasn't my turn. It's not even set to its turn right now. Oh, it's not.

Yeah. Which is totally fine.

[Speaker 3]
My turn. Or not. Yeah.

It was my turn. Now it's rat's turn.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, this guy completely... He takes no damage. Crazy.

I was gonna see if it was gonna cause a trim reaction.

[Speaker 5]
Let me... That would be beautiful.

[Speaker 3]
Grab a drink.

[Speaker 2]
I'll write to Castro. I roll damage.

[Speaker 3]
Good name, man. What was that name that Nessie gave her character? It was like D something, started with an A?

[Speaker 2]
D something, but started with an A.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she put D in front of it just to fuck with you because it was an A name?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh...

[Speaker 3]
DeAndre or something?

[Speaker 2]
DeAndre or something?

[Speaker 1]
What is it with A names that you don't want?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, because everybody will then start with A. Immediately.

[Speaker 13]
Oh, that's fair.

[Speaker 2]
If you ban A names the entire alphabet, it suddenly becomes a valid option.

[Speaker 3]
Did that happen in one of your previous things?

[Speaker 2]
Every single one.

[Speaker 3]
And you were just like, you know what, we're never doing that again. I don't know. I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
The 5e campaign, we had over a hundred different people show up.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but how many of those were actually repeat players?

[Speaker 2]
Lots of people actually played the games there. The vast majority of them actually did make it to a session. Now, many of them did not make it to more than one or more than two.

It was only a few of them.

[Speaker 12]
Like me!

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it doesn't upset me. The average session length for a 5e session is like, or campaign length, at the point where you can't call it a campaign, is like six sessions. So I was like, eh.

I wasn't worried about that. I'm like, alright, if people want to come in, be cool, contribute for like three sessions, at the end of the day, that's fine.

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to get this character to level 20, or whatever the Pathfinder level is. Got a long way to go.

[Speaker 5]
Mister, I can't play until two weeks from now.

[Speaker 12]
It might take a year or two.

[Speaker 7]
Okay man, leave me alone.

[Speaker 8]
And then, for Ars- I'm unconscious.

[Speaker 2]
Arsenish Goblin goes unconscious. There it is!

[Speaker 8]
Yay!

[Speaker 7]
Roll healing. Eh, it's good enough.

[Speaker 3]
And then my last action will be to shoot a motherfucker.

[Speaker 10]
Hopefully.

[Speaker 3]
You know what, we're going to use a hero point. Wait, do we have a hero point? Or did I use that hero point earlier?

[Speaker 2]
You should have one. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Um, okay. Let's try that again. Please?

Why is it not letting me?

[Speaker 7]
I would just- yep, try again.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, just try again. Hey!

[Speaker 7]
And then I'll take my hero point off. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
All that work for nothing! Oh, he died, never mind! Alright, well.

Beautiful.

[Speaker 2]
Who's next to him? That's your go. Icy Rat takes no damage!

Immune to cold, okay.

[Speaker 6]
This one, on the other hand.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, no, not Icy Rat. Incorrect. He takes half.

[Speaker 15]
Okay!

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Ficastro, do be mindful that this guy here This guy will explode upon death.

[Speaker 12]
Oh, yeah, I'm backing the fuck up!

[Speaker 3]
Uh-huh! That's my first fucking action!

[Speaker 1]
I'll ask a question when it's my turn. I'll be nice. If I can.

[Speaker 2]
I have to do, like, a tumble through.

[Speaker 1]
Ugh. Damnit, 25. We're fucked.

Let's just, like, poo through you.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, is that a flanking position? That's a flanking position. Oh, I'm fucked!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it sure is!

[Speaker 1]
I'm fucked. I'm dead. I'm, I'm, uh, at one- I'm unconscious, I'm at one point.

[Speaker 3]
Nope, you're not unconscious, you're just at one hit point.

[Speaker 1]
Oh! Ficastro!

[Speaker 3]
I'm at- Yeah, get the fuck out of there! Go, like, somewhere else.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I have a question. Mm-hmm. Would it count as an action to grab ar- grab Arsonist Goblin?

Don't worry about me. As in, book my ass out of there? Or would that count as two?

Don't worry about me.

[Speaker 2]
You can't really drag people. But you can drag people. Very, very slowly.

You can't- Very limited actions let you, like, free them.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So. I'm, uh, f- Sorry, Arsonist Goblin, but, uh- Uhhh.

[Speaker 2]
You gotta go diagonal first, because you can't move through enemies unless you tumble through, then you, uh- Yeah, go- Five feet.

[Speaker 6]
There you go, that works. Bernie's pretty small.

[Speaker 1]
Bernie- Bernie let me through!

[Speaker 5]
He did, he did.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's not letting me. It's like I'm- I can't move. Oh, because you- I'm on his token.

Yeah, thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Great. Yeah, it's good, Bernie.

[Speaker 1]
Ten, so that's fifteen feet. I've split you, Bernie. Uh, that's twenty feet.

Uh, that's twenty-five feet. Uh. That's thirty-five feet.

There we go! Um. Wait, actually, before I went down the stairs, could I have shot?

[Speaker 2]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
You can't split movement and move, but you can- Oh.

[Speaker 3]
I will just- Yeah. Um, you could've moved, stopped, um, shot- Shot, and then- That would be two actions, and, uh, did you reload? Do you know?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, and I will reload before I end my turn. Well, once I get down to the basement. Or the, not the basement, the- Yeah, you can, like, reload.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Or you could shoot somebody else, who's, like, not next to you, and then you can- Um.

[Speaker 3]
You could've done the reload hit with your melee on this guy, because he wouldn't have died immediately, and you probably would've hit him anyway. Um.

[Speaker 1]
The regular- Well, hindsight- Hindsight's 90-80, okay?

[Speaker 2]
I'm saying, like, you can't- because you didn't use all three of your actions, so I'm, like, saying, do you want to do that before you- Yeah, I'll do the reloading hit on, uh, this fucker. What?

[Speaker 1]
This fucker? Yeah, this fucker. Yeah.

Well, no, I gotta get good at this, otherwise I'm gonna forget, and when the actual game starts, and I don't wanna do it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, well, this is a tutorial game, so- Uh, how do I roll, how do I roll- Strike, do I just roll a melee hit?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, that's a- whenever they reference strike, that's, like, maybe- Okay.

[Speaker 5]
A 20! Alright, regular damage.

[Speaker 3]
Um. Seven! Uh, criticals work different in this game.

[Speaker 13]
It was on the fucker near the door, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Did you have the blue guy- uh, dead blue guy highlighted?

[Speaker 13]
No, it was supposed to be this guy. No, it's fine.

[Speaker 15]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And he's not feeling great.

[Speaker 9]
Die.

[Speaker 2]
Is that the end of your turn? Yes. Find rat.

Up. Over. And hey, there's another rat!

[Speaker 5]
Oh no, Bernie!

[Speaker 2]
To be prioritized. Arson-ish?

[Speaker 6]
Arson-ish. Uh, one action to give Bernie two actions.

[Speaker 9]
He's gonna... fight.

[Speaker 14]
Ho ho ho!

[Speaker 15]
Shit.

[Speaker 5]
And then book it.

[Speaker 3]
We are not getting eaten.

[Speaker 2]
Are you sure you don't want to hit the other guy?

[Speaker 3]
I'm positive, because I don't want to get caught in the shrapnel.

[Speaker 2]
Nah. I would've gone around with that guy, I don't- Yeah, that's- yeah, no, that's fine, you get- you get it right. I get it.

Fine.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just gonna have to die. Alright, cool.

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean? I can't let you move?

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, I just- I can't move, because if I move, um, then I don't have action- enough action for a spell, so I'm just gonna die. I have a potion, uh, if anybody wants to force-feed it to me after the round is over.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, alright. Yeah, you get turtling.

[Speaker 3]
Oh wait, I've gone down- I've gone down once before, that means- Okay. Hmm. Block it!

I got enough gold to resurrect.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's the attitude. Alright, who's getting hit?

[Speaker 14]
I can't, wait.

[Speaker 6]
There's not enough- I would have to move. That sucks.

[Speaker 9]
Alright, well, I guess I won't do that spell.

[Speaker 2]
Margaret, uh, what's going on?

[Speaker 10]
Oh, it's this one that I need to do.

[Speaker 2]
Are you still there?

[Speaker 3]
Am I- am I muted?

[Speaker 2]
No, no, I can hear you, you're just, like, fading away. Oh, sorry, my mic was- Was it not letting you do the, uh, breathe fire thing?

[Speaker 3]
No, it was, but I would have had to move backwards to get anybody.

[Speaker 2]
No, you could have hit these two guys.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, oop. That's fine. I can- I can just hit this guy.

[Speaker 8]
Alright. That will kill him.

[Speaker 5]
And also me. And maybe Charis. Alright, Arsonist, come on.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, okay, we're good. For now.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, we're dead, actually.

[Speaker 2]
I was at the end of your turn.

[Speaker 10]
Don't believe anything else. Except for die.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, do you want to grab the- Do you want to grab the rat, or do you want to force him to fall and land prone?

[Speaker 5]
Uh... Prone. I don't see any advantage to grabbing him.

[Speaker 2]
So he will fall prone.

[Speaker 5]
He will hug.

[Speaker 2]
He will use another action to stand back up. And then he will attack.

[Speaker 9]
Now I die.

[Speaker 10]
Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 2]
There you go, unconscious.

[Speaker 5]
Fine. I'm not getting back up until after the fight's over, though. That way I don't have a chance of going down again.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, you are dying three. Because you were knocked by a critical hit.

[Speaker 8]
Which is crazy. And then it's gonna start dragging you back.

[Speaker 5]
Hi, Bella. You need help?

[Speaker 6]
On this one? DERP! Um...

This is not a great, uh... Actually... No, this is fine.

Everything's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Just gonna use my last fucking thing on... Healing. Alright.

[Speaker 6]
Uh...

[Speaker 5]
I will reload and that will be my action.

[Speaker 13]
Okay. Okay. Uh...

I will move... Oh, I collected it with the wall.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I will move... Up here. Uh, can I see...

[Speaker 5]
Oh, please not that one. Please not that one.

[Speaker 1]
Can I see this one?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot it.

Uh, that's a 27, a critical hit. Uh... That's an 18.

[Speaker 8]
Even though you made it to dying three, you just go up to one and do two.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that definitely... Yeah, that fucking kills him. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And then I'm gonna spend... My last action...

To reload.

[Speaker 2]
Critical hits can... Uh... What's it called?

Critical hits in Pathfinder 2nd Edition can also be like... Just natural 20s, but also anything that's like 10 over the target number is also a critical hit. So your first attack...

If you always make that like whatever your highest bonus is, then that's... Increases your chance of doing something like that.

[Speaker 1]
So what you're saying is I need to get my shooting to plus 10.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if your shooting is your best attack, so if you always make that the first one, that's your best chance of getting a critical hit.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Good information. Good information.

And that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, we're injured. We're gonna back up.

[Speaker 2]
You gotta stand up first to clear the prone condition.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's... That's two, uh... That's two.

[Speaker 6]
My last action... Is there anything I can do? Yes, there is.

But I can't do that because that's pointless.

[Speaker 14]
What can I do?

[Speaker 6]
Actually, I'm gonna go back here and... We're gonna go here.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. That's... Yeah, I'm ending my turn.

We're not doing anything else.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's fine. Why is she wrecked?

[Speaker 6]
Girlie, are you okay? Do you need help? Let me move this table.

Her back legs don't work very well. Aww. There you go, girl.

Now you can get up and down. Without... Do you need help?

[Speaker 2]
I missed both of those. Fuck me. Charis!

[Speaker 6]
Let me help the dog really quickly. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Here you go, Girlie. Charis? Oh, goddammit.

Why did he have to come up to...

[Speaker 5]
You're gonna TPKS purely because we have one brain cell between the two of us. Okay. See what I can do.

[Speaker 15]
There you go.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I applied it. Okay, Castro, what I would suggest is you get the hell away and I will do the same.

[Speaker 5]
Now shoot him. Actually, yeah. You know what?

Just... go for it. Oh, I'm so sorry, Bernie.

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Oh, that's not... Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Are you muted or are you just quiet? Oh, shit. Yeah, that's...

Yeah, shoot the fuck out of it.

[Speaker 2]
That's a hit.

[Speaker 1]
Interned. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Is that all you do? Yeah, it was. Oh, and then I reload.

I don't understand.

[Speaker 3]
Interned? Okay, Arsene's Goblin is gonna spend... Yeah, it's gonna spend...

one action commanding Bernie I don't know how many hit points this guy has so I'm not gonna risk it.

[Speaker 6]
Bernie's gonna come back here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, remember you can always hit first and then have him move.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, but I'm worried that he has more hit points or he has less hit points than I'll hit for.

[Speaker 5]
Probably not, but I don't want Bernie getting blown up with a ice grenade.

[Speaker 2]
He is weak to fire. You have detected that previously. Bernie...

The nice thing is Bernie is only weak one so he takes one extra damage from my cold water.

[Speaker 1]
I have a question. Does this does this system automatically factor in my heritage of Arctic Elf? I think so, yeah.

Okay. That's what I wanted to make sure.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like for instance you have resistance called one so you take one less damage. Oh. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
Hell yeah. I'm glad I got Bernie out of there. Oh my god.

Can we go to town and buy some potions and then finish this?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
Holy shit.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Cool. Can I loot the fuck out of the corpses before we do that?

[Speaker 2]
You find 218 silver and one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I didn't roll anything.

[Speaker 3]
He did.

[Speaker 1]
I did.

[Speaker 3]
And usually we don't really have to roll much for looting. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
If it's like secret shit then there's like rolling is always good if you want to find like secret shit. Oh, that's still attached to my head. Bring that over there.

[Speaker 11]
What's settlement level? Sorry?

[Speaker 3]
What level is the settlement?

[Speaker 8]
Seven.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Did I get any more rat pelts or anything?

[Speaker 2]
There are more statues within these rats. Eight of them total.

[Speaker 7]
All right, I'll add that.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was going to say I think Picastro is a is a superstitious man and he's not going to touch that.

[Speaker 2]
And there is a loot and a particularly sharpened one of the femur bone is particularly sharp and seems to be artificial.

[Speaker 7]
I will grab that.

[Speaker 1]
They have better health care. I will grab that if if the gabloon does not want it. Mr. Gabloon wants to add them to the party sheet?

Yeah. Astro Frogger could you please do that because I am illiterate.

[Speaker 14]
What am I adding?

[Speaker 1]
A sharpened femur and eight statues.

[Speaker 3]
I'll put the eight statues in my inventory because I have rat statues already in my inventory. Of course I can just add it to the party stash as well.

[Speaker 2]
There's also eight there's also then there's the sharpened thing and then there's a flute. So I'm going to add both of those.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I got the rat statues.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So one two three four five six seven eight. So that equals out to ten.

[Speaker 15]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
So far. So would it be an hour would it take an hour? Actually it doesn't matter if it takes an hour because it's a different one.

I'm going to pay for somebody to I don't trust my own skills so I'm going to pay for somebody to treat my wounds. How much is that?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to do the same.

[Speaker 2]
Skilled hireling I think I'm going to be like five silver for each of you at least.

[Speaker 1]
I will do that. So minus five silver. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Also pretty sure Charis leveled up there. Oh, I have to end the account.

[Speaker 3]
Charis did level up. Oh shit. Where did that happen at?

When did that happen?

[Speaker 2]
It's actually at the end of the previous encounters. You were three away from leveling up.

[Speaker 3]
I did not even notice that's infuriating infuriating. Holy shit. Okay.

There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Was I supposed to get XP from that fight because I didn't no no only only for Agatha.

[Speaker 2]
I'm very discriminatory. I'm I discriminate against women in my personal life. So when I'm gaming I'm favorable to them.

And then I there we go.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. I got it. I got it.

Yeah. I would did the flute look uh you haven't identified it yet. Let me add it to the stash.

[Speaker 3]
What? I'm gonna get it. You can't touch it.

I have a bard. Yeah but how much was the what did the flute look like? He hasn't added it to the party stash.

Um so we'll get to that. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Because maybe I can hawk it. Maybe we can hawk it to a uh what's it called uh not a hawk to a vendor um a merchant. Where a hawk to a vendor would just be a fucking hooker.

That's true.

[Speaker 14]

What's the wode? If you journey into the wilderness at any point there's a good chance that he'll try to especially if it's near a crossing you have a chance he's gonna pop out there at some point.

[Speaker 3]
Then it'll be a Scooby-Doo skedaddle away from there?

[Speaker 2]
Exactly it'll be a chase uh a chase scene.

Port City does a lot of trade they're kind of like the access point to the rest of the Maid once you get past the Loch Bonner house which is a really big lake really it's an inland sea it's roughly the size of the Mediterranean or all the Great Lakes.

The Mac in the middle is the Maid.

[Speaker 3]
The Maid is the The Maid is the continent.

The Maid is the continent. The Maid is the continent. C ontinent.

The Maid was the The Maid was the They were really The Maid were So the answer to this is The Maid is The Maid is the like my measurements. What are you trying to get? I'm just trying to get my measurements so I can go to the next armorer when I get money and have my measurements.

[Speaker 10]
Why do you need measurements?

[Speaker 1]
This is purely, this is purely roleplay.

[Speaker 10]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I just feel like you can just get your self sized stuff just like 10 silver.

[Speaker 1]
10 silver. I can do that.

[Speaker 9]
Minus 10 silver.

[Speaker 10]
You gain fast healing. What is fast healing? What does fast healing do?

Glorious healing amends wounds and provides temporary respite.

[Speaker 2]
Fast healing is like, I think it's healing usually at the start of your turn. It'll it'll explain how often it happens but I think it's usually at the start of your turn. Fast healing.

[Speaker 1]
How do I restore all my max HPs? Okay. There we go.

15. There we go.

[Speaker 2]
A creature with fast healing or regeneration regains the listed amount of hit points each round at the beginning of its turn.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Would I get rid of wounded too by getting treat wounds?

[Speaker 10]
The condition ends if someone successfully restores hit points to use in treatment.

[Speaker 14]
There we go. Yeah. And I would get full HP?

[Speaker 2]
Treat wounds doesn't necessarily heal you to full.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, well I'll just use potions now.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, try, have somebody um, have somebody apply it to you or try treat wounds in yourself. Something.

[Speaker 6]
Eight.

[Speaker 2]
Treat.

[Speaker 6]
Goblin. Good luck.

[Speaker 1]
Is this kind of a red light district?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we trained. So it's um, success would be 2d8 healing. So I think it would be success.

So go ahead and roll 2d8.

[Speaker 10]
2d8. Okay.

[Speaker 14]
2d8. Oh great. Jeez.

I rolled terribly.

[Speaker 10]
But it is what it is. Uh, then I'll just use potion.

[Speaker 15]
Oh wow. Better on that one.

[Speaker 14]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Are we ready to continue? What? Are we ready to continue?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, well I didn't get my answer up because this city of a red light district, but yeah, I'm ready.

[Speaker 3]
No, it is not Scooter.

[Speaker 1]
I don't want to go there. I just want to know. Yeah, it doesn't have a full red light district.

I just wanted to like, suss out like the local, uh, what's the word?

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't have like a district dedicated to it. It's like, there's, there's going to be brothels and stuff.

[Speaker 1]
I was trying to suss out the local, um, healing on that. Like, are they okay with it? Are they, um.

You'll have more luck with that in the Fey, uh, Feywild, in the Woad. I don't want to go there. I'm trying to figure out the, like, are they pyridines?

Are they normal people? Yeah. I can't explain it.

I'm not good at words. I'm trying to suss out the sitch, but yeah, I'm ready to go.

[Speaker 14]
Uh, I guess we go through this door?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, what door? I'm still on the map.

[Speaker 3]
Oh wait, we haven't looked through this door. I'm still on the, I'm still on the. All right, so up at the very top.

[Speaker 2]
We're just gonna try to identify the other thing, by the way.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, oh yes. Oh, I completely forgot. Thank you for reminding me.

Priorities Unusual object. Can we pay somebody to? In the city?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's totally fine. Uh, 50, uh, identifying. Five gold.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Five gold? All right, I got it.

[Speaker 1]
I hope so, because I'm poor as shit. I don't, I have one gold.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I, it's a, it's a thing for me, because it's a, a flute, but.

[Speaker 7]
All right, um, message the, my mother.

[Speaker 14]
Oh, ew. Okay. These pan pipes are made of, oh.

[Speaker 2]
I want to figure out how to, how to drag other spells into this, and I will figure it out.

[Speaker 9]
You gain a plus one.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, all right. Gocaris. Great.

Let me resize it, so it doesn't bury me. The flute's called a little love? No, that's the knife.

[Speaker 1]
That was a knife? Or was that the sharp-ass femur?

[Speaker 2]
That's a sharp-ass femur.

[Speaker 1]
I would have just called it sharp-ass femur, but.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I can drag a spell directly in there. Okay, so talk to.

[Speaker 3]
Imagining us bringing it in, asking what it is, and they're like, oh yeah, that's the, that's the rat pipes of compulsion you got there.

[Speaker 2]
There you go. I'm gonna add speak with animals, but only works with rats.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I love that.

[Speaker 1]
I swear too much.

[Speaker 3]
So do I, so do I. My poor mother.

[Speaker 2]
All right, I'm gonna get ready to, I'm gonna get ready to head out. Uh, I got about like an hour and a half before work. I probably want to get some meal hungry.

[Speaker 7]
All righty.

[Speaker 1]
If you want, we can stop here and pick up, like, later this week, like Wednesday. Or Tuesday. Oh, so you can play later this week.

I can play a short, mid-sized game this week.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, listen, that sounds totally fine to me.

[Speaker 1]
Because I'm tired of shit. You need to go to work.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, okay. If that's fine with everybody, then let's do that. There's a coat pistol in the weapons, in the, in the party stash.

Are you putting spells on that or is that just a normal coat pistol?

[Speaker 2]
I put a coat pistol in there.

[Speaker 3]
Or did Scooter put it in there? Did I put it in there? I don't see anything.

I don't see a coat pistol. I just see a little love. I'm on the wrong thing.

The party stash was behind my fucking character thing. My bad.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like, if there's a coat pistol, I'm stealing that shit. So, little love, what is that? It's a plus two dagger.

Or a plus one dagger.

[Speaker 3]
You want me to drag that onto your character sheet?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, if you don't mind.

[Speaker 3]
With the dagger.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you don't mind, I can use it. Or sell it.

[Speaker 3]
If you're gonna sell it, I will stab you.

[Speaker 1]
Well, what is it, what is it? You'll have to walk me through what it does. Eventually.

Like, uh, tomorrow or whatever.

[Speaker 3]
Little love.

[Speaker 1]
The steel dagger.

[Speaker 3]
The steel plus one dagger is chipped and worn but no less deadly for it is much, for its much used appearance. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the little love, with little love, you can activate the dagger to spring away from your foes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh! Fancy! I'll take that, hell yeah.

So does it still look like a sharp-ass femur or does it look like a knife?

[Speaker 3]
I'm assuming it looks like a sharp-ass femur. And you can also just rename it to sharp-ass femur if you want to.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it looks like a- How? It's a sharp, it's a sharp femur, it's, it's a knife that's made of a rat bone.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna get a sheath commission called, uh, a sheath for it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna add the same, same thing that, uh, that I just added to the rat, which is each time you increase your wounded or dying conditions, a hostile rat equal or lower level appears next to you.

[Speaker 3]
A what?

[Speaker 2]
A hostile rat.

[Speaker 3]
How does that help in the slightest?

[Speaker 2]
It doesn't, it does the opposite of help.

[Speaker 1]
I gotta get rid of the thing. For the flute or the, uh, the, the, the little love?

[Speaker 3]
Probably both. This is gonna cause some issues, but you know, I got 42 health points.

[Speaker 1]
I become the rat king. No rat is my enemy.

[Speaker 2]
There's another thing I want to put in there about, I'll save it for, for next game. Because I love these little games where we just like spend a couple of minutes. You know, just, just a couple hours.

Like go ahead and kill some stuff, get some stuff done. It feels great because I'm like, oh fuck, I know, I know what I want to do for the next one. It's like the perfect way.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And I'm probably, these are probably mainly what I'm gonna have to do.

[Speaker 2]
If any of us can figure out, if any of us can figure out like a good way of wording this, let me know. But what I would like to happen is when you kill people with these items, I would like a, one of those little rat statues to appear.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, so there's like 10 of them?

[Speaker 2]
Right now, you guys have 10 of them.

[Speaker 3]
What do the rat statues do?

[Speaker 1]
Nothing at the moment. We're going to summon a god.

[Speaker 3]
The last thing that Arsonist Goblin needs is to summon a god. Is to find a religion.

[Speaker 1]
But maybe you could become Rat God. You could become Rat Jesus, Arsonist Goblin. Why don't you want to be Rat Jesus?

[Speaker 2]
There is a Rat God in Cemed that was battered. Was immortal, became Rat God.

[Speaker 3]
If I become Rat God, you all are going to be in some trouble. I think I will just give Arsonist Goblin over to James and become a BBEG. Oh yeah, Rat God.

[Speaker 1]
But let's just say I won't become Rat God.

[Speaker 3]
You might. You know what? I kind of want that for one of my characters whenever I have to like leave for Job Corps.

Um, I might have one of my characters become a bad guy and just give him to you.

[Speaker 1]
Or, or, or. You could give them to me and they could become an even worse guy. I'm kidding.

I am trying to be a better player. I think he does a great job. What is the conversion rate on, uh, uh, silver to gold?

[Speaker 2]
Same as D&D where it's like 10.

[Speaker 1]
So we have 20.

[Speaker 3]
If you want all the silver, you can have all the silver. I have. Well no, because we're not splitting.

I have so much. I have so much money. I have like.

Yeah, but how does, how does Arsonist Goblin. Arsonist Goblin doesn't really give a shit about money.

[Speaker 1]
Arsonist Goblin doesn't know what money is.

[Speaker 3]
Arsonist Goblin does not give a fuck about money. Arsonist Goblin loves fire. Um, and Arsonist Goblin just got what they wanted.

All right. They just got a flamethrower, which if you look in their, uh, in their, um, in their notes, it says alchemist flamethrower near Mimosa. Go get.

And that's what they've gotten. So they're, uh, they're happy.

[Speaker 15]
Oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if there's a, you know, those, uh, this is going to sound really weird, but do you know, uh, during World War II, the, uh, SS had those belt buckle guns. What? They had belt buckle guns.

I got to Google this. They were very rare, but some of them had, the higher officers had belt buckle guns and they would shoot like these. Wow.

Like these 22 rounds. In case they got captured or some shit. And I was wondering if I could commission, I was wondering eventually if I could commission a craftsman and one of the major cities to make me a magical one of those.

[Speaker 3]
These guys were pieces of shit, but they had like really good style. That's sucks.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. They really did. Fuck you.

It's funny. The mouse tank wasn't a fucking, if the mouse tank would have worked, we would have, we would have been speaking German.

[Speaker 3]
I wish that, um, I wish that fascism today had good style, but no, it's just fucking stuff from Xi'an, you know?

[Speaker 2]
No, it doesn't. It's not the same thing. It doesn't work.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Hi Bella.

[Speaker 1]
You need to go boss to go fascist again. Hey, I'm going to go.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for playing. It was chill.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you for playing. You know, it was just me and him, but it's a tutorial game and I thank you so much.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, which day would work better for you guys? Tuesday or Wednesday?

[Speaker 2]
Wednesday, I think would work best for me.

[Speaker 10]
Okay, we can do Wednesday. Oh, what time do we want a Wednesday?

[Speaker 13]
Uh, it's up to James.

[Speaker 3]
It is central time. What time zone are you in James?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. What are you available? So I will probably be up.

I will probably wake up like, um, on Wednesday. I'll probably wake up like an hour or two after, after right now. To think like 4.30, 5.30 CST or that would be 5 or 6.30, uh, Friday at this time.

[Speaker 3]
You want to make a event and we can adjust from there?

[Speaker 15]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I could probably do 5.30, 6.30. I don't really care. As long as you don't got work you ought to go to and I don't got work that day.

[Speaker 2]
It'll be Wednesday the 17th. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Hopefully my fucking trench coat gets in by then. I'm going to have to pay so many import fees on that. Oh, uh, peace.

[Speaker 15]
See ya.

[Speaker 11]
Bye. Uh.

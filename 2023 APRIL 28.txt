[Speaker 2]
So, like, it must have counted. Three hounds. Yeah.

We have three more. So, I'll have... This one, you take one, I'll take the other.

And I'll send, uh... My wolf companion to do the third. And so...

[Speaker 4]
Surely I can't mess with the net twice in a row.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you'll be surprised.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, well, you guys are stealthed. What's the, uh... Somebody give me...

Somebody act as caller. Somebody tell me what's going on.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, um... I'm gonna try to target this one. I assume Maya's gonna target that one, and if no one else is going after that one, I'll send my wolf to try to tackle it.

[Speaker 4]
I'll roll a net attack. I assume they're surprised by this, so it's just a flat roll.

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm. Twenty-four. Nice!

[Speaker 2]
Twenty-two.

[Speaker 6]
Nice!

[Speaker 2]
And, uh... Tackle, and would that be with advantage for the wolf, or...

[Speaker 1]
What's the ability to... They're surprised? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
I think grapple gets advantage, though.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's just attack rolls. Right, because it's not... Oh, it's gonna shim on me.

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 1]
It's not likely to... Yeah, there we go. Yeah, well, there you go.

[Speaker 2]
Well, we got two of them, so... Hopefully we can, uh... Restrain the last one before it gets a chance to do the net.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. That's where you add these guys. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

Alright, so the wolf companion didn't make it. We have the attack roll with the net, which succeeds. I believe these two are...

Restrained, yeah. Sorry, have they been what? What?

[Speaker 4]
Maia and Robin threw nets at these two.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. Why can't I see... Maia got a 24 to hit.

Oh, Maia hit that. Okay. So it's literally just...

Just the one that the wolf tried to go after. Literally just the one. Okay, what have you guys got for this wolf?

Everybody go at once.

[Speaker 5]
I'm finding... Continue.

[Speaker 6]
I'll have my... familiar attack. Nope.

[Speaker 1]
The lawyer has advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
So, one damage.

[Speaker 1]
Damn. Alright, somebody else?

[Speaker 5]
I would like to command it to grovel.

[Speaker 1]
That's a wisdom save? Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Versus... Yeah, just make it heavy.

[Speaker 3]
I am going to walk up to it, squeak, and then walk back.

[Speaker 5]
And I also would like to... I'll be finding.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we got Maia and Robin have actions left.

[Speaker 4]
We have advantage now because of the squeak. I can't move out of the tree I'm in, I think. Oh no, I can.

I will use my second net.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Is that an advantage to roll?

[Speaker 1]
It's... No, they did it properly. Alright, Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll first try the net, and then if that fails, then I'll try the wolf again.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. I'm going to roll his athletics in advance.

[Speaker 8]
Oh wow. Good news.

[Speaker 1]
There we go.

[Speaker 8]
Huzzah. Nicely done. Yep.

Alright, so that wolf is taken care of.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are good. What do you do with these guys?

[Speaker 2]
Same as the last one, I assume. Turn them up, take the colours off.

[Speaker 4]
And reclaim the nets.

[Speaker 8]
And reclaim the nets, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I will mark off three more chains.

[Speaker 6]
Alright. And I will snag three more colours if nobody minds.

[Speaker 8]
Not at all. Alright, those are clear. Is it?

Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we've got to roll stats again, I assume.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, probably.

[Speaker 4]
Also, that trace is still up this time, so we're good.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. 15 here.

[Speaker 4]
And I rolled above a 5.

[Speaker 8]
38. I don't think I rolled below a 30. Hmm.

One over here. Three over here. And corpses to the north.

Those are corpses. I'd say we quickly grab the hounds and head north. Yep, a lot more corpses up there.

[Speaker 3]
I think there were some more to the southwest as well.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, well technically we don't know that yet, because we haven't seen it.

[Speaker 8]
Yep. So two down there, one up there. So which way are we headed?

Left or north? Yep, somebody make a decision. Let's go north.

Yeah, a bunch of corpses. Oh, hound. Got one hound.

Not seeing anything else over here. Oh, two hounds.

[Speaker 6]
Can I investigate the corpses?

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. Everybody stop moving for just a second, because a bunch of people are moving in 5 foot increments again.

[Speaker 8]
Oh, that was crap.

[Speaker 3]
Can I do medicine for it?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. We're trying to determine how to guide and stuff. Corona, if you look at these creatures you can't really identify the clothing and stuff like that.

You can't get too many details on the clothing, but it kind of looks like these people were part of a merchant caravan, and maybe there were some pilgrims on it, but you're not sure if that's just like the robes have been damaged or if they're religious garb. Hera, when you look at these, you notice a few spots. Let's see here.

You wouldn't think to look through this at first until you notice that one of the corpses has this particular wound through their eye where it's just like a needle-like hole that appears to have one subject appears to have just passed through the eye, and through several others you notice that the hole is like went in one of their arms through the ribcage and out another arm. Another looks to have gotten it from the base of the back and then out through the top of the chest as if they were shot while they were fallen, and it looks like these people were killed with an incredibly thin projectile, probably thinner than an arrow, or almost certainly thinner than an arrow, and considerably sharper.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm. I don't think the hounds did this.

[Speaker 3]
That's probably the warning we got from the Fae.

[Speaker 2]
You know what the warning was?

[Speaker 3]
Um, to keep a careful guard around Banassus. Um, the ruin without sight. I would guess maybe that these people turned away from him, and this is the result of that.

[Speaker 8]
Oh. Lovely.

[Speaker 4]
Do I recognize these people at all? They aren't the Drow that were helping us at the towers, were they?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, these are mostly uh, these are mostly Wood Elves. Damn. And then the one in ropes is a human.

[Speaker 8]
Hmm. I think we should move on. We should probably do something about these hounds first, though.

I am going to move my 25 feet. Oh, there's a wall. What's this wall here?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's wombo-combo again.

[Speaker 4]
Um, yeah, I'm happy to try that again. Climb into the tree.

[Speaker 8]
Tweedle-ah. Oh, we found a third one. Farther north.

James, am I able to shadow step between trees?

[Speaker 1]
Hence. Let's see here. Uh, I mean, if you're able to see them, I think yeah.

It's pretty much the only place that you can shadow step.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's why I was asking. I'll shadow step to this tree and go for this dog. If you guys want to go for the other one.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokes. I'll walk into position to tackle one.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that you saw my message, but I think you're good to join us now if you'd like.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I'll try to keep it active.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 8]
Alright.

[Speaker 7]
Is there an initiative call yet?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, not just yet. I think folks who are stealth are going to take these guys out first. So, Mike's going to start up the net.

Robin starts up the net. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
I'm also going to use one of my recovered nets.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. The last one here.

[Speaker 2]
I assume. I got rid of that one, so I assume you went to...

[Speaker 1]
well, it doesn't matter either way. And tackle. Yep, these guys are surprised.

Yeah, probably not likely. 17 hits.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it would have been a flat roll, not a...

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god, Hal just met it again.

[Speaker 6]
I'm safe, please.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. If you pop that little... oh, that's the wrong guy.

If you ever pop that little thing in chat that tells me to... it lets me just click a button real quick for the count save.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, they're fine.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we're going to do initiative again. Combat encounters ready. Looks like we got everybody up.

So, first things first, this guy's going to try to break out of his net. Got a disadvantage, but this book's over. Next hound is going to do the same.

Alright, nothing to worry about then. Maya!

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Maya's going to shadow step back to this tree and toss the net. Her second net is this one that's not netted, or is it...

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that one.

[Speaker 4]
The one to the left?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that one's not netted. Oh, well, there you go. Perfect.

Alright. Out of initiative again.

[Speaker 4]
I can chain them up again.

[Speaker 5]
I'll take three more chains out. And I'll take my net back.

[Speaker 2]
And remove the collars while we're in them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you know what? Sorry. Not out of initiative.

[Speaker 2]
No?

[Speaker 1]
No. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
It's a struggler.

[Speaker 6]
We've got some coming in from behind.

[Speaker 2]
Uh-oh. Oh, I have no more nets.

[Speaker 1]
I have one more.

[Speaker 5]
I have one.

[Speaker 4]
Is that a hack? Have I seen that before?

[Speaker 1]
I think Maya specifically has seen that hack too many times at this point. Goddammit.

[Speaker 6]
I think I also see the big guy.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, whoa. Oh, dear.

[Speaker 4]
I have nothing left on my turn, really, so I'm just going to move to there and end.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. Tel'Koi is going to teleport out of this tree here. Or reveal themselves out of this tree.

What would you like to do?

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to move and then cast Tasha's Heaviest Laughter on one of these creatures. Hoping they have some intelligence.

[Speaker 8]
This one?

[Speaker 7]
The one that's closest to the south.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Go ahead and make sure that you click on Tasha's Heaviest Laughter so it appears in the chat.

[Speaker 8]
Intelligence save in the meantime. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they have intelligence of seven, so you're good. And it is now grown. Alright, what else would you like to do with your turn?

[Speaker 7]
I am good. I'll hold here.

[Speaker 6]
I want to know what the dog's laughter is like.

[Speaker 1]
Hyena. It literally sounds like a hyena that somebody ran through a blender.

[Speaker 6]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Robin, it's up next.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it's Martin. Okay, okay. I'm going to...

How much movement do I have, let's see.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I can gain range. I'm going to try to throw on the undersky here. Hello?

Maybe?

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to work today? There we go. And attack roll...

Oh, what's that? There we go. Still got it, though.

[Speaker 1]
Nice!

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so... And now I see this hag. I assume we can kill the hag, I guess.

[Speaker 4]
Kill it.

[Speaker 2]
Kill it with fire. Okay, I'm going to send my companion to throttle it, and I'm going to shoot him in the face.

[Speaker 8]
19 hits. Okay. Throttle it.

And then... Command them to take a chunk out of her.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, and I still got a bit of movement, so I'm going to double back.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Tyrona, you are on deck. Alright.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to Eldritch Blast the hag. She's right in front of Para. Oh no, she's right in front of me.

Up.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you'd see her, actually.

[Speaker 6]
In the red hood?

[Speaker 2]
No, that's me.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Whoops, I didn't recognize you. The snow's getting in the way!

[Speaker 6]
Alright, in that case... I will... I'll Eldritch Blast the metal hound.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 6]
No advantage?

[Speaker 1]
I don't believe so, no.

[Speaker 6]
Nope, neither one hits.

[Speaker 1]
Unfortunate. Anything else to return?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I'll have my familiar attack.

[Speaker 1]
Then Majako, you are on deck.

[Speaker 5]
Majako, hearing there's a hag, is going to...

[Speaker 6]
Familiar is successful.

[Speaker 5]
Going to go up here. Can I attempt to prone this thing with a shield bash?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I don't... Is there any restrictions on doing so?

[Speaker 5]
It just says I can do the shove action as a bonus action when I attack twice.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 5]
So let's do a contested athletics. Now I'm going to attack with my longsword twice.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. My hit's going to give you an extra d6 of cold damage on top of that.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll take care of that once I get to the damage.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. A level 1 smite and a level 2 smite. Which is, I believe, 3d?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so the first one is going to be... A first level smite. Okay.

Plus 2 smites, so first and second low. I mean, one first, one second level smite, which is, how much is that? So the second smite is going to be, would normally be 3d8, but it's going to be 6d8 because you got a crit.

[Speaker 5]
Mhmm.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see.

[Speaker 5]
Roll 6d8.

[Speaker 4]
Forward slash roll. Forward slash R. Got it.

[Speaker 5]
Oof.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Now, it's normally the 2d... It's 2d8 for the first level on the first hit.

[Speaker 1]
It's already been, uh, been added. Did you roll 2d8 earlier?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I said one first, one second.

[Speaker 1]
2d8 was for the sword attack. Was for the sword attack, and then the... Oh, so you still have to roll...

[Speaker 4]
He has his first smite to do still. I gotcha.

[Speaker 5]
2d8.

[Speaker 1]
I know he rolled a Mal'Border.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this thing has one hit point left.

[Speaker 5]
It's living on a dream. And prone.

[Speaker 1]
This thing's going to attempt to get out of Para. You are on deck. It's how it gets out of its...

Alrighty, Para.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm looking. I think I am going to... Everybody's still in range for beacon.

I think I'm going to go for beacon.

[Speaker 4]
Good call.

[Speaker 3]
Good call. And then I am going to move back just a bit.

[Speaker 8]
And that's it.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Is it Subterrae Ice Troll, who is mislabeled? I did...

Ooh, by the way, I did figure out, finally, why my ability modifiers were not getting added in new stat blocks. What was happening? Because of an update in Foundry's 5th Edition system that I think happened around the time of the OGL.

It has to... A monster has to include at mod in order to include its thing. So whenever I make a new one, it has to include at mod.

Yeah, I did that for the ones I wrote up for you, so they should be fine. Perfect. Just give me a second.

[Speaker 6]
I love your background music.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sweet. Who's from Terraria? This one, believe it or not, is from Destiny 1, I think.

Really? Sounds a lot like Terraria music to me. Okay.

This is probably... I never played Destiny 1, but this is probably one of the best soundtracks that came out of it. This is pretty good.

Yes. Input radius? That's gotta be...

Oh, you guys are perfectly placed. Thank you so much! The only ones out of the wolf are me, Jacko.

Perfect. Alright, I need con saves for you folks. We all make it.

Nice. And I take half of whatever that is? So, it would be...

Oh, I rolled terribly, so it would be 9.

[Speaker 3]
What's the concentration con thing?

[Speaker 1]
Half damage or 10. Yeah, half damage or 10.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I mean for, like, concentration.

[Speaker 4]
It's a con save. Oh, oh.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I got the same number. I just don't know what the DC for it is.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I definitely failed it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the DC would be... DC would be 10. Because I rolled under...

What should we call it? Alright, so. You failed your save for the ability.

You took 9 damage, half on a success, so 4. And I have resistance, so 2. Alrighty.

And then, Para, you made... Yeah, you made both of your saves, so you're still maintaining concentration on the thing. This guy is going to attempt to get out of his castle.

4 damage.

[Speaker 7]
Do you want to say again? I'm sorry, did Telqua take 4 damage as well?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, if you succeeded your save. Which you did, by a lot. Alright, so this guy gets up here, gets out of his net.

He's going to run up. And he can't do anything else with his turn, because that was his action.

[Speaker 6]
No, bad dog.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, but the next one's up. I don't know what they're doing. And Letix?

Disadvantage, I still got a 21. Alright. This is the part of the session where I start rolling well.

Anishag is up, going to stand up.

[Speaker 5]
He'll probably not be too happy with me.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to cast pot cloud, so she can run away. Figures! That's not hound over here.

This one is...

[Speaker 5]
What is the wind speed around us? Currently?

[Speaker 1]
Probably about 10 miles an hour.

[Speaker 5]
You might want to read cloud because next turn this cloud's going to be gone.

[Speaker 3]
I think she only wanted to get away.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Probably.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no! Success! But, it is your turn.

[Speaker 4]
So, this troll is definitely not the Fae we're looking for.

[Speaker 1]
Which is funny. I think that you fought one of these things your first session in this campaign. We have not seen another one since.

[Speaker 4]
Does bring themselves from the gnats break the gnats?

[Speaker 1]
I believe so, yes.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's only if you actually damage them with an attack. I think. I'm not really sure what they say.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, dealing slashing damage destroys the gnat. Just breaking out doesn't mention destroying the gnat.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so the gnats are fine. I'm going to go collect a gnat and drop down from the tree. There's one like here.

Stuck in a wall. I'm going to move to like... Where's the wall I'm stuck on?

I want to move to here. Like, here.

[Speaker 1]
That's weird because it's not... I think I just got to do ethereal walls because I'm not doing the vision thing. I don't know whether I have to edit the...

I could just edit the terrain walls. Alright, they're clear now. You're good.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to go to here and toss the gnat at the center dog. I have disadvantage. 14 misses.

There is a gnat next to the dog. Bonus action dodge.

[Speaker 1]
End turn. Alrighty. Tel'koa, it is your turn.

[Speaker 7]
Yep. So, we're trying to not kill the dogs. Is that correct?

Yes.

[Speaker 2]
The hag and the troll on the other hand are free game.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to cast Eldritch Blast on the troll.

[Speaker 1]
Hits.

[Speaker 7]
And I think I get a second bolt.

[Speaker 1]
I don't want to play this. Alrighty, good hit. So, there's nothing to your turn.

[Speaker 7]
Sorry, yeah. That concludes my turn. I'm a tree hugger over here.

I like it.

[Speaker 1]
This guy is going to move right over here. I need you three to make me a DC 13 dexterity saving throw. Both of yous.

Me too? I guess. Could be a wider line.

Everybody makes it. So, instead of taking 15, you take half.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's 7, I think. And I take half of that, so 3? I'm a 3, I think, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's now your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's see. What can I do without murdering this thing? I suppose I can do non-lethal attacks, right?

With melee weapons. Use the blunt end of a short sword. Yeah, I'll whip out a couple of short swords and start trying to bludgeon this thing without killing it.

that's a fail, I assume.

[Speaker 1]
And, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not really yeah, I'm not really built for mana. So I'll swing around here to try to keep it from going after these things. And I will command my wolf to search for the hag and kill her, basically.

So it's going to move further into the fog. Incidentally, I can see everything with the hound. It doesn't seem to have a regular line of sight.

Don't know don't know where that is. how much movement do I have? Let's see, I was here, so 20, another 10.

Yeah, I'll move up out of the fog. And if it can't see anything, it will just, well, it can't necessarily hold its action, but, you know, react to this sort of thing. Ah, yeah, if the hound, I don't know.

Can it hold its action? I think it can. Yeah, I'll have it hold its action to attack the hag if it sees it.

[Speaker 1]
Hound of Banassas failed its saving throw against Tasha's hideous laughter, meaning that Corona is now on deck.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, um, Aldrich Blast, Warlock's Mainstay. One success.

[Speaker 1]
Both success, well, depending on who you're shooting.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, I was going for the, um, hound nearby.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this one here?

[Speaker 6]
No, this one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, okay, that's fine, yeah, one success. Very nice.

[Speaker 6]
Um, no, failure. Oh, success. Uh, so, roll that save throw.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, attributes, constitution, save. He fails!

[Speaker 6]
Alright, poisoned.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there we go. Alrighty. Is that the end of your turn?

Yep. That brings us to Mijako.

[Speaker 5]
Mijako is going to go um, you. Going to go to the troll, out of that circle, to the troll. Hello!

First, going to try and prone him with his shield mastery thing, and then if he fails, well, then he's just going to swing at him. Okay, he's prone, so I do this at advantage.

[Speaker 2]
Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, level two smite, and level one smite again. Try and get this guy down. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Six plus two, that's eight. Eight. Oh, there you go.

How's he looking? Oh, what did you roll? Did you roll the smite damage altogether?

Yeah. Uh, he's still up, but he's looking probably not happy.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, looking a bit slow there, I'd say. Is that your turn?

[Speaker 5]
That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
This guy's going to move around here, and Parai, you are up.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I forgot.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to move here, and then I'm going to squeak at that hound. Actually, it's already poisoned. I don't think that's going to do much.

Well, I'm going to target the ice troll, and I'm going to do a firebolt.

[Speaker 8]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's...

[Speaker 3]
And then I also have a curse upon me that makes that half as effective.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no!

[Speaker 2]
Maybe double effective, because it might have...

[Speaker 5]
It might be just straight if it's vulnerable.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. All righty. Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yes.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so our boy here is going to make...

[Speaker 3]
His initiative was zero?

[Speaker 1]
Oh. That's so sad. All right, so versus Meshacko, he's going to make two attacks.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez, man.

[Speaker 5]
Just wait. You got one more attack? That misses.

No, that hit! I'm not shield-of-faith currently. I believe it ran out.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sweet. Has it been ten minutes?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's definitely been at least ten minutes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, then it's run out, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then pull damage for five. Whoa, whoa. All right, so you take 17 damage and then five pull damage.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
All righty, so... That was here. Let me just close this out while it's still going on.

Uh, Vanessas, that guy is apparently the Anistag. He's going down here, just full sprint. And the fog cloud goes away.

So we have a hound here who is still trapped within his net, so I'm going to roll his attempt to get out again.

[Speaker 2]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Which failed.

[Speaker 4]
Maia picks up. I will sit behind the troll. All right.

Stepping through a wall. I'd like to go around to the left side of it.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Just one second. You can do your thing.

I just accidentally took the hound for some reason.

[Speaker 4]
She'll make two attacks. Two 20s to hit. Hits.

The first would have sneak attack, which is 3d6, I think it was. And the second attacks damage. And she'll send a kick at it as well.

Turn done for 32 damage. No. 31 damage.

[Speaker 1]
How would you like to do this?

[Speaker 4]
She sends her kunai at its ankles to get it to kneel down. She just jumps up and kicks it in the head. It just hits the ground.

[Speaker 1]
You love to see it. All righty. Is that the end of your turn?

Yep. Turn done. It is your turn.

Where is this character?

[Speaker 2]
It dashed away.

[Speaker 1]
It dashed away?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So... You might not be able to get a good vision of it.

[Speaker 7]
I don't have a net. So all we have to do here is net this final dog, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's laying about. We've taken off. The hound's looking to pass it.

I think there's a net right next to it, honestly.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I don't know how to toss a net.

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 7]
I'll end my turn, because I don't have a net. Fair enough. I'll probably add that to my inventory.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Okay, so this thing is going to be here. I think it's just going to attempt to bite Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Let it try.

[Speaker 1]
Small attack. Is that a 15 hit? Nope.

18 hit. That hits though.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, how much of that is cold? D6, I think?

[Speaker 1]
The 4 is cold.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I take 2 damage from this thing. So 9.

[Speaker 1]
Is that it? That's it for its turns. And you are up.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll command my wolf to continue chasing down the anus hag and see if I can butcher her. Otherwise, I will continue to try to knock this guy out if I can. I don't have any nets, so it's a normal leisurely.

That looks like a hit.

[Speaker 1]
That's a hit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. One more of these.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, yep. That will knock him out.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, okay. Donk. Okay, and with my movement I'm going to try to get into visual range of the anus hag, so let's see how much movement was that.

15, 10, that's 25, I've got another 10 feet of movement. Still my turn, so I wasn't quite done yet.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're still good to do stuff, I just clicked off so I could click on the...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I can move.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think there's a terrain wall there.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, is there?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, which should be restricting line of sight, but it's not, so I'm going to delete these.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, 10, 20, oh yeah, I can get in range for the foot movement. It's going to rush up and bite out her heels.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, womp womp. Oh well. Oh, fortunately.

Yeah. And yeah, I can't do anything more than that, so let's end my turn.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here, I think it's going to be the end of combat here, because the wolf is just going to kill the anus hag next round.

[Speaker 5]
I was going to try and do it this round, but if you just say the wolf does it, the wolf does it.

[Speaker 1]
You are, like, many entries down the... Can you get...

[Speaker 5]
I got a range spell that I'm willing to try.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you even know where this thing is.

[Speaker 5]
I'd have to go north and follow. Yeah, never mind. The wolf just gets the hag.

[Speaker 1]
The wolf's going to get it, so we're going to end combat.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Same system as before.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to snag three more collars.

[Speaker 5]
Chain up these three also, and claim back our nets.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. The wolf eventually comes back, dragging anus hag corpse along with it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, perfect. I wanted to loot her too.

[Speaker 4]
The hag had turned into a puddle or something, I think. Is that what they've previously done?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so when the creatures die... Actually, I don't know. I think the reason you guys couldn't loot the anus hag last time was kind of the...

Because it wasn't actually killed, I think Para EBD'd it down to another plane of existence. Ah. Never mind, then.

[Speaker 7]
My bad.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I would like to have a short rest if the others don't mind.

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone need healing?

[Speaker 6]
I always need healing and short rests.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm just going to do something. I don't know if it looks on me.

[Speaker 1]
While you guys do that, I'm going to grab some coffee. Also, let me know if anybody is keeping a watch.

[Speaker 3]
How much is everyone down? I'm down 33.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? Before anybody takes anything, I need to know if anybody is taking a watch and if so, who.

[Speaker 4]
I have the perfect person to keep watch.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was going to do that on myself.

[Speaker 6]
That is pretty smart.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't mind keeping watch. I'm just going to do some improvised healing myself.

[Speaker 3]
I was going to do a prayer of healing real quick.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'm missing 10. If I can get in on that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just use one die, so if I roll above a...

[Speaker 3]
So, I can choose six people who get 26 healing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that'll be quite enough.

[Speaker 3]
So, everyone you choose gets 26?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Yes?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Nice!

[Speaker 3]
Yes, everyone. And I believe there's six of us, yeah? Or, well, I guess there's one more because of the wolf.

How's the wolf doing?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it didn't take any damage. So, not that much either.

[Speaker 5]
And I'll lay on hands myself for the rest of my missing HP.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think you took more damage than anyone else.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you, Para. You're my favorite.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to get a drink. I'll be back in a second.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are good to take probably a 20 minute break.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, thanks.

[Speaker 2]
And while everyone else is taking their risks, I'll help chain up these doggos that we take the collars off. If anyone wants to mutilate the corpse of the innocent hags, then I'm able to help.

[Speaker 5]
I'm willing to help on... I believe this character has survival, so I'd be willing to help with the harvesting of the ice-troll and hag as well.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. I have survival as well. We'll go put them down.

Come back in a bit.

[Speaker 5]
So, which of us want to roll for the survivals? My survival roll isn't too good. I got a plus 6.

Is yours better than that?

[Speaker 3]
Could I possibly make an argument for medicine to harvest from a troll and a hag?

[Speaker 5]
You'd have to bring that up to James, but... Surgical.

[Speaker 3]
What is your medicine versus 6? Uh, my medicine's a 14.

[Speaker 5]
That would be a very good reason to argue for it.

[Speaker 6]
What? And I never roll medicine. What'd I miss?

Uh...

[Speaker 5]
Otto trying to convince the wrong person to let her roll medicine for the harvesting of the troll and hag.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I wasn't sure if he was here or not.

[Speaker 2]
I'm back. But I think James is back.

[Speaker 5]
He said we have, like, 10, 20, I believe?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, he's been in here. Does it have to be medicine? Can it be date cure?

[Speaker 3]
Well, I wanted to use medicine because I have a 14. That's the only reason I wanted to use medicine.

[Speaker 6]
My nature is nowhere near that good. What's your survival? Why are you wet?

Where have you been?

[Speaker 3]
Ah, the eternal struggle of pets. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I know that she's a sloppy eater. Not eater, drinker.

[Speaker 3]
We have a cat fountain and my darling-est August likes to stick his head under the fountain to drink the water underneath where it hits the water and he always gets his head wet and he always is like, why am I getting wet?

[Speaker 6]
My orange one-cell bray baby. My dad's orange drinks with his paws so he dabbles in the water and then he licks it off his paws and then he comes and stands on us.

[Speaker 5]
Oh. That's about right for a cat. My two four-legged pets, two adorable little Shih Tzus.

You swear they shouldn't be able to jump as high as they did. But they went floor to at the time my shoulders which I grew about a foot or so since then. So five-ish foot is where I'd say my head was at that point.

But anyways. Two little Shih Tzus ground to the shoulders. Ah.

Crazy things pets do.

[Speaker 3]
My friend had a cat that would literally mountain climb you to get to your shoulders and he was a twenty-one pound main raccoon.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, big boy. That's a that's a fat cat.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, he was not fat. He was muscles.

[Speaker 5]
Well, it doesn't fit with the saying then. I would never call my dogs sea dogs though. I've never seen them anywhere near a body of water larger than a lake.

But yeah, I guess to a dog that size, a lake would have been a sea or an ocean. All of that perspective. One thing I will say though Burdock.

Hate that plant.

[Speaker 3]
It can all burn. Burdock is delicious. Burdock?

[Speaker 5]
The little thing that sticks into fur coats of pets Oh, that shit.

[Speaker 2]
Thistle. Yeah, we have something version like that down here in New Zealand. That's nasty.

Oh, it's awful. God.

[Speaker 5]
You may have to cut it out or try and comb it out. Then end up getting sick of it and cut it out anyways. There's a reason when my dogs were still with us they were called rat dogs more often than not.

When they're supposed to be called mop dogs.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, generally they look like little mop heads without the broom handle on them. I think one time me and my siblings tied a broom handle to one of them when they actually had the long hair. Oh, we got grounded for a little bit for that.

[Speaker 8]
Because, yeah. Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we do have burdock here in New Zealand. We call it thistle though.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, thistle. That stuff is annoying and it can just burn.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Because we have a lot of sheep and stuff like that down here and it gets right up into their wool and whatnot. It's fucking awful because it grows all over the farms.

[Speaker 5]
It likes places... I'm trying to remember if that's a shade plant or a... yeah, it's a shade weed and that's where pets tend to like to congregate to cool off.

Other than by water, which tend to have it anyways.

[Speaker 3]
I think we get like burrs, but nothing really that bad, but I also don't own dogs, so. That's the good thing about cats.

[Speaker 5]
They tend to be indoors like 90% of the time.

[Speaker 6]
Or at least they should be.

[Speaker 2]
Our cats are indoor cats. Yeah, because when they get outside, they just kill everything.

[Speaker 5]
Well, the 10% that aren't are barn cats. And they're there too.

[Speaker 3]
There's some outdoor cats that aren't barn cats. I don't live near a barn and we have a lot of like cats that just kind of hang out outside. Yeah, I know.

That's sad, though. Cats are lovely creatures. Oh, they are well-fed creatures.

They're just always outside because they want to be. The person who tries to take care of them because they're all strays. That is why they're there.

Yeah, we had one cat that had gotten out or gotten left here and she kept getting preggers so often that like I usually saw her with a big old belly more than I saw her without. She did eventually get spayed and adopted by someone, but there are still so many cats out there. That's how it goes.

But all of them have since been taken care of, so no random kitten babies. Until the next one pops up. Well, that's if someone like drops one and abandons them, so hopefully not.

[Speaker 5]
It's a sad thing when it happens, but it does happen, sadly. Usually it's there to the shelter soon after that happens, but cats are good hiders.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, thankfully we have one lady who always has food out, so she's really cued in on when there's new cats, and she always, once she spots a new one, tries to earn her trust, and as soon as she can, she takes them in. Hmm. That's good.

[Speaker 5]
But a Maine Coon cat, eh?

[Speaker 3]
That's a little bigger of a cat than I wanna have. I adore Maine Coons. I think they're adorbs.

I know they're adorable, but I think they get the idea that they're the boss.

[Speaker 5]
I think all cats have that idea.

[Speaker 3]
That is a very fair point. I mean, August conned me into getting not one, but two pillows on my desk for him, and just him. Granted, now Dex takes the other one, but...

He was looking out for his buddy. To a point. No, he was looking out for himself, because Dex kept stealing his pillow.

[Speaker 5]
So you got a spare so he could have one after Dex steals the pillow.

[Speaker 3]
Not that it helps, because this is a picture from earlier, and Dex is just laying on him.

[Speaker 5]
Adorable! So the orange kitty looks about ready to smack a gray kitty.

[Speaker 3]
He usually tolerates it for about ten minutes before he just stands up and tries to move, but sometimes he does go and attack.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't say attack, I just said smack the kitty, go away. You know that. Yeah, that's him attacking.

That's about as far as he ever has gone.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he just tries to smack him away, but Dex does not listen, and within five minutes he'll just turn around and flop back down and start cleaning him again. The orange boy is pretty old. Yeah, he's the old coot of the house.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, a Tordy! I love Tordys! Her name is Toast.

She's recently discovered a love of being tucked in. She's a Wisconsin Concrete Cat.

[Speaker 3]
That's my dad's cat, Xena. Aww. She loves to roll around and look like a sausage.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, Toaster's tubby sausage.

[Speaker 5]
And you know those two Shih Tzus I was speaking about? The small lilyappy things? Guess what type of dog one of them had four of in a corner while the two of them ate?

[Speaker 8]
Great game.

[Speaker 5]
No, not quite that big, but four Rottweilers. Wow.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like Rottweilers have this aggressive reputation, but I have never seen a Rottweiler that was not just a squishy little marshmallow baby. Fair. My friend has one and they are just such babies.

They're cowards about everything and they are constantly like I'm a little lap dog! Yeah, second only to Labrador on that one. Labradors love pets and snuggles as well.

A couple weekends from now I'm gonna be babysitting a Shiba Inu.

[Speaker 8]
A what?

[Speaker 3]
A Shiba. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
One of those yowly Japanese dogs.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the ones with the little curly tails.

[Speaker 3]
Have you ever seen the Doge meme? That's a Shiba.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, those. Okay. Just, no.

Sushi wouldn't go over well with them, would it? Maybe.

[Speaker 3]
I've met the one that I'm gonna be babysitting and she is very princess-ia. I would go over to her owner's house to do massages and she discovered oh, I like the taste of the coconut oil. Can I have some every time?

So yeah, you might not want to give her sushi.

[Speaker 5]
She might want that for supper instead of the canned food.

[Speaker 3]
She gets a burrito, I guess, like once a week. She is spoiled.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to guess your cat's ages.

[Speaker 3]
Five and seven on the first picture? Or older on the orange cat? Orange cat, we don't really actually know how old he was.

He was a Turbo Rescue and then he was a Rescue after that. Turbo Rescue? Yeah, he was a barn cat when he was a baby and then when his little testes came in, his owners decided to try and castrate him the same way they castrate bulls.

[Speaker 6]
Oh no!

[Speaker 3]
And they took him to the vet and they were like, oh, we don't know what happened. And the vet was like, should you own cats? And they were like, no, probably not.

So the vet offered to take him in and he had a sibling as well who was even older, who was in the same predicament. But Auggie didn't like his previous owners because she was a vet and he doesn't like vets. And so they pretty much, once they moved here, they just left him outside.

And so one winter, we brought him in and gave him salmon and he has not left since. And they were like, well, since he likes you guys so much more than us, you guys can just have him. Dex, however, we know how old he is.

He is just under two years old. That's a... I suppose cats do get big quick.

I forgot about that last time I... Well, we're not really sure what kind of cat he is because cats don't really do breeds unless you're really particular. But yeah, he got almost as big as Auggie and Auggie was a pretty big boy.

Xena, by contrast, is incredibly small. She's like half the size of the other two boys and she's like, I want to say seven, eight, maybe. Oh God, she's almost ten.

She's older than ten. So is Auggie. They're both definitely older than ten because we had them when I was in high school and it's been a while.

Yeah. I think it is officially almost eleven years since I've been in high school.

[Speaker 5]
Wick and Pogo that I speak of, they made it to... Their life expectancy is fourteen, right? They managed to hold on until seventeen, eighteen.

They lived good lives. Long lives. And I'd like to think it was good.

[Speaker 3]
Even with Auggie's seizures, he's still doing pretty good. Like, he's holding on strong. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
These little guys are more resilient than a lot of people give them credit for.

[Speaker 3]
Especially when you treat them right. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It was always a point of pride for the... It was always a point of pride for our farm that everything lived longer while they were there. We were like, oh yeah, listen.

The moment you get a Tennessee walker up to, like, world record lifespans, it feels pretty good.

[Speaker 7]
Hmm. Yeah. What is a Tennessee walker?

[Speaker 1]
That's a breed of horse. Oh, cool.

[Speaker 7]
That's super cool. Huh. The cat I just gave meds to, I don't know if people saw that.

The cat is eighteen years old. She had to have a tooth removed, so I'm giving her an antibiotic. Aww.

He's still kicking the ass. He's doing good.

[Speaker 3]
Hopefully it's easier to give her meds.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Hopefully it ain't a pill that you have to try in disguise and peanut butter and fail because they always seem to take the peanut butter and spit out the pill.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that's a dog. Luckily it's a liquid antibiotic, so I'm okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I just remember having discussions with my dog, you're going to have this. Hehehe.

I still swear the dog won more often than I did half the time.

[Speaker 3]
My vets can't even give August medicine unless they have six people holding him down. The only reason I'm able to give him medicine is because it is a powder and I mix it into his favorite food.

[Speaker 5]
That is smart.

[Speaker 6]
We've got a cat right now who has to take prednisone and the best way we've figured out how to do it is to grind it up and dissolve it in some water and syringe it into her mouth. Nobody really enjoys doing that.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, man, whatever works. Whatever helps keep the pet healthy. Or the poor baby.

[Speaker 5]
Whatever you want to call it.

[Speaker 6]
She's allergic to something in our house and we think it's the last brand of soap we used to mop the floors. So we've changed that out. She hasn't started getting better yet.

[Speaker 5]
Then you might want to keep an eye out for other things as well.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So Zena actually had a severe allergy for years. She lost all the hair on her butt. We could not figure out what it was.

We'd take her to the vet. They would comb her. No fleas.

We gave her flea blasts. Nothing got better. The vet eventually changed the brand of flea medicine we had from, I think, Advantage to Revolution.

Within a week her hair started growing back. She was not as itchy. We're like, you couldn't find any fleas.

[Speaker 6]
But the flea med fixed the problem. Well, the flea med fixed the problem because the flea med was causing the problem.

[Speaker 3]
Well, see, the thing is we hadn't given her the Advantage because we thought that the flea problem was eliminated. But then they were like, nah, apparently they were just invisible fleas. Who knows.

And she hasn't had the issue since.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, so how did you guys turn out with the short rest? Doing good.

[Speaker 3]
I wanted to know, could I use medicine to help with harvesting the anise hag or the ice troll?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, I'll give you Advantage. You do your medicine. Let me see if I got medicine.

I got the survival but I don't got medicine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I got survival as well.

[Speaker 5]
Let me check.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have to be able to roll it in order to...

[Speaker 1]
I think the aid, you don't have to roll for it, right? Go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
With an aid, you don't have to roll it, do you?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I don't think so.

[Speaker 4]
You'd have to be trained in it to help.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, do you?

[Speaker 1]
So I'll just roll it normally?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So I think you just roll normally.

[Speaker 5]
I got skill in both medicine and survival if she needs help.

[Speaker 1]
25 works. Is this on the troll or... The troll or anise hag is what I meant to say.

[Speaker 3]
I think we're going to go with the anise hag.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so the anise hag, you get a... Let's see here. You get the coin gizzard which is filled with a number of iron coins and is quite...

I can filter it by class. Jeez. So that's what you get for the anise hag.

[Speaker 7]
So are we harvesting as a story element or is this just for loot?

[Speaker 6]
I was hoping to harvest the troll for something worth crafting. Ah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Is the coin gizzard good for crafting?

[Speaker 1]
Yes it is.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'll pass that over to you.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, awesome.

[Speaker 6]
I will make it. Nope. Alright.

Since you did incredibly well, you want to go at the ice troll for me? Uh, sure.

[Speaker 1]
Eighteen. Alrighty, you get the ice troll's heart.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, that's kind of helpful. And I'll pass that over as well. Thank you, you're definitely my favorite.

[Speaker 8]
Well...

[Speaker 5]
So, where to next? I suppose we continue looking around and try and find the guy.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, these guys came from the south west, so... And the other hand I fled to the north somewhere, so... Those two directions I think.

I can't imagine it's too difficult to follow troll tracks back to where they came from.

[Speaker 8]
Uh...

[Speaker 1]
No, no it's not. Here. The tracks lead back this way.

[Speaker 2]
Do we want to go sneaky sneak? Yes, please.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, should we be rolling stealth? Here we go.

[Speaker 2]
Hold on.

[Speaker 5]
Twenty-five.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Twenty-seven.

[Speaker 4]
If Maia's mounted, does the dragon just need to roll or does she need to roll as well?

[Speaker 1]
I think the dragon can probably roll. The dragon is the important part of that quest. Fair enough.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
You folks move over. There's not really much here. It looks like the...

It does look like the troll was in the middle carving another totem. On the ground over here, which is what they typically use as weapons if they're in the valley, but... Didn't get a chance to finish.

Indeed not. Feel a bit guilty about that.

[Speaker 6]
How big is the totem?

[Speaker 1]
Probably about eight feet tall, about two feet wide and deep.

[Speaker 2]
Do I see any other tracks in the area?

[Speaker 1]
None besides at this point, no. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
What are we thinking?

[Speaker 8]
I'm thinking up.

[Speaker 2]
Do they have the same kind of injuries we saw on the other corpses?

[Speaker 1]
Much the same.

[Speaker 2]
There's a trail of corpses hidden this way.

[Speaker 8]
I see a lake. That looks it.

[Speaker 5]
I'd say we head to the other side of the thing over here.

[Speaker 2]
I think that's where we fought the other hound earlier.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, and I'm saying we continue north from there because it looks like the ice is...

[Speaker 1]
Everything re-intensifies just a little bit. Oops.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, more bodies.

[Speaker 5]
Those are the ones we found originally. Okay, this is just a big river.

[Speaker 2]
A frozen lake, yeah. Something like that. Not sure how wide it spans, but...

Does it look solid enough to hold our weight?

[Speaker 1]
I'd say so. I think it looks solid.

[Speaker 2]
I'm a little more concerned about the dragon, to be honest. I see... something.

Something big.

[Speaker 4]
A dragon can fly.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, yours is a nice dragon, isn't it?

[Speaker 4]
What the hell am I looking at? That's a kobold dragon.

[Speaker 6]
You should've brought a white one. No offense. Oh.

[Speaker 5]
What the hell am I looking at? Is that what I think it is?

[Speaker 1]
It's a vision of this one.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna move back to where I was before.

[Speaker 7]
I sense we're running away.

[Speaker 5]
We're regrouping, figuring out what we're going to do.

[Speaker 6]
It's a strategic retreat.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't know why people are retreating when I said initiative.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, then I'll bring myself back where I was.

[Speaker 4]
I was here when you moved forward.

[Speaker 1]
I knew why... Let me end combat here. I knew why Tera was moving back.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't hear you at the time say that, so thank you for telling me.

[Speaker 4]
Is the jargon fine to act on my turn, James? Yeah, they work perfectly. I've just added it to initiative.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. I'll set it to... Oh, it's right.

Perfect. I will roll initiative in a second.

[Speaker 4]
Not that I can see it. If this hypothetically is the big bad, Tera, we need to get in close to it. If I can hit it with a stunning strike, you can just nuke it with herb dice, and we can stun it, and it's incapacitated, we can put the shackles on it.

Unless it's too big of a shackle. Then we've got a problem.

[Speaker 3]
I do want to drop a darkness somewhere that's not going to bother everyone else, hopefully.

[Speaker 2]
He's just in the dungeon, but...

[Speaker 3]
I need to spend my next downtime to buy a bunch of magical darkness seeing goggles or something.

[Speaker 6]
Sounds like a really bad idea, considering we were told not to take our eyes off him.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'd love that.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not going to hit him with it, but nearby, so that Maya can teleport.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody's done initiative. I'm going to begin... Let's hear it.

You guys hear the sound of ice skates.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Go against the lake's surface, and then you hear what sounds like a bow. Okay. That'll be against the dragon.

What the heck? All right. That'll be plus another...

Oh, I see what I'm wrong. That should be plus 6 for his modifier, then plus 4 for favorite enemy. So 17 damage to the dragon while I go in and edit this.

That'll be his turn. Robin! Okie dokie.

[Speaker 2]
I probably heard where this is coming from, but I think we probably can figure out it's coming somewhere from behind us. But I'm going to take the thing that's in front of us to keep it off our ass, so I'm going to send my wolf up to attack it, and I'm going to shoot this thing in the face.

[Speaker 1]
I hope that hits. 26 absolutely hits.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. Take another shot. Okay.

And then have my wolf take a chunk out of it. Assuming that hits.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okie dokie.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's immune to cold, so that d6 probably isn't going to do anything. That gives 5 points of damage, I think.

[Speaker 1]
Probably 8, because of your modifier. Or I'm guessing it's...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like... It's a d6 of piercing and another d6 of cold.

[Speaker 1]
Right, and that little plus 3 there is probably what's going to damage it.

[Speaker 2]
And yeah, that's it.

[Speaker 1]
That was good. Whenever you guys roll attacks, just go ahead and roll damage at the same time. And I'll let you know if it doesn't disappear.

[Speaker 4]
Okie dokie. Utilizing the dragon's 60 foot fly speed. That's going to take off and move forward.

What is that? Have I ever seen anything like this before, Gene?

[Speaker 1]
This thing here? Probably not.

[Speaker 4]
Cobalt can do its breath attack at it. Trying to avoid hitting the ice. Oops, it never recharged its attack.

Why isn't it fighting? If it's immune to cold, it'll just take the 15 fire.

[Speaker 1]
It is, in fact, immune to cold.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I'll then draw her crossbow and shoot 5 bolts at it with a miss, I assume.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that unfortunately misses.

[Speaker 4]
The second attack shall fire 3 more. Hit. I think for 24 damage, it's 3 bolts of flame into it.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to mark the spots where the ice is a little fucky. The dragon's about 10 feet off the ground. Alrighty, is that your turn?

Yep. Alright, so... Did it move?

It's going to move, but I can sprawl out once I hit that, so let's go do it. Your bolt can make an attack of opportunity when you do this.

[Speaker 2]
Uh-huh. Target it, junk. Uh, oof.

It's a thing. I think that's going to hit. Yeah, I figured it out.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so I need everything inside this freezing breath here.

[Speaker 2]
I think my water's outside of it, so...

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
I think Maia doesn't count as being in that from where I positioned her.

[Speaker 1]
What, she's just like riding on the wing? Yeah. It's a pain in the ass to say that.

[Speaker 6]
Is Para technically in that?

[Speaker 1]
I think Para's outside of it. I think I would need like half of your whatchamacallit being there. I think Telqua is also safe.

Alright. Corona, Robin, Mushako, and the Cobalt Dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, it's a fail, but it's cold damage, so I still take half anyway.

[Speaker 1]
Same for the dragon. This is... Damage is here.

52 on a failed saving throw. Halfway success.

[Speaker 2]
So... It's done a little.

[Speaker 4]
Just right-click the damage and go apply half damage. You've got your token selected.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, nice!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, I didn't know I could do that.

[Speaker 4]
I fucking love foundry.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, apply half. Makes sense. That's very useful.

I did not know I could do that. I learn something new every day. Oh, and I've got to make a con save for concentration.

[Speaker 1]
Fail.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, I'm not concentrating anymore. Oh! Not that it's doing as much good, but...

[Speaker 1]
Hang on. Hang on. This'll be perfect.

So, after the frost salamander does that, it is going to burrow under the ice.

[Speaker 2]
Might as well do that.

[Speaker 1]
Does that leave a hole in the ice? It does.

[Speaker 4]
That would trigger an attack from the dragon if it does that, so I'll attack it now with a bite.

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 4]
That's a miss.

[Speaker 8]
Mm-mm.

[Speaker 7]
Is it currently above the ice now, or is it still below?

[Speaker 1]
Nope, it's still below. You guys see a shape swimming below the, uh, swimming below the surface. That's very creepy.

Here, I see an ice image. Okay. Second one.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Third one.

[Speaker 7]
Move up. Ooh. Ooh.

That's the wrong guy. So I don't see the other bad guy. Nope.

[Speaker 2]
No, we haven't seen him yet. He shot us from afar.

[Speaker 7]
Alright. I'm assuming I can't cast anything on the salamander below the ice?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it depends where you're attempting to cast on him.

[Speaker 7]
Bonus action. Curse. Excurse.

Exploits Curse.

[Speaker 1]
I don't... Let's see if you can see him. Exploits Curse isn't a spell, and provided you could see him, I don't see why not.

[Speaker 7]
Well, there you go.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that's the end of my turn. Sorry.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Alright. Para, you are up.

[Speaker 3]
Baconing everyone again.

[Speaker 7]
Love to hear.

[Speaker 3]
And... Let's see. Hang on.

Oh, it's below the ice. It probably can't hear me, so I'm not going to do a squeak. And I think that is all I have right now.

[Speaker 2]
Just start moving, of course.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Do I want to move?

[Speaker 2]
There's a giant shadow coming up underneath you, so... I imagine if it's under the ice, it wouldn't be able to burrow through into the ground. It might only be able to pop out through ice.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think I will try and back up.

[Speaker 2]
Let's hope it can't burrow through the ground.

[Speaker 3]
And then that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Mijako.

[Speaker 5]
Mijako is going to be going over here and dodging with the Shield of Faith. Let me just...

[Speaker 1]
And Corona, you look relatively safe over there. Are you mutant?

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, I was, yes. I had a huge sneeze earlier. I moved back, and can I hold which bolt until it comes up?

Absolutely. Alright. That's it for me.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Okay, cool. Hey!

It's this guy's turn. Let's see here. A 40-foot cylinder gets everybody.

Alright, folks. I need a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw from everybody.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, half or none. Let's see what you get. None!

Nice!

[Speaker 2]
Is it a bolt or not? Ah, wow. And I'll buff my wolf as well.

[Speaker 6]
Where are Para and Telqua?

[Speaker 2]
Both are terrible. Good God.

[Speaker 7]
Telqua is to the north. Sort of near the front there.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 36 damage on a failed save. Or half on a success.

[Speaker 3]
What type of damage does it happen to be?

[Speaker 1]
Hearsay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Jesus.

[Speaker 1]
Shieldmaster evasion. That's right! This is like the one paladin that's good at making deck saves.

Let's see here. And then he's gonna move.

[Speaker 6]
Uh-uh. Not good enough.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Vanessa's gonna swing by here. Make a kick with one of his skates.

[Speaker 3]
A kick 10 feet up.

[Speaker 1]
Are you still 10 feet up?

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I don't know where you got that from. I'm gonna have him move down here. Add Para instead.

23 to hit Para.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
14 slashing damage. Oh, I'm just gonna take him further down. He's going to intentionally move another 20 feet.

And at the end of his turn, because he's skating, he's going to move 60 feet, so he's gonna move an additional...

[Speaker 3]
Do I get an opportunity for that, or...? Because he hit you?

[Speaker 1]
No, you do not.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, fair.

[Speaker 1]
It's like, uh, basically the owl's flyby. It's conditional. Unless you have...

Unless anybody here has Sentinel.

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Speaker 1]
So he swings further down there. Robin, it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, uh, I don't particularly appreciate Breach's shot at. Um, I am going to... Cast Death Strike.

And I am gonna zip on down after him. If I can find him, because I have a shit ton of movement. You're not the only one who can move fast.

And I'm gonna take a couple shots at him. Because screw this guy. Um, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

Okay, first attack will be a third vantage. Yep, I assume that hits. Okay, nine, and the damage from Death Strike as well.

And one more attack. Pew-pew. And then, yeah, my pet will be taking the, uh, dodge action in the meantime.

How much movement do I have left? Uh, let's see, I moved 45 feet. I think I still have another bit.

I'm gonna stay close enough so I can actually keep an eye on him. But with a certain range of other people, in case I go down. Which is not a non-zero chance.

[Speaker 4]
Is Para willing to get grappled by the dragon?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, sure.

[Speaker 4]
I want to take you with me. Uh, grapple Para. Funny.

I'm gonna get right up in this guy's face. And, um, I just need to be close enough so I can stunning strike this guy. Am I just gonna do like a flip off the dragon and get, like, to here?

[Speaker 8]
Mhm.

[Speaker 4]
And, uh, she's gonna attack with her, uh, she's just gonna drop the crossbow and draw her kunai and stab at this guy. Uh, first attack. The 14 missed.

[Speaker 1]
14 unfortunately does miss.

[Speaker 4]
Second attack hits, which now... I make him do stunning strike save.

[Speaker 1]
Already.

[Speaker 4]
And I ask Para to dump, like, three or four herb dice into this silly fail.

[Speaker 1]
To start off with, I need you to make me a count save. Ha ha ha. Reversal.

You are stunned.

[Speaker 3]
Can I do herb dice to assist with that?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 3]
Ha ha. Okay, so do I say how many I'm gonna use and then roll it, or...

[Speaker 1]
You say how many you're gonna use and then you roll.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... Two or three?

[Speaker 4]
Three? Two? Is the DC against my own DC?

Per reversal? Or is it... Okay.

Probably three. It's huge. It's huge.

Um... I have my bonus action still. I'm gonna kick him, and you've heard it before.

I'm gonna try and stunning strike him.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Has a reaction to being hit. He's gonna cast a spell.

[Speaker 2]
Wasn't the reversal thing already a reaction?

[Speaker 4]
It's just another legendary reaction.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Dragon would be one. I still can't see her. Her wings are so big.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. It's protecting her. How many creatures?

Oh, I'm definitely doing...

[Speaker 4]
Does this go off before or after the stunning strike?

[Speaker 1]
This goes off before. If he succeeds on this, he gets to... I guess it's not a success thing.

He just does it. Okay, so... 21 versus Maia.

Oh, because its base health is gone. Alright, against Pera. 17 to hit.

[Speaker 8]
That's a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Versus the dragon. Also definitely a miss.

[Speaker 7]
Huge.

[Speaker 1]
Versus... Let's see what we're gonna do. Versus Koroma.

For 21. And then against Mijako. For 14.

Okay. If you were hit by this, you'd take... Just Maia and Koroma.

Maia and Koroma take 37 force damage. And he teleports next to Koroma.

[Speaker 4]
But does he get stunned?

[Speaker 1]
He does not.

[Speaker 4]
He doesn't take the damage at all? Nope.

[Speaker 6]
I'm down. No, you're not.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, the reaction. I have a feeling I know what that salamander...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, the fourth edition, baby. I do the same. No, you don't!

I do the same.

[Speaker 7]
So does that put the salamander in the top?

[Speaker 4]
That was the reaction of the man we're here for.

[Speaker 3]
Did the salamander come up?

[Speaker 4]
Not yet.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Hasn't been the salamander's turn yet.

[Speaker 4]
Is that a mass healing word, or just a regular healing word?

[Speaker 3]
Oh shit, that's supposed to be a regular healing word? I clicked the wrong one.

[Speaker 4]
I think it's the same dice, though.

[Speaker 1]
Maia, do you or your dragon have any turn stuff to do left?

[Speaker 4]
No, but I'll see if it gets its breath attack back. I should have done that at the start, but not quite good.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's the correct one. And that's only on Corona.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Boss salamander's gonna come up, so I'm gonna get rid of this little ice shield thing here. Corona, you can roll your attack against it, or Witch Bolt, while it attacks...

[Speaker 5]
Disadvantage versus me.

[Speaker 1]
Because you're dodging, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Alrighty. For Corona to still cast Witch Bolt, they would have needed to concentrate on the spell.

[Speaker 1]
I think they don't go down because of the...

[Speaker 6]
Reaction?

[Speaker 1]
Because of the reaction.

[Speaker 4]
But you still got hit while casting the spell.

[Speaker 6]
I was holding it.

[Speaker 1]
Right, so what that means is while you're holding it for... If you're holding an action to cast a spell, you concentrate on it during that time. Yeah.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I also remembered I have to roll for Bacon. Which I think I did.

[Speaker 1]
I think you have an advantage on this.

[Speaker 6]
I do? Or she does. Was that Conseva's success?

[Speaker 1]
It was.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Kyrona, you also get 3 more hit points. I forgot that Bacon does max healing on everything. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Does an 18 hit the salamander?

[Speaker 1]
It does. Whenever you roll the hit, just go ahead and roll damage at the same time. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
The module ready set roll does that. James, if you want to get that for Foundry.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? I am going to get that. 20.

Nice. Good hit. Good hit.

I think this thing is at half. Alright, so now it's time to attack Majoko.

[Speaker 8]
Mhm.

[Speaker 1]
19 to hit? Miss. Time for 4 claw attacks.

[Speaker 5]
Come on. That hits.

[Speaker 1]
So 1 claw gets through. With 1d6 plus 5. Which is a grand total of 6 damage.

[Speaker 6]
Wait. Hold on. Okay.

Nevermind. Sorry. Continue.

You're fine.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so that's him. He's going to dive back under the ice. Oh, that chicken.

[Speaker 5]
I get an attack of opportunity then?

[Speaker 1]
You sure do.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
How does that work if you're underwater?

[Speaker 6]
Does it have total cover while it is under the ice?

[Speaker 1]
I'd say... Conditionally, yes. It has cover so if you have something that just relies on line of sight or a spell that relies on line of sight it's going to have issues.

Except it's ice. So really it's realistically it's concealment. It's also conductive.

Yes. If you do enough damage to get through the ice like something like this I think it's reasonable to Awesome. smack him again.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Telqua. Alright.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to start by moving so I can actually see. I'm going to try to target the salamander with Dissonant Whispers which is a psychic attack if you disallow it. I'm fine with that.

[Speaker 1]
I think it works. I think sometimes constructs around dead might be a little weird with it but I don't see why this wouldn't work against him.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to empower my Dissonant Whispers and then he has to make his saving throw. Or flee.

[Speaker 1]
I think across salamander his wisdom save is 22.

[Speaker 7]
Well that's no good. And that ends my turn. Does he take half on the success?

He takes half on the success, yeah. Alright. Yeah, it should have been since I empowered it, it should have been no, nevermind.

What, disadvantage? No, empowered allows rerolls of 1s and 2s but I think that's okay. Sure.

[Speaker 4]
Not necessarily 1s and 2s.

[Speaker 7]
I think you reroll any of the dice you choose up to roll. Yeah. Yeah, I can't see the dice.

That's the problem.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, so if you roll a 2 and a 4, if you click on the 12 it'll expand the damage roll.

[Speaker 1]
While that's happening Perra, you're all on deck.

[Speaker 4]
The dragon will ungrapple you if you wish.

[Speaker 3]
I'm good to stay grappled. I think I want to do Oh, I made everything smaller. Oops.

Gosh, I'm so far away. I think I'm going to do a mass healing word that way I can get myself, Kyrona, and Maya. Does that get me in it?

Or can I just It's only within 30 feet, unfortunately. Well, okay, it's 60 feet but only if I can see you.

[Speaker 7]
So it's 30 feet right now.

[Speaker 3]
It's only if I can see, and I can't see past the 30 foot mark because of the fog.

[Speaker 2]
Same here. I'm angry as well, I think.

[Speaker 4]
What, Maya, Robin, Kyrona, and the dragon?

[Speaker 2]
I'll kill the dragon, why not?

[Speaker 3]
It also does 4 extra because it's full. My healing. My healing.

Yay. It's the 16 plus 4, so 20 total. And that's my Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
That brings us to Mijako.

[Speaker 3]
Actually, that was a bonus action. Can I use a cantrip?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can.

[Speaker 3]
Fuck this guy. Where'd it go? Oh, it's a dexterity save.

Never mind, I'm going to do Firebolt.

[Speaker 1]
17 misses.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, now you can move on.

[Speaker 1]
I tried to exit out of something and immediately got misclicked on the bookmark. There we go.

[Speaker 5]
My turn?

[Speaker 1]
Now it's Mijako's turn.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like to go into flanking with the nature lady here.

[Speaker 1]
Please don't use flanking.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, no. Okay, then I'd like to just attack and prone this guy first. Anyways, see if I can.

Contested athletics.

[Speaker 4]
Or acrobatics, I think.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to shield him. Yeah, I think he passes. So I'll just strike him twice with my longsword at normal.

[Speaker 1]
20 just hits. 24 also hits.

[Speaker 5]
And I'll do normal attacks this time around. I got more spell slots, but I'm going to wait for a little bit on those three. Anyways, end of turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Koroda, you're up.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Um... Boy.

I don't think I... Can I hold concentration on Witch Bolt to damage the elemental and then move away from Vanassis?

[Speaker 2]
I think you automatically lose Witch Bolt if it moves out of your range, which it did.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no. My range is insane. I took Spell Sniper.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I don't think that you have to be...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's in your range, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And you don't have to hold it. Right, which is what Koroda asked earlier. I ruled that it wouldn't count as total cover.

Um... Mostly because of this hole in the ice here. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I just don't know where it is, so I can't weigh in.

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
I think you can just automatically do damage.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so it just does damage for just 1d12. Uh... The secondary damage doesn't get upcast.

Uh, unfortunately.

[Speaker 6]
Yep, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Which I think is dumb. Yep, I agree.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, that sucks. Um... I'm going to fuckin' flee.

Bye.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have a means of escaping without taking an attack of opportunity?

[Speaker 6]
I... don't believe I do. Which is why I wanted to do it after casting.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, you used those reactions earlier, so you're fine.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, those were legendary reactions.

[Speaker 2]
How many legendary reactions does he have?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the same number of legendary reactions that you would expect from a legendary creature. Which is typically 3.

[Speaker 4]
He used a reaction there when I punched him.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, casting a spell was a... was on his legendary reaction list. Because Steel Wind Strike is not a reaction cast-time spell.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, normally it's an action.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Legendary reaction, is that what you're saying, James?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, which one damage, Verona?

[Speaker 6]
Alright, thank you very much.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we come to let's see, at the end of this round how many critters are going to join in.

[Speaker 6]
Please tell me it's not these three back here that I just ran towards?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, those guys are still trapped. Oh, good.

[Speaker 2]
It's those three that ran away earlier to the north.

[Speaker 1]
Give me a moment to think. I have a few different options here. Oh, you know what?

This will work perfectly. We're going to cast Wall of Ice. Where are you casting it?

Don't you worry. Oh. Okay, so I need you to make a deck save.

[Speaker 5]
I take nothing. Which way am I going?

[Speaker 1]
You're going on the other side of the wall. In the meantime, I'm just going to go get us another 40. That's his turn.

20 while skating. Perfect! I think that'll be his turn.

Alright, Robin!

[Speaker 2]
Alright, well I can't do much about him. I'll whistle to my wolf to chase after him if it can see him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, I think it can. I don't think so. Let's see here.

I clicked on the wolf token right now and it has...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but it would have had to go up past him so it would have seen him go in that direction.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think so. His path was basically right along here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's just that he faded.

[Speaker 1]
Why is the token range not equal to the...

[Speaker 4]
It'd be to do with circles. The ruler wouldn't measure it as accurate as the circle would.

[Speaker 1]
I guess... I wasn't expecting to make a ruling like this. What do you think?

Do we use the ruler or the circle for this? The circle's more accurate.

[Speaker 4]
It wouldn't do Pythagoras better.

[Speaker 1]
It's still free to try to stiff him out or something like that. I'm not too terribly worried about it.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, should we make a roll for that? See if it saw which direction it went?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for a perception check.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's see here. Just normal roll. Bad!

So, probably not. It does see the salamander under the water though, so it'll probably come up here and hold its action for it then instead. As for me, I'm gonna run up to old...

Catherine? What's your name here? And I'm going to spend some survival die to try to heal you.

Because why not? Okay, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
While you do that, I'm gonna have one of the hounds take the turn which is gonna be pretty simple. It's just taking dash action.

[Speaker 2]
I'll spend... four die, I think? I can't make the spend multiple die for whatever reason.

So, one, two...

[Speaker 3]
So, Bacon does full healing on any healing. Does that count for this?

[Speaker 1]
Temporary hit points.

[Speaker 2]
It gives temporary hit points, but I've got the improved healing thing that doubles the amount of die and since I'm using a healing kit which I have here somewhere I bought one of these. Yay! Healing kit.

You get healed for the amount and then you gain temporary hit points on top of that. So, heal 20, get 20 temporary hit points.

[Speaker 6]
So I heal by 20 and get 20 temporary hit points. How does that go with Pharah's max healing?

[Speaker 1]
Because it's limited by the amount of damage that you took less, I don't think it's going to... I don't think we need to worry how it will affect it in this case because you already hit the maximum threshold.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty. Oh, I wasn't sure how far down she was.

[Speaker 2]
I have no idea how much...

[Speaker 6]
I was at 17.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Yeah, pretty low. So, that's all I can do for you there.

I moved... How far did I move? 20 feet?

Okay, and then I'll just wobble around this wall in the meantime. And that's all I can do.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that wasn't healing healing, that was temporary healing, right? It was healing healing and temporary hit points. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Because if I use the healing kit, it becomes actual healing and temporary hit points as far as I understand from the ability. I'll bring up the ability so you can see.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so if you use a healer's kit or similar item in the process, the target also regains hit points equal to the number of dice expended. I think it improves...

[Speaker 2]
And then I've got and then I've got field medicine which doubles the amount of healing. As long as the amount of dice is equal or higher than the amount of damage taken, then they heal.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, because the number of dice is like, how many D8s did you...

[Speaker 2]
D10s.

[Speaker 1]
Or D10s.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I used three dice. That adds up to a total of 20.

[Speaker 1]
They took 20 damage. No, no, so the number of dice is... It's not the dice roll, it's the number of dice.

For the actual healing.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, is that how that works? Okay. I thought it was the amount of roll.

[Speaker 1]
You got the temporary healing right, but not the actual healing.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, right. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're good. No, it is a weird mechanic. So instead of getting three dice, Rona would have gotten 20 temporary hit points and three...

No, six, because Trina's doubled. Six actual healing.

[Speaker 6]
How do temporary hit points work?

[Speaker 4]
On top of your... On your character sheet, there's a section under your hit points for temp hit points. If you get hit, you'll lose those first.

Ah, thank you. You still make concentration checks and things as normal with them, it's just they're a buffer, essentially.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, so you did have 17, you would now have 23 and then 20 temporary hit points on top of that. Cool.

[Speaker 6]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. No, it's a... Honestly, it's a good move.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Because that's like soaking an extra hit for basically free. Alright, Maya, it is your turn.

[Speaker 4]
Um... How obscuring is the wall? Because it's not like he was hidden when he moved up north behind it.

[Speaker 1]
It's a wall of ice, so I'm going to say that breaks line of sight.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um... Maya's going to hop back on the dragon.

Would Para like to come for this journey across the wall? Sure. Okay, the dragon will take the dash action doing a 120 foot of movement.

Can Maya do a perception check, just trying to listen for the skater?

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 8]
Um...

[Speaker 2]
That's better than what I've got.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you hear the sound of skating coming from... Oh, if I use this... in this direction.

[Speaker 4]
So I've used about 30 feet of movement to get to there, the dragon still has 90, so I'm just going to start heading. Um... Para?

Here. I've got 45. Ah.

Here they are. Maya's used her action. The dragon has used its action.

I might not go that close, I would have slowed down once seeing it. Yeah, you can move further back if you'd like. Uh...

And we'll be about 20 feet in the air, I think. Maya's got a crossbow in one hand, and a dagger in the other, because it has the light. Crafty.

Ah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, as a legendary reaction to a creature moving within 20 feet of him.

[Speaker 4]
Uh... Pythagoras.

[Speaker 1]
You're 20 feet up in the air.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so it'd be like 22 feet, I think, from him.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Unintentionally metagaming. Gotta love it.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, if there was a time to metagame, it's probably now.

[Speaker 4]
Um... The dragon is 28 feet from it.

[Speaker 1]
28? 28, yeah. I'm going to use that reaction.

[Speaker 4]
28.28 feet from, uh...

[Speaker 5]
Dude.

[Speaker 1]
This is versus Pera? Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
That might hurt a little.

[Speaker 4]
Pera has herb dice, it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, can I use herb dice for that?

[Speaker 1]
It's probably a good idea. If you fail to save any spells you cast, it won't activate until the beginning of your next turn. There you go, you're in the clear.

[Speaker 4]
What's the attack roll for? How does it work? Sorry.

I have to... Is that the only effect from the hit? Nope, now I'm doing damage.

[Speaker 1]
I just wanted to do that first. Is he going to add extra damage? No, what he's going to do...

Pera, I need you to make me a strength-saving throw. Okay, you see a little swarm of ice sprites? Push Pera out of the dragon's grasp.

Now the good news is you have a soft surface below you so you won't be taking fall damage. The bad news is you're going to fall into the ice water after you take the 28 damage.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I do have resistance for cold, so I'm just doing the math real quick here.

[Speaker 7]
You would take...

[Speaker 2]
15, so half, 15, 17 damage. Yeah, 14 total. That sounds about right.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, it would be 7 plus 6, so that's 13, and then you have the 15 that's 7, so that's 20. Yeah, 14 total. No, 20 total.

[Speaker 4]
20 in total, because it's 57 plus 6. Yeah, there you go. And then it's 15 half to 7.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, so it's the plus 6 there. Yeah, that's not included when you look at the dice rolls.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was looking at it. It's wrapped up in the formula. 20, yeah.

Alright, it's Frostmail Manor's turn, so it's going to run over, and I think it's going to grapple Pera.

[Speaker 2]
It's still underwater, I assume. Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It is not proficient in athletics.

[Speaker 3]
Strength save, right?

[Speaker 1]
Strength... Either you can use acrobatics or athletics. You make it!

[Speaker 8]
Nice!

[Speaker 1]
He's going to... I have to call you a bunch of times. Alright, which of those hit?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, three of them.

[Speaker 1]
Damage... Alright, so 11, 6, and 6. It's the end of the Frostmail Manor's turn, bringing us to Tel'quad.

[Speaker 7]
Okay, I'm gonna try to do something that I don't know how to do. I'm going to twin a spell.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, target two creatures. And that should do it.

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to cast Vortex Warp and move Pera out of the water. She's in the water now, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Yes! Uh, so are you able to put the spell...

Hey, you have the spell book, so whenever you're casting a spell, just click on it. That goes... There we go.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it's just taking me time. No worries. So I can move...

Basically, I'm going to move Pera out of the water to... Uh... Closer to the ice ball.

I don't know how to indicate where I want her to go.

[Speaker 1]
If you hold down left click...

[Speaker 7]
There we go. And then I want to put the dog in the water.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's the dog that's... Okay, I clicked the wrong guy. Save and throw.

So Pera goes with me.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, he fails. Right on. Alright.

I did something useful. The noob did something useful. Well done, that's good.

[Speaker 1]
Pera was going to be taking cold damage. She was going to be taking...

[Speaker 3]
Was I? Because I can tolerate up to negative 100 Fahrenheit.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you're good to go then.

[Speaker 7]
And then I'm going to move towards the wall now. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
The boots be helpful.

[Speaker 7]
God bless those boots.

[Speaker 1]
If that's the end of your turn, then it's going to be Pera's turn. Thank you. Nice.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to cure wounds myself.

[Speaker 2]
That sounds like a good plan.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, anything for the bonus action?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I don't think so.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to have Mijako go up next.

[Speaker 5]
Mijako's hearing a lot of things going on north, so he's going to try and head around the wall to the north if he can reach there. Dashing to get there.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Mijako, make me a Dex save.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Let me open the sheet again. Dex save.

[Speaker 1]
What did I just take half of? Uh, nothing. You succeed.

It's a DC 10 to not fall prone.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. Well, that's my turn. I believe Sacred Flame's an action, not a bonus action, ain't it?

Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's my turn. Over there.

[Speaker 1]
It is your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I was muted again. I'm going to move up. Is the salamander within 60 feet of me?

Yes. Alright, and he is still Witch Bolted.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, he is.

[Speaker 6]
Actually designed this character. Her Eldritch Bolt goes the length of three football fields.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez. Hmm. Um, let's see here.

It's still technically out of, uh, a... Those of you who are near the frost salamander can see it's really not looking too good. Frankly, now there's the avatar of Banastas over here.

Do you have anything for your bonus action?

[Speaker 6]
Sure. I will have my familiar attack. Let's see if this thing can be poisoned.

Oh. Not with that kind of roll.

[Speaker 1]
I'm afraid that's going to miss.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Ready. The town is going to dash over. Let's go to the next round.

It's round four. Banastas is up. You know what?

He's going to actually do... Oh, we're going to move first. We're going to attack twice with advantage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's, um... Does the kobold have immunity or resistance to... Yeah, it's immune to cold.

Oh. It is immune. It's immune to cold.

That means the first one... Yeah, he's ten. And then the second one is sixteen.

[Speaker 8]
Three feet. And then end his turn. Skating further.

Robert, you are up.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. Um... I have no idea where he went, so...

Okay, let's see.

[Speaker 1]
25... 35... Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I can see the salamander now. Um... And I see the two wolves as well.

Yeah. Not good, I don't think. Um...

Well, I've got a few abilities. Let's see here. Hmm...

Yeah, I can't really do a whole lot, unfortunately. I don't really have a lot of things I can see in range, except for the salamander, so I'm going to hold my action on it if it comes up out of the water. Wait, can I shoot it where it is now?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'd say so. I can?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm going to shoot it then. Think there's a better shot. Okay.

Do-do-do-do-do-do. Um... Do-do-do-do-do-do.

Oof. That seems doubtful. Action hits?

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it definitely hits.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. And if it's still up, then I'll have, um... my wolf wherever I can...

It is. There you are. Um, it's still up, I assume.

And my wolf can... I don't know if it sees... What's his name?

It seems to be out of range, so... He's probably just going to hold his action, and if it comes up out of the water, it's going to chop on him. Or one of these other wolves, if they come close.

Whichever comes first. And that's all I can do, unfortunately.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that brings us to... Oh, that brings us to this guy. He continues sinking.

Maya! Um, I guess I'll chase.

[Speaker 4]
Or I can go vaguely in this direction. So...

[Speaker 7]
I'm going to take the dash action.

[Speaker 4]
There are many of these dogs!

[Speaker 1]
They're just like barking at the edge at the moment.

[Speaker 4]
I found him! Um... I can't kill him, so...

I'm going to shoot him. Fuck this guy. Maya is...

irrational. She'll send three bolts at this guy. Okay.

I miss, and she'll send three more. That's an 18 hit. Unfortunately not.

Across the river, she's peppering the ice. Now that is my turn. Maya is just standing...

He's...

[Speaker 1]
He's dancing like a Russian. Like, with the skates. Like, they cross the arms, and kick the legs up.

Hey! Alrighty. That brings us to...

Frost Salamander. Hey, does this guy have his... breath weapon back?

It's so funny, because if he takes fire damage, I can tell you guys just now, because he's probably going to die this round. Um... But if he gets...

If he gets his breath weapon back, or if he takes fire damage, he gets his breath weapon back, but the only fire damage he took was at the very beginning of the round. That immediately cleared, like, 40 hit points. Alright, Parrot.

He's going to come up through the ice.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Reminds me. A few of these spots of ice are going to disappear. This one freezes back over.

This one freezes back over. That one freezes back over. And that other one will freeze back over next round.

And he's just going to... He's just going to attack. This guy stinks!

Two hits. Alright, so that's 8 and 11 damage.

[Speaker 7]
Up what? Okay. I'm going to quicken a spell.

I'm going to cast a web on the dogs. Can you see this spell? Yeah, you can see it.

Okay, and then I'm going to cast Eldritch Blast.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then I'm going to cast Eldritch Blast. That's good.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, yeah, now I need to select the salamander for an Eldritch Blast.

[Speaker 1]
the salamander for an Eldritch Blast. Uh, you don't have to select them if you don't want to.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Just roll it.

[Speaker 7]
And we have to add 3 to each of those for the hex curse. 29 plus 6. 29 plus 6.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, did you roll to hit? Uh, oh shoot. 21 hits?

Oh, that totally hits. He's dead. I don't think he can survive even the stuff that you already rolled for.

The dog's hair is now hidden by a giant skull. And I think that nets you some hit points as well. I think that nets you some hit points as well.

[Speaker 2]
Does it? Yeah, hexblade curse. Oh, that's right.

[Speaker 1]
That's what Bahamut's there. Okay. That's your turn.

That brings us to Otterstar.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I suppose I'm just gonna move out of the water.

[Speaker 1]
The salamander's floating, so you could probably just run up its, I don't know, belly and onto the ice.

[Speaker 2]
Use it as a flotation device?

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Um, oh jeez. I don't want to deal with the dogs.

[Speaker 4]
If they drown, it's not us that gets cursed.

[Speaker 2]
Well, that one's weird. That one's... well, one of them's weird.

The other one's dang it. I think the one up there, because the water's sealed up, it's under the water now?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this one is basically, um... Dead? He's not coming back.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
So... I guess I'll go here for now.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. And then Mijako is on deck.

[Speaker 5]
Mijako's going to go right around here, hearing the giant thud sounding like a creature falling. Do I... Okay, what's that?

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You're going to have to be a lot more specific.

[Speaker 5]
The reason I can't see anything past those pillar thingies.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, that's a sword, not a pillar that's blocking my sight on the other side. Okay, end of turn now. Anyways, I dashed.

[Speaker 1]
Gotta make me another saving throw, but this guy is...

[Speaker 8]
Me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you. Okay, which one? Dexterity, for all cards that are specified for dashing.

Good. And you? Alright, I need the wolf to make me a deck save.

[Speaker 2]
It's just cold damage, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
It takes some damage, it's immune.

[Speaker 1]
Because it does nothing. Carota, your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, I'm going to go with Eldritch Blast at Manassas.

[Speaker 1]
Do you need to have Blind of Sight on that guy until you hit him?

[Speaker 2]
How can you see him?

[Speaker 5]
I don't see any requirement for...

[Speaker 6]
I mean, other than the Fog of War, I should be able to see him.

[Speaker 5]
And I don't see any requirement for Blind of Sight on this spell.

[Speaker 4]
You can't target a creature you can't see though, can you?

[Speaker 1]
You would have to pick the basically pick the square that he's in, and then it would be at disadvantage.

[Speaker 6]
Is that a friendly wolf there?

[Speaker 2]
That's my wolf. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Fucking weather. This is not what I'm built for.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Um... You could always hold your action if he comes into the lane.

Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I'll hold my Eldritch Blast. That's it for me.

[Speaker 1]
The other hound tries to attack the wolf to no avail. Big mess this is up.

[Speaker 7]
But did the two hounds make their death save throw for being in the web?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they didn't. Instead of using their actions to do that, they tried to attack the wolf, so they're still restrained.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah. Tried to breathe on him, but no, he dies.

I believe... Mijako is the only one that can see Vanessa's...

[Speaker 5]
I can see him, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. Cool. Alright, he's gonna cast...

I'll tell you what, he's gonna cast Entangling Strike. Am I doing this right? Yeah, Entangling Strike, why not?

Wait, no, I don't have Entangling Strike on this list. Sorry. Uh...

What else can I cast? Ooh! Okay.

Mijako's gonna pump you full of arrows. He's gonna attempt to.

[Speaker 4]
That could apply to the Eyes Out damage as well.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
How much did I reduce by doing the saving throw? None. That was just to change your spells.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any resistance to cold damage?

[Speaker 5]
No, but I'm calculating this up.

[Speaker 3]
No, I'm down.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think you're just down.

[Speaker 3]
Did you not get any boots? I thought you had boots. No, I didn't.

Oh, we must have a different character then.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he's gonna continue down. Korona, you can hit him with Roach Blast.

[Speaker 6]
I'm a failure.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I think he's going to attack Robin and... Korona next. He's gonna pop one attack at Korona and two attacks at Robin.

Giddy. Oh yeah, that hits. Alright, 22 damage to Korona.

[Speaker 7]
As a reaction, use Silvery Barbs to take the damage or take the attack away from Korona. Yes. And then I'll give the damage to Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Hm? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, so can you Q-Pop Silvery Barbs in the thing?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. It makes a great roll and then a creature of your choice gets advantage on the next ability check saving throw or attack.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I see. It'll be up in just a second. You'll have to find it.

[Speaker 4]
It has to use the lowest.

[Speaker 1]
It has to use the lowest roll. Okay. Alright, so two attacks versus Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. Oh! Wow, even on a...

That automatically fails because it's a natural one. It's a natural one.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh!

[Speaker 5]
You be a lucky, lucky person!

[Speaker 1]
You are the luckiest man on this. Alright, so that's the end of his turn. Meaning this skates bring him another 20 feet down.

Robin, it is your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you're gonna pay for that. Okay. And I think I have advantage on that first attack.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
That's a fail, I think. And then I will command my wolf to... Is it in the web?

I think it might be. I'm not sure if it is. Actually, I don't think it is.

Yeah, I'm just not sure if it's in the web or not. I don't think I had to make the saving throw, so... Because if it isn't, then it just flies literally over the web.

Oh! Because there's the fly speed.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
And it takes a chomp out of him. And... And unfortunately, that's a swing and a miss.

Uh... I'll... Yeah, I'll back up a little bit.

And that'll be me.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Maya, this guy looks like shit.

[Speaker 4]
I can't see him.

[Speaker 1]
I can't see him. You did see where he went. You saw him go down south.

[Speaker 4]
Dragon will land. Or, like, hover one foot off the ground. I will move in behind.

She will attack with her canine. Non-lethally. First attack to the 17.

I think that's a miss.

[Speaker 1]
Unfortunately.

[Speaker 4]
Second attack. It hits.

[Speaker 2]
Thing's going to use a few strikes to add an extra d6 to that. Is it cold damage? Yes.

I assume he's immune.

[Speaker 1]
He had to go to go. Did Maya use her shadow step before she... Nope, she needs dim light to do the thing.

There's no dim light. Okay. He has one hit point.

[Speaker 4]
Bonus action, flurry of blows. Woo! Going to make two unarmed strikes.

She's going to do two quick kicks. A miss. 17.

We'll do a bit of metagaming. P, field strike, I think lets me add P to up the attack roll.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. You just need to spend three.

[Speaker 4]
Study aim? No.

[Speaker 5]
Can't use study aim, but you get two...

[Speaker 4]
I think there is... Sorry, I need to check. They added it in Tasha's, but it was an extra.

Might not be high enough level for it though.

[Speaker 2]
Um... That's a good question. It's around 4th or 5th level, I think.

I'm not sure.

[Speaker 4]
Focused aim. 5th level. You can spend 1-3 ki points, increasing your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki.

I'll spend 2 ki to increase my attack roll to a 21.

[Speaker 5]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
It deals 7 non-lethal bludgeoning damage, which is magical. Does he go unconscious?

[Speaker 1]
He does go unconscious.

[Speaker 4]
Shackle's on. Now that's an action to put them on. I assume the fight keeps going?

Let's see here. Tel'quah.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. You can run up and put it on. Looks like you got the movement for it.

[Speaker 8]
And then I shackle him. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 8]
You folks are out of initiative.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, not quite. Mijako is still dying.

[Speaker 1]
How long is it going to take you guys to... Let's see here. Alright, Perah.

Would you like to save Mijako before he dies? Do you have any special beef with Mijako?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know, man. Yeah, I'm gonna heal him. Thank you.

I don't know if the amount counts, but that is still max. So that's two extra. Okay.

I mean, if I wanted to be real mean, I could have just spared the dying, but eh.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if Perah wants to carry Mijako.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, probably not. Nah, just push him across the ice. Put him on the ground.

[Speaker 1]
Mijako!

[Speaker 5]
Mijako Haki. Thank you, Perah. Can you lift the dragon?

I'm sorry, what? I was offering you a lift to the dragon.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, I don't need one. It's not my dragon. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I just figured you were out with Maya.

[Speaker 4]
Unwillingly.

[Speaker 5]
Perah was grappled by the dragon.

[Speaker 2]
And dipped on his bow.

[Speaker 5]
But still, we probably should get that lizard thingy out of the water so we can harvest it. I'd like to...

[Speaker 4]
Lift the salamander out of the water, then.

[Speaker 5]
I'll help.

[Speaker 2]
I'm lifelinked to discuss things. And taking his bow. I don't want to get shot again.

[Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1]
That's completely fair.

[Speaker 5]
And let's move the lizard thingy over here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I mentioned his arsehole's gone. Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hey, did the stuff go away?

[Speaker 4]
Oh. I can see all of his dogs.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I took the, uh, whatchamacallit. So the dogs are gonna run back into the woods.

[Speaker 2]
Except for the one that's drowning.

[Speaker 5]
The two that's drowning. No, there's just one that's drowning.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Those two are inside. Yeah.

So we always find those ones, and the other ones.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. So, let's see here. The bow...

Basically what there is to loot on the Avatar is the bow and the skates.

[Speaker 3]
Steal him shoes.

[Speaker 1]
Can't have shit in some aid.

[Speaker 2]
The skates could be useful.

[Speaker 4]
The rupee flippers found themselves on my feet.

[Speaker 1]
Jeez. Alrighty. So, what would you folks like to do?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Oh, hang on one sec.

[Speaker 4]
Maya's happy to give that a crack. She has plus 11 to survival. I think Madison will cut it.

[Speaker 2]
I can help you with the survival fix.

[Speaker 4]
What's your survival bonus?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Plus six. Six.

[Speaker 4]
Advantage is always nice. Maya will spend some time cutting open a salamander. I forgot I roll terribly.

[Speaker 1]
You got a breath, Morgan.

[Speaker 4]
Sick. Nice. Maya doesn't.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I think... I don't know if I should apply here or not.

Recification... Nope, this does not apply.

[Speaker 3]
I suppose we... I would like to do ascending. Is there any important information that we should get to Salile?

Other than having captured him.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, ask what we should do with them now that we've got them manacled. I think.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, now I need to figure out how to actually spell his name.

[Speaker 1]
It's Bay. N-N- A-S-S-U-S.

[Speaker 3]
It is better than the working title of Banussi, so... To Salile.

[Speaker 1]
She'll reply. His avatar will be useful. Yes, you should take him here.

[Speaker 4]
Easy. Get the dragon to carry him. Head back to the spire.

Yep.

[Speaker 7]
How far are we from the spire?

[Speaker 8]
One hex?

[Speaker 4]
Or two, I believe.

[Speaker 2]
It wouldn't be quite a hex.

[Speaker 4]
If we're at the border across the coral.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have too many people for teleporting?

[Speaker 2]
How many can you teleport?

[Speaker 6]
Everybody wants to be a monk.

[Speaker 4]
Eight willing creatures.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think an unconscious person counts as a willing creature.

[Speaker 4]
Maya can ride the dragon back to the spire and carry the man. And the rest of you can teleport. He can't be teleported because he's shackled anyway.

[Speaker 5]
I'll join you to make sure he stays unconscious. You concentrate on steering.

[Speaker 6]
Can I have some monks?

[Speaker 1]
I'm ready. Due to defeating a lord of frost, the frost on the map recedes somewhat.

[Speaker 8]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Winter is not coming.

[Speaker 2]
Winter is leaving.

[Speaker 5]
Winter is going. Winter can go bye-bye. Anyways.

[Speaker 1]
You guys make it back to the spire. I'm going to be back in like two minutes. Okay.

[Speaker 7]
I'm discovering that using the quick bars is very much useful. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Foundry is very user-friendly for automation. Once you get the hang of it.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. When we first started, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the foundry to work correctly. I had no control.

I couldn't upload my character or anything. That took me like 15 minutes to figure out that when I clicked the link, it loaded into Safari instead of...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 7]
Instead of Google Chrome. It's like, why is this not working? Oh my god.

I've only used foundry a few times.

[Speaker 3]
I use Firefox and Opera. Firefox, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Chrome. I usually use Firefox until it stops updating or something. I am back.

[Speaker 8]
We missed you.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. You folks are back at the spire. What would you...

Taliesin and Celile are giddy. They haven't prepared some food in the meantime.

[Speaker 5]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
There's a large banquet table. They instruct you to set Banassus still chained on the end of it.

[Speaker 4]
Banassus can try once a month to break out with a DC 30 strength check. That's not happening.

[Speaker 1]
He's strong, but he's not that strong.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I was worried. Does anybody here have a diplomat's pouch, by the way?

[Speaker 3]
I technically have a diplomat's pouch, but... No, I have ascending, don't I? What did I do with that?

[Speaker 1]
You have ascending stone with dwarf friend, I think it is, right?

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, I think... Did dwarf friend give us one? Oh, maybe he did.

I don't think I put it in my inventory, but I know I got one from the drow lady, which... I think I dropped that one because I did not want to keep that on me.

[Speaker 4]
We can go... If Para wants to quickly duck to the Sierra's keep, we can get Jesse's. He'd be happy to help.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm good for that.

[Speaker 4]
We can just action teleport there and teleport back.

[Speaker 1]
So this is... This is just something that I was like, this will happen if any of you guys are aware of it, so this will happen. If Jesse has a diplomat's pouch, next time you guys see him, he will have this information.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, then...

[Speaker 1]
I will tell you guys now what that is. The folks at the White Orchid Cairn give you ascending to say that Zefain's troops have pulled back from their siege on the Cairn. They don't know why, but with the...

Whatchamacallit, with the retreating troops, they're pledging to... If you'll show them how to set up to reactivate one of those sun shrines and basically fortify it.

[Speaker 4]
Nick, yes, please. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Beforehand, as far as the siege goes, they were losing. They don't know where those guys went.

[Speaker 3]
That'll be something to look into. Why was this happening?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. This happened... This was at the White Orchid Cairn.

So the Elven Cairns can be attacked either in the Overworld, or they can be attacked from the Woad.

[Speaker 4]
That sucks. You've got a different...

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. Yeah, but now that they're no longer being attacked by the Woad, they're like, well, screw it. We need to do something.

Okay, so... Blah, blah, blah. So, Manassas is awake.

Everybody is seated at the banquet table.

[Speaker 4]
What do his ice skates do?

[Speaker 1]
We'll get to that. His bow is pretty simple. It's an extra 2d10 cold damage.

It carries something for a few of the effects of the Swarm Keeper rangers. Oh, neat. And the ice skates are basically really good for moving around on ice.

They can also be used as weapons if you happen to pass somebody by. So Manassas is awake. He looks up at the table.

He looks around at everybody that's gathered around. He looks down at the dimensional shackles and says, Well, this is a pretty... This is a well thought trick.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you, Manassas. I thought about it for a whole half an hour.

[Speaker 1]
There will be consequences for this trick, but... We're here now. He kind of raises an eyebrow, like just waiting.

[Speaker 5]
Um... I'm looking towards the rest... the two...

spay in the group, see where they want to go with this. So shall we sit down and eat?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, let's.

[Speaker 5]
Does he need help eating?

[Speaker 1]
He does need help eating.

[Speaker 3]
Um... I could help him eat. She's going to do it just like you would for a child, like Here comes the airplane!

[Speaker 1]
He doesn't say much. He'll be like in the middle of a sentence trying to make small talk with Taliesin, and he'll just be like, he'll see it from the corner of his eye, and he can go for it. Taliesin and Banessus, until Salil perks up again, are probably just making small talk about Taliesin's disappearance and the circumstances of it.

They haven't spoken in something like 900 years.

[Speaker 4]
I didn't think this far ahead. Now that we have.

[Speaker 1]
He speaks to Salil and says, well, since I'm trapped, since this avatar is trapped here, I can't actually operate in the world or the physical world. And of course you know what this means, don't you? I understand that you're young, but surely you have some understanding of politics.

And Salil says, I'll be ready for whatever comes, and he says, I don't think so. He's of fame, will have by now pulled some of his forces back to assault the Spire in force, seeing as though a small strike team was defending it rather than something like an army. Something that could defeat me, but perhaps was a less equipped to deal with troops.

Of course, I would have called my own troops into battle if another army itself had been present here. And Salil says, you haven't completed your ballad yet. Can't pull any troops.

Sure, I see that you are somewhat well-studied. Or at the very least, someone's been feeding you information that you otherwise wouldn't have heard it through. But true, in fact, it's so important that I complete my ballad that Zephain will, or, sorry, the High Witch King Zephain of Hyborial Court he says somewhat sarcastically, will likely send his troops over from Seydestal and at least one other army, or perhaps even two from the Sungate.

I certainly think it'll be entertaining. I mean, it's been some time since we've seen a Spire of Chorrol arrive, and it will be unfortunate to see it fall so soon, but the High King has plans and he's got it scheduled. Salile does not look happy about this news.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like to incite him.

[Speaker 1]
Other than one of the fibs that you, that Salile apparently caught him in earlier. Can't believe.

[Speaker 3]
Can I also incite?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you may. 20, okay. So it definitely seems like there's little I'm gonna do this one, Aurora's Signature.

It definitely seems like there's a bunch of little fibs coming through like he seems a little less truthful when he mentions three armies coming. It's probably more like two armies coming, but the general thrust of his point is something he appears to be pretty secure in, which is troops will attack the Spire.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we just have to find our own troops.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, how many troops would come?

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. So something that you guys were told or were aware of for Sederstall is that there were about 20 units in Sederstall. Units are usually somewhere between 15 to 30 people apiece.

I think cavalry obviously is basically double that, because there's the mounts and then there's people riding them. So there would be 20 units coming from Sederstall, so somewhere between 300 to 400 people, plus maybe some mounts. And then coming from...

I think he's not going to give you a straight answer on what would be coming from the gate, but based off Perra's insight check, you can probably gather that at least another 10 units are coming from the ice between the Spires.

[Speaker 8]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 5]
About how long do you figure it'll take them to march and assemble?

[Speaker 1]
Well, armies do take some time to get on the move. I don't know. You know what?

You probably have at least a good three weeks. Don't be concerned. That's plenty of time for me to prepare.

[Speaker 4]
What do you think the best course of action is for us to prepare for this? Other than rallying troops, of course.

[Speaker 1]
Who are you asking? You're asking Banessus?

[Speaker 4]
No, no.

[Speaker 1]
Taliesin or Solail. Taliesin says, you know what? There's probably just nothing to be done.

We should probably all just give up. And he and Banessus laugh in unison while Solail looks on a little bit horrified, kind of getting the joke. He's like, no, no.

After dinner I'll tell you. And the rest of dinner probably goes quite pleasantly. Just more small talk from Banessus.

Especially just Taliesin asking him what new kills he's gotten in the past 900 years.

[Speaker 3]
Hera wants to ask if she can have one of his dogs.

[Speaker 1]
You know what? I actually modeled it. Or attempted to model it off the draconic spirits.

I think that one of them might take you. Listen, if you captured one, one of them might take you quite nicely. My recommendation is to make your own collar though.

I'll try to re-enchant one of mine.

[Speaker 3]
That's fair. I want one that's cuter anyway.

[Speaker 1]
Best of luck.

[Speaker 4]
I can't think of anything else I have for now.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. So after dinner, Taliesin will bring you folks into a side room. He says, alright, here's the deal.

Do you folks never open the massive door in the dining hall?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think we did. Did we even go into the dining hall?

[Speaker 1]
The dining hall is basically the grand chamber that you guys initially found altogether. It's now being used as a dining hall. We only went through the treasure rooms, really.

But that door is open, and he tells you. It is a gate. Whoa.

Here's the key. I think we need two things. First one is I never commanded troops myself.

I have some cherubium that I can command if I happen to complete my ballad. But the most warlike among us would have been the most warlike, yes, it would have been Valyria. I imagine she is still somewhere nearby.

There's a gate of hers to the world what was referred to as the nesting gate that would lead to her domain. If he took that in there, you would be able to field troops if you were to help her, if you were to convince her.

[Speaker 5]
One hand helps the other situation. We help her. She'll help us, maybe.

[Speaker 1]
She's struggling under the same thing that pretty much all of us are at the moment, which is we haven't completed our ballads.

[Speaker 5]
So if we help her complete her ballad, that would be a nice incentive to help us out in this situation.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing I would recommend you folks do, especially given that you have the mantle of midnight, you would be able to, and I can see that you've been using it to great effect, if you were to use that to transport troops here, we would stand a rather significant shot at destroying many of Sephades. If he speaks the truth and it's three armies, I don't see this any reason why you couldn't raise three armies' worth, especially if you had enough gold and enough alliances.

[Speaker 3]
That's certainly something I'm going to be working on. That's something we can do.

[Speaker 5]
Excellent. Excellent. Out of character, that White Orchard Karen said if we show them how to turn on a sunshine nearby them, they'd possibly loan us some support in this struggle.

[Speaker 4]
We haven't got that message yet, but I think that was the case. Well, they would defend them, is what they said. They'd defend the sunshine.

They would defend one of them. Which is helpful.

[Speaker 5]
It would be. I just wanted to rehear the exact terms that he had given. That's all I can think of.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing that I recommend you folks could do, and I could find you a gate to perform this, is I'd still recommend talking with Tanadan of the Silver Falls. How do you spell their name? It's like Autumn, but...

[Speaker 3]
Ten of them.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
Where is the Silver Falls?

[Speaker 1]
Way on the left side of the map. Nobody has yet ventured. It's a little clover symbol.

[Speaker 5]
I see. Oh, the one right here? Whee!

Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You guys got an idea of what to do in downtime this next week?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, we now got I think three missions possible. Talk to the lady here. Help with the ballad of that one in the wood.

The bird one. And I'm trying to... Oh yeah, and help with the orchard.

[Speaker 1]
So just to give you guys a reference for the upcoming troop prices that are going to drop in the next week or so. Probably the next two days. The troop prices broadly speaking are about $600 to $2,000.

$600 at the low end and about $2,000 at the very high end. To recruit them from any of the areas that you have contacts or under your control. Go ahead.

[Speaker 3]
So low end, high end, that's for like one set of troops?

[Speaker 1]
Right. Now there are modifiers that apply to this. Like if you hire them from a settlement, like a keep for instance, that goes down.

There are both recruitment and upkeep reductions to that price. I think up to either 30% or 50%. At the moment, I think gold is no object for you folks.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a little bit of a dragon over here.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair.

[Speaker 3]
Speak for yourselves.

[Speaker 1]
Speak for yourself.

[Speaker 3]
I'm good to probably hire my own set of troops. I don't think I would be very good at running them, but if anyone thinks they can run troops, I am willing to sponsor them, I suppose. Any of my three are willing to be...

[Speaker 5]
You'd be the general or what title would you give me?

[Speaker 3]
Colonel, you know, whatever. Oh, that's the thing, I don't know jackdids about anything that relates to troops. Okay, you're marshal, I'll be general.

[Speaker 5]
Sound good?

[Speaker 3]
We will see when the thing comes out. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
I am going the fuck to sleep. Good sessions, everybody. That was five hours.

[Speaker 3]
Thanks for running.

[Speaker 5]
Before we head off to bed, what's the XP like for this session?

[Speaker 1]
I have yet to fully calculate it. Yeah, James.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, math might be an issue there, so we'll see it in a little while, I suppose.

[Speaker 3]
And for my dragon, do you want me to build it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if possible. I could also actually, you know what, you have your own folder now, which took me way too long to get. I went through and I got all the defunct character sheets and dropped them into...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I still have access to a lot of those.

[Speaker 1]
Still have no idea.

[Speaker 3]
I have access to Telqua. I have access to Jaster's folder because there's a white dragon in there. And then I see the defunct because I have access to their little guys.

[Speaker 1]
Right, from like Sona and Guru, I think it was.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, they're servants. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Do I just put the defunct sheets I have for the hirelings into the defunct section?

[Speaker 1]
No. Okay, I'll probably delete them at some point.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. If you just give me Jacko a folder to delete. James, how do I...

With Jesse's downtime, I need to negotiate the other 10 buyers or kill them. One of the two. I'm going to try negotiating with them at first.

Would that be like diplomacy? I could do it through face-to-face. I need to do like 10 of these.

[Speaker 1]
And diplomacy is a pretty good option for it.

[Speaker 4]
Jesse would essentially be trying to convince them to pay what they're worth. And he isn't trying to undercut them or do them dirty. It's a genuine product.

He thinks it's worth 8 grand per horn and that they should pay it and that we're not going to have a deal if they don't. So it would be like... And then for the role it would just be like a persuasion or something charisma based for Jesse, wouldn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, pretty much. What if we could use those to get troops? In fact, that is the primary purpose of those.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, diplomacy is for like inter city settlement relationships and things like that. Negotiating troops.

[Speaker 3]
I might get using the horns to get troops.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. Probably. Not everybody was killed when those mercenary companies down south got attacked by something.

By a horrific fucking sea monster in the middle of a storm that you guys caused. That was great.

[Speaker 3]
And is buying things a downtime action or is buying things something I can do on top of a downtime action?

[Speaker 4]
Buying things is something that you can just do. Unless it's 5,000 gold diamonds.

[Speaker 3]
Because I want to find those doggles. But I can do that later, now that I know I can actually just downtime it.

[Speaker 4]
Jesse will use some minstrel dice to get his persuasion check to a 32 to try and get these people to pay their proper pricing for the unicorn horns. And if anyone doesn't respect that, he isn't going to sell to them, I think. Lost 10 buyers, James.

[Speaker 1]
I think what you do is you'll gain five buyers will walk, but another five will pay the full price.

[Speaker 4]
What's that then? Five times 8,000 is 40 grand. That would be...

What cut did I give the others last time? I need to calculate that.

[Speaker 7]
I'm taking off. Thank you, everybody.

[Speaker 4]
Nice playing with you.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. See you later, buddy. Let's hear it.

You and Yo-Yo. Very good job on your first session. I was really freaked out.

I was like, oh, man, I'm going to kill two people's characters in their first session.

[Speaker 3]
We actually did really good in general on that. I still have a lot of resources, and I was expecting to get tapped.

[Speaker 1]
I was thinking about doing it because there were a bunch of other monsters on the map you guys didn't encounter. Depending on which way they... Do they make a beeline?

Do they stealth first? And you guys basically stealth every single time, which saved you a hell of a lot of hit points and resources.

[Speaker 7]
Pass without Trace for the win. Absolutely.

[Speaker 4]
Such a good spell.

[Speaker 2]
Now we double up because I've got as well.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Until you had joined us, we actually had trouble sneaking about and stuff, so that's why I made Maya so we could pass without Trace, and now it's just good having it from several sides.

[Speaker 2]
Cool.

[Speaker 7]
All right. See you next time.

[Speaker 2]
I don't really have any downtime anything to do, I don't. I think.

[Speaker 3]
I'll just catch you next week and we'll see how we get We usually do downtime in the downtime thread, which is attached to the Samheed Boogaloo, and that's just done over the week. I just had a couple questions that I wanted to get out before I forgot, because I have an interview on Monday.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh.

[Speaker 2]
How's this thread connected to another thread? I don't see how this...

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I don't see it. I'll tag you to it.

I'll tag you in the thing. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
If there's other threads that I don't know of, then why do you go... Anyway, I'll see what there is I can do. I don't think there's much there.

No money and no power, so.

[Speaker 1]
Believe it or not, let's see here. This being associated with powerful people is usually a pretty good excuse to get some stuff going, so don't be afraid to, especially if you're acting as an emissary of somebody who's in power.

[Speaker 2]
I'll think about who that is. I don't know enough about the lore to know whether or not my character does or not.

[Speaker 4]
No worries. Any of my characters can help you out with money, really, is what James is saying. Yeah.

I can bankroll a lot of stuff that's going on.

[Speaker 3]
I have almost broken 30,000.

[Speaker 2]
Jesus.

[Speaker 3]
You know. I'm spending most of it on troops when that comes down. Hopefully.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. But at least I have a decent bow now. So, yeah.

That's nice.

[Speaker 1]
No, I was thinking of this stuff because you're trick working, right? Yes, you're saying. This will basically add a slightly favorite skin, but this will basically add the Swarm Keeper's class features on top of your current abilities.

[Speaker 2]
That's pretty good, yeah. Swarm Keeper's not too bad.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, folks. I'm gonna hop off.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. I'll catch you next week then, probably.

[Speaker 3]
Night.

[Speaker 2]
Take care, then. Peace.

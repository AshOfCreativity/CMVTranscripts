[Speaker 5]
I'm going to finally play my Autisipho and make magic items, finally.

[Speaker 1]
I thought you were going to say autism. I really thought you were going to say autism. I just...

[Speaker 5]
Autisipho.

[Speaker 1]
I am artistic with a soft R.

[Speaker 6]
Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Getting a little dangerous. Virtual camera has been starting. There we go.

Okay, I'm going to heat up my coffee, which has already been made. I am slightly more prepared for this fine evening. And then, yes.

Yes, let me know what it is that you're going to... How you're going to take that approach there. Like, what you're going to...

Are you bringing the druid or are you bringing the wizard?

[Speaker 4]
Well, going to bring the druid, because the magic items... I was probably just going to go for a Staff of Dunamancy. Yeah, very rare item.

And go from there. But, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, so that was not an answer?

[Speaker 4]
I am bringing the druid, because you mentioned him being at risk.

[Speaker 1]
Because I mentioned the druid being at risk. Yeah, I'm totally fine with that. Alrighty.

So, what is the plan? Oh, sorry. Okay, so Professor Dickory is going to...

The gnomish Professor Dickory has been tracking a number of resident seeds across the Maid. He is going to use one that he's transported up to a location along the river. Has not been named.

[Speaker 6]
Four, twelve, twenty-four.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, I should put a new one down. Yes. Yes, we will do that.

Okay. Let me see if I can get this node on the map. Alright.

This will be on the southern end of Loch Bonner House. It's older.

[Speaker 4]
And you mentioned that the people who departed from the dragon hut half HP and half hit dice? Or has that changed? That is quite correct.

Ah. Okay, so it is not... So, no recovery.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
It's been eight days, so you get like a hit die back. And... You can spend...

If you wanted to spend hit dice in pursuit of recovery there, you could as well.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Yeah, sure.

[Speaker 1]
There, you should see a windmill. Okay, now I'm actually going to go and get my gold. Where you said I was.

Can somebody tag Popo? Mr. Popo. On it, boss.

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 5]
Hey, Mr. Popo. He's still biting. I just get like that when I'm hungry.

[Speaker 4]
Like that. I just now realized my headset was disconnected for a while there.

[Speaker 5]
It's out, doobie, sometime.

[Speaker 1]
I'll figure something out. I'm thinking like either Ink's Lake or Marble Falls. Or Dallas.

Because it's been too fucking long. You want to go back up to Dallas? The place we were just at?

[Speaker 6]
Two days ago.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome. Awesome, maybe. Really?

Yeah, but there's like pretty, uh...

[Speaker 2]
Around Austin, sure, there's not...

[Speaker 1]
No, no, we don't go to the fucking city. I don't know the people there. There's those people who I was calling, um...

Those YouTubers who I was calling Ginger Frazer and, uh... See the sloth? They live there.

Those people I was... Who's in personal appearance I was insulting over their RPG opinions. They live there.

They'd be happy to see me. Anyways. Right, have we secured a full house?

It appears as though we have. Oh, hey, Mr. Popo!

[Speaker 5]
I feel like there was...

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, go ahead, Landy.

[Speaker 5]
I feel like there was someone... Interested... Oh, no.

Must have been imagining.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, it was, uh... It was Dallas, but they were only going to be able to play for two hours. Oh, I see.

So, I understand.

[Speaker 5]
James, why is there a Spooky Wizard token below my Wolfclaw Keep token?

[Speaker 1]
Spooky Wizard token beneath Wolfclaw Keep?

[Speaker 5]
Is that a player or is that a faction?

[Speaker 1]
That's a good question. Alfred Weiss... I mean, that seems like it would be the...

Huh. Zero... Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's owned by the Glass Mages.

[Speaker 5]
They've just repoed my castle!

[Speaker 1]
Well, they did initially. Oh, that's right. I should tell those guys.

They were asking a lot of questions about, um... Hey, what should I do if I go to one faction or another? What should I...

Do this? There's a procedure. They could just use the encounter reactions in ADD...

To determine, like... Oh, shit, like, are we... Alright, well, we're the same people and we speak the same language.

So we're going to have these bonuses. And besides that, it's down to the dice. That's how it goes there.

I'll tell them that. I'll let them know. All good.

I wasn't really able to do the turn three factions, but that's okay. Because that was mostly players. And General Cazador, I'll have him submit orders.

Because he's just going to start tearing across that lower map there.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, there's no one there to worry about that for now. Defenseless villagers, mostly.

[Speaker 2]
We tried. Tried our best.

[Speaker 1]
Now that's something that nobody's encountered. Well, here's the thing. Now Pyphus's goons are down there.

That segment of the map. There's one mage college. There's two centaur tribes.

There are two elf cairns. And...

[Speaker 2]
Can you do... We tried.

[Speaker 1]
And there is Morellon. Besides that, it's just a fuckton of smaller villages. They're unnamed, dotted in between.

But... Okay, Mr. Popo. Would you like to introduce yourself?

The evening mic check. No pressure. I don't know if they can actually...

[Speaker 2]
Can you imagine he's scrambling right now?

[Speaker 1]
Trying to get the mic to work. Shit, shit, shit, shit. I know how that goes.

[Speaker 4]
And... And it probably turns out... Oh, they have push-to-talk enabled.

[Speaker 1]
But they forgot the key. They forgot the key. Fumbling for my keys as the...

I don't know, the mugger is behind me trying to get access to my Discord.

[Speaker 2]
He's literally following you home.

[Speaker 1]
He's like, what was the key behind for that? Okay, so while we're waiting for... While we're waiting for Mr. Popo, I'm going to give everybody a brief recap on, well, not really the previous sessions. Yeah, a little bit of the previous sessions. So, people were going through the Yzrigan. We had, like, two separate parties in the area going back and forth between the Yzrigan itself, the excavation site, and the surrounding areas there.

And a dragon's nest that was quite nearby so that people could go fight the dragon that chose to leave them alone while they were out flying about. And this went poorly. It did not result in...

It did not result in, like, financial success or adventuring success or anything like that. It mostly just ended up with people losing a lot of hit points, which was fine because it was funny. And otherwise, kind of just, like, sputtering, stumbling around, getting a little bit of gold, which is always nice.

I'm happy when the players get gold. But, yeah, besides that...

[Speaker 2]
Are we talking about the dragon attack?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. No, you guys attacked the dragon. Or trying to attack the dragon.

[Speaker 2]
It was a shitstorm.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No, people... Well, it was a hurricane that you were going into.

You guys turned it into a shitstorm. It wasn't even necessarily a shitstorm, just like a... Just an annoying number of times I had to remind people there's...

It's a hole. It's a hole in the ground. It's a hole in the ground.

You can't just... It's a hole in the... It's a hole in the ground.

You cannot walk to the dragon lair. It's a hole in the ground. There's a place in the hole that is not a hole, but it's in the center.

And between you guys on the outside of the hole and him on the center of the hole is a hole. It's a hole in the ground. So you cannot walk there.

At last, my cries fell on not listening ears. But... It's okay.

These people eventually ended up teleporting. One group ended up going back to the Ysrigan to do something. I guess to, like, just avoid the dragon and kind of hang out with...

Just to see what was going on, I guess. And they got attacked by the dragon on the way. The mages that were there for the tower defense were doing pretty well, mostly because the previous players had actually, one, they captured the...

They still don't have his name. He's just listed as Perv Wizard because of all the prostitutes that were mentioned. And then, what was it?

Yeah, you had Perv Wizard, who was dominated by the existing wizard, and people were able to make friends with the owner of the tower this time. So that just happened to work out really nicely.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, last time it didn't go so well. For him, anyway.

[Speaker 1]
For him, exactly, yeah. You know, nothing wrong with that. But...

So that all gets resolved. People are heading back to... They're getting teleported out by the Thalazar, the owner of the tower...

Yeah, the wizard owner of the tower that we mentioned beforehand, or by Pera, or by Lucent's Pyramid. There are plenty of different options there. Yeah.

Yeah, so that all happened. The players were... Yeah.

They did some dungeon crawling or city crawling in Asheros last night, which I believe ended with... Well, it ended with Pera getting... Not Pera, sorry.

It ended with Mosa getting kidnapped, and then Gucci getting recovered immediately.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so is that going to be resolved, or do we have to make a session?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know how you guys finished it. If you guys were able to cast a gate spell, then you're Gucci. You're fine.

We have one person who has reached 17th level, and actually more recently reached 18th level, and is helping carry the various parties in a good way, not in like a, oh, these other people are doing no work. No, just in the way that people are working together in a way that's really positive and encouraging, and I think has made the campaign a lot more fun overall. You guys have your very own Gandalf, except it's a tiny kobold cleric who received an overpowered artifact that only gets stronger if you're like, hey, let's give this to the new person.

Oh, wow, that worked out really well for everybody, actually. That's a sequence of words I usually only string together when I'm being sarcastic, but the case is done. No, fuck it, it was awesome.

Has Mr. Popo said anything inside the...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm here. I had to change my voice and the audio settings. I wasn't able to hear the first half of what you said, but I caught up.

[Speaker 1]
Gotcha, gotcha.

[Speaker 5]
At least it's fixed now. Yes, we're good.

[Speaker 3]
I saw the green boxes around everyone's portrait and I was like, oh, there's an issue here.

[Speaker 6]
I don't hear any voices.

[Speaker 5]
Whereabouts is Professor Dickery, because that's who I was thinking of going from.

[Speaker 1]
So he's located at the Dickery docks, which is something I made up 10 minutes ago because I wasn't going to resist. Really, that's the only reason he hasn't been placed on the map as of yet, is because I had to come up with something sufficiently stupid to call this location. But yeah, so he has a little research lab set up on the south end of Lake Bonner House where he is less likely to ruin everybody's good time.

The little windmill icon at the bottom of the lake in the center. Mr. Propo, have you had an okay time logging in?

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, I'm good. All right, perfect, perfect.

[Speaker 1]
There's a beagle lake in the center of Lake Bonner House, and there's a, let's see, towards the bottom of that lake, a windmill icon. If you hover over it, it says Dickery docks. So that's where our gentleman is.

[Speaker 6]
Here we go. Perfect, perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, excellent. Yeah, so he's going to collect the party there from the, let's see here, Mr. Propo, would you introduce your, actually, no, I should describe the scene first, because this will help give you a little bit of context, I think, for handling the rest of this. So the party will find themselves right next to these docks in which a wizard tower slash artificer's laboratory has been set up.

There's a lot of different materials that come in from the trading vessels that go up and down the river that's kind of central to the valley here. It's their version, like I said, tell all new people, it's their version of the Mississippi River. Yeah, so he's been able to put himself to good work along with his assistants when you look at the area, you find that there are two resonant seeds, and I'll describe those for those who haven't been there in a moment.

There are two resonant seeds, or at least pieces of smaller ones. Think of a big one as being a liver, then these would be more kind of lymph nodes that have been partially disassembled in the area and then hooked onto different pieces of the tower and laboratory, respectively. Now, let's see here.

He's going to welcome everybody. Ah, yes, yes, yes. Okay, it's a good thing that everyone got my instructions here, even some of them who I wasn't expecting.

He's a small gnome, balding, but not quite bald. He's just got kind of like this very stringy, how do I say this, like kind of spandex, like, yeah, European, Portuguese kind of like male pattern baldness that's white, stringy, and curly on top of his head that's usually covered by a hat, but otherwise looking healthy and sprit. Sprit?

Spry is what I meant to say. It's like I mistyped on my computer by using my mouse. Let's see here.

And now is everybody's opportunity to introduce themselves and their characters.

[Speaker 5]
I will start off. My character is a small gnome-sized robot with a porcelain face and fake mustache and beard. He is a construct.

Clearly he has robotic features and his armor itself is swirling and glowing and all sorts of effects coming off it as it's clearly working a bit overtime to just be powered up. I am Upgrade, the auto-gym at your service.

[Speaker 2]
I've never seen someone play that race before.

[Speaker 5]
It is definitely something Sarah's from Memphis.

[Speaker 2]
I'm bringing Peevee. She's a barbarian fighter leonin. There's a lot going on in her mind.

That's kind of the problem. She's not very smart. It's not her fault, though.

She's an ancestral barbarian. So that's going on.

[Speaker 3]
I'll go next. I am running with my first character, Fremen. He's a barbarian rogue.

He is a jacked-looking humanoid with wolf-like features, a mane and a big bushy beard. He basically walks around. He's kind of like Wolverine would be the best way I could describe him.

He walks around with just pants on, no shirt. He's tattooed all over his upper body, completely ripped. He's got a couple of scimitars hanging from his side.

He wears a funny-looking hat as he walks around. He always kind of has this funky little grin hanging on his face.

[Speaker 2]
What race is he?

[Speaker 3]
He is a shifter.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Very nice.

[Speaker 4]
I am bringing Rowan, my druid, my hexblood druid. You'll notice, as he comes in, he actually has scorch marks on his robes and armor and all that. And a distinct smell of ozone.

Not really, like he's just departed a very intense storm.

[Speaker 2]
Is that the one we were running for our lives from?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That's Phoebe and Rowan are coming here with half equivalents and half dice.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah, and I used... He's like all fucked up.

[Speaker 4]
Like if you look closely at some of Rowan's hair, you can see occasionally it just like... It's like electrified. Phoebe's hair is poofy.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
She looks way bigger than she is.

[Speaker 1]
Every time we bring Phoebe, there's something that has to do with lagging. I don't know if we've ever had an exception, which is, to me, hilarious.

[Speaker 4]
And alongside all that, you might be able to hear the faint buzz of spores. Spore druid, remember?

[Speaker 2]
Right. Been too many damn spore stuff. It just hasn't gone our way.

[Speaker 1]
It was fine. Nobody died.

[Speaker 2]
It didn't feel fine.

[Speaker 1]
No one had an issue. Nothing at all. Well, an auto-gym.

This is quite interesting. I believe that... Has the Eyeless Cult been so interested in my work here?

[Speaker 5]
I am currently lost.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. How did you get lost?

[Speaker 5]
Undefined.

[Speaker 1]
Were you looking for something?

[Speaker 5]
I am here to help. Interesting. Very interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Phoebe is going to just kind of flick the side of your arm or something.

[Speaker 5]
Clank.

[Speaker 2]
If that fixes whatever is going on.

[Speaker 5]
It does not fix. He doesn't even respond to it, really.

[Speaker 1]
There we go. Yes, well, please. Come in.

Come in. I assume... I don't know how much talking you all want to do if you want to do any resting beforehand, but I do wish to discuss just the general purpose of your being here today.

Excellent. Now, which of you have some magical ability among you? Well, naturally, as a druid, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Good, good.

[Speaker 5]
I am also magical by nature.

[Speaker 3]
I can speak with animals.

[Speaker 1]
Speaking with animals. Okay, that's not quite what I had in mind, but certainly not going to hurt.

[Speaker 3]
You have an understanding. Indeed.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Well, what I'm expecting at this point is for our illustrious workers here... who assist me with a teleportation attempt.

I've located what I think will be another facility that's involved with the resident series. And should we take advantage of this? Well, besides the great deal of money we could make, what I'm primarily interested in is all the lost technology that used to keep this very land afloat in the air.

Kind of fascinating. Plus we'll be able to use whatever resident seed we find. I don't know if any of you have used its properties before.

Kibi? I don't know if you have. If you have, I've seen you around Wolfclaw Keep, but I don't know how well acquainted you are with everyone there.

[Speaker 2]
Has Kibi used what?

[Speaker 1]
A resident seed. Among its other benefits, people can use it to... People can actually use it to fix or change pieces of themselves, qualities of themselves that they wish adjusted or altered.

As if certain things had never happened to them before. I don't quite know what the limits are.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi is not familiar.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I see. It must have been another...

[Speaker 2]
And if she is, she isn't right now. No, I gotcha.

[Speaker 1]
I think it might have been Charis might have gone on that mission. I can't think of anybody else. Yes.

So we're going to engage a teleportation attempt, and then we're going to get going. Does anybody need to sleep, rest, do anything in preparation for our journey here before we get going? Well, that would be quite helpful.

It would be prudent of all of you, especially if you have anything to prepare.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I'm going to path up some sleep. Find a nice warm spot on the ground and just turn my back to everyone and fall asleep.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Rowan is going to grab that chance to actually get some proper recovery that's not been on the road hunted by a dragon. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That would cause you guys some problems over time. Okay. So you guys will be able to rest and go to sleep.

Rowan, you were about to ask a question?

[Speaker 4]
No, I was just commenting on the fact that, oh yeah, as a druid, classic nemesis, dragon. Indeed. This probably could be Rowan's stealth.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a chance I could get more javelins?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes indeed. In fact, that's the last thing that we should probably discuss. But last on my list, at the very least, is rewards.

Of course, I wouldn't expect you to do this without payment.

[Speaker 3]
Remanzir's perk up and he sits up from his laying down position. Ah, gifts? Someone was talking about something?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, indeed.

[Speaker 5]
What a gem packs up. I require crafting materials.

[Speaker 1]
Now this would be easy to get for you. Excellent.

[Speaker 4]
So before Rowan has a sleep, he's just going to use aura vitality on himself. Not a bad idea. No, it'd be more efficient to just do healing word on himself.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, so I was thinking about a thousand gold for a person. So roughly the value, based on how many of you there are, is roughly how valuable this is to me. There is the use of the resident seeds, which would have...

The key use of the resident seeds is that you can use them to change some element of either yourself or a magic item you have acquired. A little bit less predictable, but I've had some success trying to change the type of enchantment that was applied to a magic item in retroactively. Almost like retconning it.

If you were to write a novel and then decide later on you disliked a story element, you could go back and adjust it. I find it quite handy. No major issues so far.

I turned a flame tongue into a frostbrand. Mr. Autogym, you mentioned that you were looking for materials, yes?

[Speaker 5]
I wish to craft.

[Speaker 1]
Of course, of course. In fact, I would actually let you make... As long as you made it back here, I would let you use our lab if you wished.

[Speaker 5]
Excellent.

[Speaker 1]
We'll see if we can make things a little bit more expedient. And for the rest of you, let's see here. Miss Hebe, anything that you desire?

[Speaker 2]
Hebe just wants javelins.

[Speaker 1]
I see, I see. Well, I wish to be as safe as possible here, so... If you like javelins, I have two javelins of lightning that I would prefer someone with a strong arm to control.

At the very least for this mission, we could entrust them to your care.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, please.

[Speaker 1]
Good, very good. And what of this... I'm so sorry, you with the fuzzy hair, I've forgotten your name.

Rowan. No, the other one.

[Speaker 3]
The other fuzzy head.

[Speaker 1]
The fuzzy hair that's well maintained.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, thank you, yes, I do like to keep well groomed. Fremen is the name.

[Speaker 1]
Fremen, very well. Yes, is there anything specific that you're looking for?

[Speaker 3]
No, nothing specific. I leave that up to your imagination. Whatever you deem fitting for the trials that you see we'll be getting into.

Anything that might aid us, I'm more than willing to take advantage of your gifts.

[Speaker 1]
Tell you what, I have a few beads of force here. If you would like to keep these on your person.

[Speaker 3]
You never know when they'll become handy. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
And then the rest of you... How should I do this? So Rowan, you have...

Interesting, I was really expecting someone of your sort to come here, but...

[Speaker 4]
I'll have to get the resources to go for my goals, after all.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, I suppose that will be fine. Just so you know, your scimitar at the moment is like, Yes, yes, we will destroy the resident seed. Preferably we will kill all of them.

[Speaker 4]
Just like, Rowan is just staring blankly at his sickle.

[Speaker 1]
He just sighs. I sense trepidation, why do you wish to hesitate? Are you in a low state?

[Speaker 4]
The staff, the sickle is saying that. Well, I did get hunted for that.

[Speaker 1]
Your wound is dragging you down, I understand. I understand, nature does need time to recover. If worse comes to worse, you could use the seed to...

As a final insult to the bit of technology that's polluted this land for so long, I believe that you could use this seed to actually bring yourself to restore your prior health. We shall do this before destroying it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh well.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, Rowan is just going to carry on. Very good. Okay, so let's see here.

Kibi and Fremen. You guys know how to actually... Well Fremen, we'll start with you.

I think Kibi knows how to use plutonium import.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I already have the beat of force in my inventory, I just need to know how many. Excellent, it's four. Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
I also know.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent, excellent. And are you able to put in your javelins of lightning there?

[Speaker 2]
Yep, you said two of them?

[Speaker 3]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, perfect. We are good to go.

[Speaker 3]
We are set.

[Speaker 1]
Good, good. I can't think of anything else that's terribly important right now. That's fine.

You guys will rest. Does anybody... There are four bedrooms available here.

You guys are obviously able to stay apart from each other. Does anybody do any kind of... What's everybody's reactions to the other people inside the party here?

Fremen, what's your first impressions of your new compatriots?

[Speaker 3]
He's a pretty easy going guy. He's just along for the ride. I like it.

[Speaker 1]
How is the auto-tune?

[Speaker 3]
No feelings one way or the other, at this point in time. Right, nothing to... Tip the scale, so to speak.

[Speaker 5]
Statistically, Upgrade thinks he is a superior construct to the humanoid, but he will not let that influence him too much.

[Speaker 1]
He's all business.

[Speaker 2]
You get poked a little bit throughout the night, I guess.

[Speaker 5]
You can try and hit my AC if you'd like.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, not like a malicious poke, just like a very curious kind of like, does this thing do, does it have any...

[Speaker 5]
He is very heated up. He has a metal shield as well, when everything's equipped, I have 24 AC.

[Speaker 2]
Jesus. Damn, nice. Very nice.

I like to imagine he has a coin slot for when he's paying for things, he just slides all the coins out.

[Speaker 5]
He does now, thank you. Shoots coins out of the lightning launcher.

[Speaker 4]
Back to Sekiro, I think. Railgun, kid. Railgun.

[Speaker 3]
Amazing.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Okay, so the next day comes out, and Mr. Dickory is getting prepared to... Professor Dickory is getting prepared to...

He kind of takes you guys into the lower levels of his basement, the laboratory here, and says, all right, what you're about to see is going to look a little strange, a little odd, I promise you, it's perfectly, well, I'm not going to say natural, but I do think it's a marvel of technology, and I've been quite frankly blessed to see it. You see a resonant seed here that's been adjusted in a few different ways. It's definitely been altered in terms of its shape, or maybe it was always this way, it's hard to tell.

Pieces of a seed in the shape of a human face that have been spread out almost in like a hex flower to reveal all of the machinery and cording within. That reminds me, some of you have not actually seen a resonant seed before, and I forgot to describe it visually. It's a mass of basically computer circuitry with these very thin wires kind of threaded all over it.

It's usually a mix of blue and red hues over kind of like bluish, like a teal anodized, or yeah, like a teal covered gray. It has a teal luster over like shiny gray metal.

[Speaker 3]
Interesting.

[Speaker 2]
I like the implications.

[Speaker 3]
It looks fancy.

[Speaker 1]
So, it is, Professor Dickory walks up and says, What I'm hoping is that this will take us to where this was originally manufactured. Will it teleportation? I think that it's going to go, let's see here, over everything here.

Now, normally when it comes to teleporting these objects, it's actually quite risky business, but we're in luck when it comes to this thing, because we're doing it, what we're connecting to is kind of like the home signal, the home circuit. So, the normal risk of teleportation, where you might end up somewhere completely different, are null here. At this point, I need everybody to make me a perception check.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see, how am I with perception?

[Speaker 4]
Got a 15.

[Speaker 1]
All right, who else got above a 15? Jim.

[Speaker 2]
I think everybody did but Keebee. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Very unfortunate. Yeah, so, those of you who got a 15 or higher, hear a, you know, just a lot of noise coming from upstairs. It just sounds like a lot of commotion.

[Speaker 3]
Any particular kind of noise?

[Speaker 1]
It sounds like a place going, it kind of sounds like the morning, the breakfast rush in the morning.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, food, I will head straight up there. My belly is rumbling. I had a full night and I am hungry.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, well, we already finished, we already finished up breakfast.

[Speaker 3]
I saw you eating earlier. But don't you have second course breakfast?

[Speaker 1]
Well, we do sometimes, but I don't like to work on a full stomach. Keeps the, you know, keeps the proper dopamine rush away from, you know, a good hearty discovery. I don't want to ruin it with a meal.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee disagrees.

[Speaker 3]
Agree to disagree. I concur, Keebee.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yes, so he continues his preparations here. I want everybody to make me another perception check.

[Speaker 4]
25. Wow, we killed them all.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee got this, believe in me.

[Speaker 1]
Heyo. Hot dog. All right, tell me who got above a 10 and who got above a 20.

I got above a 10.

[Speaker 2]
I think we all got above a 20.

[Speaker 1]
No, I rolled an 18.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
All right, everybody except Fremen, sorry, so you guys hear like another loud commotion like right outside the door? Like somebody started getting a, like somebody pushed a cart over or into something, a little bit of breaking glass and such.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee's going to march over there.

[Speaker 1]
And then briefly, hold on just a second, then it sounds like somebody apologizing. Like, oh shit, sorry, I'm sorry, didn't mean to do that. But those of you who got above a 20 can hear a faint crying sound beneath this, basically behind this one.

[Speaker 2]
Intriguing. That's where I must go.

[Speaker 3]
Sounds like someone dropped food. Maybe we should help.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, Rowan's going to look quizzically at the sound of crying, and then he's going to follow Keebee.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I'm just going to create a short, kind of simple battle map here. Actually, what I think I have is, no, here's what I'll do, I'll use this one for the, I'm going to create one that I just use for the hallway here, and then I got, if we need the other one that I do have ready, then I will use that one.

This is going to be great. I have too many of these open. Activate.

Okay, so you can place your tokens onto the map here by dragging them out. Reactor's tab.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I should not have. Great, Joan.

[Speaker 2]
I should have needed it. But it is the first thing I'm going to do anyway.

[Speaker 6]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 1]
I'll have you guys go at the bottom of the hallway here, representing where you guys came up. Somebody go ahead and make me an initiative roll. Everyone?

[Speaker 2]
Just one person. I have a banjo initiative, so.

[Speaker 3]
Do it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, let me. There's no combat encounter.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
There you go. Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 2]
What the fuck? What happened?

[Speaker 1]
When you open the door, you don't see anything in the hallway. The apologizing has stopped. You can see a little bit of, maybe, trash or something like that.

Yeah, a little bit of trash near the elevator door. But you can hear it humming and moving upwards. And the crying sound is no one.

[Speaker 2]
He be heard tears. Are there any doors near me that I can just open to see if there's anyone behind them?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you can. There are, like I said, you're going to put yourself at the hallway here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Right there. Everybody went down there.

[Speaker 3]
I see. This is the room that we were in. And this is the hallway.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
And this is the hallway. Ah, understood. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I'm something of an artist myself.

[Speaker 2]
I'm just going to start opening doors, trying to find this crying sound. Because it disappeared, and it's going to drive QB crazy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So you run over, you open the door. It doesn't really...

Make the investigation check this time.

[Speaker 2]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
You and one other person.

[Speaker 2]
QB is good at nothing but hitting things.

[Speaker 5]
I have a plus five to hit. Yours is super good at flying.

[Speaker 3]
There you go. I have a plus three. Yeah, I have a minus one.

I'm not rolling.

[Speaker 5]
I'll make a check. Hey. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, very good. You notice that the... It's very...

God, it's so slight. But you just happen to notice that the vent on the top, the grate on the top that's used for ventilation on the ceiling itself has a screw missing. Just one?

Just one. Looking down, you can actually see it quite nearly. You can see it on the ground.

[Speaker 2]
I'll unscrew the other one with my nails. Is that a thing I can do? The other screws and just take a peek up there?

[Speaker 1]
It is. It is. You leap upwards, and you will see something heading around the corner vent heading downwards, or heading southwards.

Just the vaguest shadow of something. The vaguest shadow against a fan inside the vent itself.

[Speaker 2]
Is it something with a tail?

[Speaker 1]
You do not see a tail.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna follow that bitch. Let's go.

[Speaker 3]
What do you see up there?

[Speaker 2]
Um... A shadow.

[Speaker 3]
Suspicious.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you just hear her mumble, shadow, and she takes off.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, where does she take off to?

[Speaker 2]
Hold on, before I take off, can I fit in the vent?

[Speaker 1]
You would have to shimmy. You can do it. Listen, an artificer's lab, in order to be safe, does require, you know, something that's open and spacious.

Like in chemical plants. Alright, so Kibi, you begin shimmying along. What is the rest of the party doing at this point?

Kibi has just hopped into the... said something's up there, hopped into the vent, and begun shimmying.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, following her.

[Speaker 5]
How high up's the vent?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's not so tall that you would struggle getting up there, but... since there's gonna be a bunch of people inside the vent, this'll be interesting. Um...

Hmm. Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Autogym's gonna go in the vent, sure.

[Speaker 4]
This might turn out incre- Actually, I'm not gonna fucking cascassious form, I'm just gonna shimmy through the vent.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, everybody is now shimmying through the vent. I said it went around the corner, and further to the south. Here's where it branches off, in a few different locations, you don't see anything down the, uh...

At this point, none of you have seen the critter, whatever it was, inside of the vents, but you come to a few different sections where it branches off, and specifically provides vent- There's a few different locations for vent access, inside of the main room where the residence seat is, where Professor Dickory is.

[Speaker 3]
What are the lighting conditions like inside of the vent?

[Speaker 1]
Inside of the vent, they are dimly lit.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna take out my drift globe and hold it in my hand, not activate it yet, but just in the off-chance.

[Speaker 2]
Do we see any, like, little dusty footprints anywhere? Leading to anything?

[Speaker 1]
Dusty footprints? Go ahead and make me an investigation check. Sixteen?

Sixteen, you could see that there are more recent- Okay, so you've come to- Right, you've come to a spot where it splits, and this is where it enters the room in the south. You can either go to your- To the west, or further south. You don't see anything at the end of either of these, but, the west, you do see that the dust has been disturbed more recently.

[Speaker 2]
You said that's what direction?

[Speaker 1]
To the west.

[Speaker 2]
To the west?

[Speaker 1]
That's right.

[Speaker 2]
I'll shimmy that way.

[Speaker 1]
So Kiwi starts shimmying west. How about the rest of you?

[Speaker 3]
Follow that kitty.

[Speaker 1]
Sure.

[Speaker 5]
Also follow Kiwi.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
Kiwi's going that way. Shortbeats are opening up a portal.

[Speaker 1]
I need somebody to make me a- It's just Kiwi. Kiwi, do you have any special trap-finding ability?

[Speaker 2]
Well, Blazer, does that answer anything?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I don't think so.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, then no.

[Speaker 3]
Fremen's a trapper.

[Speaker 1]
Fremen is a trapper. I'll let you- There's a lot of bodies covering the way? Well, actually, I think there's only one body directly in front of you.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So right now, you guys are like- I'm gonna move all you guys over this way. I think this is the proper marching order. Rowan's in the back.

Shim is there. You guys are headed- And you guys are headed to the west, so over this way. Then, yeah, I will let you make a check to how to find any traps with disadvantage.

Sorry. Just kind of as like a passive thing.

[Speaker 3]
You're not going to be able to make it at all because you're not looking, but the trapper- What would I roll for that?

[Speaker 1]
You have proficiency in thieves tools? Yeah, I mean, you should have proficiency in thieves tools.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I do.

[Speaker 1]
For being a trapper, right. Okay, and- Service units, Jesus Christ. So this would probably be with intelligence.

[Speaker 3]
So thieves tools or just intelligence roll?

[Speaker 1]
It would be with thieves tools, but so you would use your- Whenever it comes to a tool, you would pay your proficient and you always have your proficiency bonus, obviously, and then it's an ability modifier that matches your- It's an ability modifier that's determined by the referee.

[Speaker 3]
Gotcha. I think it's actually set to intelligence right now, so that works out. At disadvantage, you said, correct?

[Speaker 6]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Aw, four. Aw, 17 on the first roll, too. No traps here.

[Speaker 1]
So Ruff, you're just kind of shimmying along and you feel the hackles on the back of your neck raise, but you don't see anything, but not that it's Kibi, but Kibi feels it. She is currently- Right before she gets to the edge where the- where there's another T intersection, a wire kind of spreads out from the outside of these vents, from along the vent, and has closed on Kibi's neck. Uh-oh.

That's not good. It's 2d10 slashing damage, and you are presently suffocating. What is the party doing?

[Speaker 3]
Do we see this?

[Speaker 1]
You could see this, and you could definitely let the party know.

[Speaker 2]
How does resistance work?

[Speaker 1]
Halved. You halved it.

[Speaker 3]
But you're not raging, so- You're not raging at the moment, unless you were. But you wouldn't need to- It's shimmying through the fucking- Yeah, right.

[Speaker 4]
Unless, of course, your character is punching themselves every six seconds.

[Speaker 2]
She is focused on this task. This might be the only kind of focus that she knows to turn off the rage.

[Speaker 3]
Kibi looks like she's struggling with that wire. I'll take out this dagger and try and- The dagger, presumably made of metal. Yep.

You got it.

[Speaker 1]
There's a lot of things made of metal inside this.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. That's what I got.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, yeah. Go ahead and make me a- I guess another check with these tools. This one could be dexterity-based.

[Speaker 3]
Sleight of hand work?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if you want to just use sleight of hand for- as a proxy for it, then- Yeah, that would work.

[Speaker 3]
Normal or disadvantage on this?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this one's normal. Kibi's a lot easier to work around now that she's being held in place.

[Speaker 3]
Not debating the death. Eighteen.

[Speaker 1]
Eighteen, that's a lot better. Alright, you successfully free Kibi from her bonds here. Let's see here, auto Jim and Rowan, what are you two doing right now?

[Speaker 5]
Jim doesn't see the problem, because he doesn't have to breathe.

[Speaker 1]
Rowan's just going to go ahead and do this.

[Speaker 4]
He'll make things faster for the shimmying. Also, probably save his bacon quite a few times.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you start shimmying. Where is it that you shimmy to?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no, I cast Gaseous Form. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Metaphorically, are you sitting right there or are you moving somewhere?

[Speaker 4]
Moving along with everybody else. Actually, no, I should probably move. I should probably move.

[Speaker 2]
Why don't you pass in front of Kibi?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah, because I do have resistance to non-magical damage. So, probably should go ahead, considering lightning damage from the wires is probably not magical.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's slashing damage, not lightning.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Well, then I'll find them. Then Rowan will go ahead.

[Speaker 1]
Now I know why you were talking about the middle deck. It is a great indicate. Go ahead and move your character around.

Let's see here, Kibi, you are also now free. You can see Professor Dickory and a couple of other shadows near him, but nothing directly on him. He's in the center preparing, whatever it is.

A bunch of people just ran off and he's really just kind of engrossed in his work right now, you know?

[Speaker 2]
So, no sign of where this shadow went?

[Speaker 1]
Not presently. Rowan, I assume, is moving further down, but he just moved around the corner. He's hanging out.

Oh.

[Speaker 4]
I literally just see the... Yeah. The squiggles made here.

[Speaker 1]
And the clock is now ticking. Oh, boy. That's right, technically speaking, it's the next day.

[Speaker 4]
Does Rowan see anything further up ahead?

[Speaker 1]
Or is that right now? So, everybody is on that same... You guys get the setting, right?

The vents. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
And do they just go around in circles?

[Speaker 1]
Right, or upwards.

[Speaker 2]
Or upwards.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Right. Oh, up here as well.

For instance, you guys went through emergency maintenance.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, oh.

[Speaker 2]
I think we might have to go up.

[Speaker 3]
Backing up.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Rowan will just, like, ghost on past.

[Speaker 2]
Which, it also could be a terrible idea. You guys are following a barbarian.

[Speaker 1]
Otto Jim, what are you doing in the building?

[Speaker 5]
What's the quickest way to get to Dickery?

[Speaker 1]
There's a vent right next to you.

[Speaker 5]
Is he... Is it an exit?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. At the corners, that's where the vents are.

[Speaker 5]
Right, okay. What's Dickery doing?

[Speaker 1]
So, you can see him. There are two shadows on the floor next to him. And he is just getting the...

He's just getting the machine set up. He's nearly finished. He's got, like, four levers out of five that he's kind of already pulled down and they're showing a green light.

There's one left that's showing red.

[Speaker 5]
I will... Am I able to just leave the vent and help him?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
And that's in this room, this big one? Or upstairs?

[Speaker 1]
This is the big room. So you're dropping down into the big room. And you can see, in addition to the two shadows over there, you can see a second Dickery that is working next to a...

next to a workbench behind you. Towards the west.

[Speaker 5]
The auto-general must ask, How do you wish me to help?

[Speaker 2]
He's going to drop down there with him.

[Speaker 1]
Neither one looks towards you, but they both say... Yes, another one looks towards you, but they do both... Oh, if you could just...

If you could just go check in... If you could go call the elevator, I believe I forgot something upstairs. And they say it at the same time.

[Speaker 5]
Is this door area open?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, that's the one that you guys opened a moment ago.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. I'm going to start heading towards the elevator, then I'll dash, probably get to about here, dropping down.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, and then Rowan is moving up. Kibi, where are you going?

Fremen, where are you going?

[Speaker 2]
Kibi's going to follow the auto-gnome. He's very intrigued with this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so she's dropping downwards, and then Fremen...

[Speaker 2]
Plus he made a loud noise when he dropped in.

[Speaker 1]
And Fremen, what are you doing here?

[Speaker 3]
Doesn't seem like there's anything fun and interesting in the vents anymore. We don't see any sort of... scampering shadows or anything like that.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, nothing of that sort.

[Speaker 3]
Oop. Drop down in the big room and find a chair, and kick his feet up on a table someplace with as many doodads and gizmos as he can find on it. Lean back and just wait for the party to start.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. Okay, I'm going to have... everyone add themselves to the initiative here.

[Speaker 2]
Woo! I might want to reset it, because I do not want an 8.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. That was earlier.

[Speaker 2]
That's a 7.

[Speaker 1]
Pass it down.

[Speaker 2]
I can't change my initiative, but it should be fine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh cool, it's doing that thing where I have to reload. Okay, I'm going to remove Kibi from the initiative, and now you should be able to do that again. I, on the other hand, have to reload.

[Speaker 3]
That was a much better roll.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, now this is loading pool.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to add a background image this time. Aha! Excellent.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, damn.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so...

[Speaker 6]
Ooh!

[Speaker 1]
We're just going to imagine that it's been... clipped. You guys are going to...

Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine. So the top area will be on top. You guys...

Let's see here. Oh, and Rowan, you are... Okay, yeah, so...

Rowan, Kibi, and Jin, y'all are going to be at the top left or top right, respectively.

[Speaker 2]
So, like, up here? Is that a power armor helmet?

[Speaker 1]
I think it's a gas mask. Fallout 4 style, I like it. Makes more sense for Rowan to be right there.

Let's see here. That's right, that's fine. And then Fremen is free to hang out there.

Excellent. That's my chair right there. And then I never did find a good thing for...

So I'm just going to use... So there's two dickories here. One is next to...

Fremen. The other is next to the hex flower and all the levers here that are getting worked on. And then I got one last thing.

I hope you guys are ready for some fun. So, Kibi, a hound of shadow has just appeared nearby around the corner, scampering to start biting at your heels. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 2]
Probably rage first. Let me find a rage action. Where is this bitch at?

Here it is. Alright, and from there... I'm going to use my wonderful sword.

[Speaker 1]
So this is not going to work right now. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That's a 25 and a 26 to hit.

[Speaker 1]
They both hit.

[Speaker 2]
Same clock. Alright, a 9 and a 12 for damage.

[Speaker 1]
A 12. Very good.

[Speaker 5]
Shouldn't there be an extra d12? How did you roll with advantage?

[Speaker 2]
I... I mean with... Yeah, I rolled with advantage.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, remember you get an extra d12 for that with that particular sword.

[Speaker 2]
I need to keep that in mind.

[Speaker 1]
Discord updater. Okay, maybe that's why it's going a little funky right now. We'll see.

We'll see after this... After this combat, but that is fine. Let's see here, this one is...

Just going to continue working at his post. We have the Shadow Mastiff. Kibi was...

Kibi, which one were you damaging? The one right next to you, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the one closest.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and move your character over there.

[Speaker 5]
Why did it start glowing? Oh.

[Speaker 1]
That's to indicate the... That's to indicate that it's turn.

[Speaker 6]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
Shadow Mastiff right over here, which is going to run over and attack Fremen.

[Speaker 5]
What module does that? I need that module.

[Speaker 1]
This is Monk's... I don't know what the fuck this is, but...

[Speaker 5]
Combat Marker?

[Speaker 3]
Something like that.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's Monk's Better Initiative, I want to say.

[Speaker 3]
Sounds right. Strength saving throw?

[Speaker 1]
Only if it hits, which it did. And you did succeed. Indeed.

So, just going to roll the damage, which is 10. That's the end of its turn. And now we come to Rowan.

Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Drop Concentration. Then I'm going to... Move and dash.

Right about here. And end of turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Brings us to Autogm.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think I have the movement to get to anything without dashing, so I will dash to here. Yep, I'm done.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Okay. So, Professor Diggory is going to look up and, in shock, say, oh no!

My work! He's going to run past. And it looks as if he's dodging in between the Doppelganger and the Shadowmassive.

Fremen, what class are you?

[Speaker 3]
I am a Barbarian Rogue.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you would recognize the actions of not an Uncanny Dodge, but a Gunning Action. Okay, we have a Doppelganger here. Time to do Slam!

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I had a funny feeling, yeah, these guys were probably not supposed to be here. AC is 10, because no Barkskin.

[Speaker 1]
I see. They're all going to be rolling with advantage against you guys, because you guys did not spot them. Oh, so we're surprised?

Eh, not really. So, no sneak attack. Not surprised insofar as, like, I'm not letting you guys have your turns.

The puzzle was, could you guys figure out that these guys were here, or end up finding them split up to try to find things that we're attempting to hide. We sucked at that. We did not.

Alright, uh... So, total of 32 damage. Great.

Let's see here, are you still concentrating on this guy? No, I added concentration. Oh!

So, I am just going to take the full damage. This guy is going to dash. Do you have Halo's Force?

Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
So, that one would need to do concert.

[Speaker 1]
Which is, which is that one? Target it? Uh...

T? Click on it and press T? There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, wow!

[Speaker 4]
Yay.

[Speaker 1]
So, that's six in a crack. Very good. And then, this thing is going to attack...

Let's see here... Easter... Lemon...

A whole bunch of lemons in one place.

[Speaker 3]
E? Oh, that's not fun.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, now 14... Plus 14, so total of 28. Okay, and this doppelganger is going to...

Do... I will let one person make me an inside check.

[Speaker 5]
How did he not?

[Speaker 3]
Not me. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Rowan, you notice that the doppelganger looks like it's pretending to stop this one, but really it keeps backing up and backing up into the... into this Professor Dickory on the right. It's pretending to stop the one on the left, but it's really positioning itself to fuck with the Dickory on the right.

Okay. That's not good. And then this one is going to...

run over and attack the barbarian.

[Speaker 2]
Please do. It's...

[Speaker 1]
Doing good. Big damage overall, but... Definitely worse.

[Speaker 2]
Ten to five?

[Speaker 1]
Ten to five and a ten.

[Speaker 3]
That's two. Aha!

[Speaker 1]
Do you get add to... Yeah. Five, ten and a ten, so 25, I guess, add to 12?

Now it is Fremen's turn.

[Speaker 3]
Fremen not enjoying this experience at all. Proceeds to... Rage!

And let's get that rage marker on there. Just wrote it here. And there we are.

And he is pissed. He's going to look at Mr. Doppelganger, who beat the crap out of him a moment ago, and just kind of give him a wicked-looking grin. You won't be getting the chance to do that again.

He will be attacking recklessly. And using his scimitar, which is not turned on yet. But with advantage at 27.

That definitely hits. And... There you go, 13 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. If you hit... If you press T on the target...

If you click on the target that you're looking at and then press T, it will hover... Yeah, there you go. And then every time you roll an attack, it will show me whether or not it hits automatically.

[Speaker 3]
Understood. We should also hit show you guys.

[Speaker 1]
You have extra attack.

[Speaker 3]
I was about to say that was my first attack. Now I'm going to be doing this one more time. Again, advantage at 16.

That hits. AC 14. Wonderful.

Another 9 damage. And because I have advantage, I actually get to roll my sneak attack damage on my first one. That's just another...

Wow. Hey, guys. Well...

Two more. Yep. So that is a total of...

Math. 13, 9, and 2. So 25, 24, something like that.

And that is Fremen's turn.

[Speaker 1]
I believe Shadow Massive is going to attempt to stop Diggory from pressing... From getting the last lever here. It's just going to basically do a crab float.

And Kibi, your turn.

[Speaker 6]
Great.

[Speaker 2]
I will not forget to add the plus... Whatever, the D12. Hits.

Reckless attack. And another reckless attack.

[Speaker 1]
Also definitely hits.

[Speaker 2]
All right, awesome. And it's the damage that is the D12?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the D12 is the damage.

[Speaker 2]
Plus D12. Just a... Okay, yeah.

Found it. D12. And we'll do that one more time.

All right. So that's 22 and 19 for damage.

[Speaker 1]
Very cool. I added... Go ahead and ping the Sword of Most Hanged still one more time.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. I have another formula in there if you would like to just click that. There you go.

All right, it works. So you can do that for your damage next time. My damage...

He's dead. And you can engage your movement if you wish. Do any bonus actions if you wish.

[Speaker 2]
Where's the nearest... Feature? Down there?

[Speaker 6]
Where is it?

[Speaker 2]
There's your little buddy.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. All right, so the machine is currently charging up but you can see a few sparks of electricity coming out from the last lever that has not been pulled downwards.

[Speaker 2]
Are we supposed to be stopping whatever is going on here?

[Speaker 1]
No, at this point Dekkerini is saying, please, please, we can't leave this call incomplete. It's not supposed to work like this.

[Speaker 2]
Smash?

[Speaker 1]
No! Tell people the last lever! We have another Shadow Master which is going to attempt to...

Let's see here. I think what it's actually going to attempt to do is... grapple.

[Speaker 3]
Really? This'll be fun. Well, it should still be fun.

What's that, athletics?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, athletics or acrobatics. Ah, son of a... You have advantage while you're raging for athletics or other strength...

All strength checks, I'm pretty sure it is.

[Speaker 3]
Strengths. Indeed. Checks and single throws.

I guess I'll just roll it again.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, son of a...

[Speaker 1]
All right, so he's going to grapple you and move. What is half of its movement? All right.

40 feet. Okay, so it's going to say wolves, hunt and packs arisen. And move.

It's going to try to drag you off the side here.

[Speaker 3]
All right, let's go.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me a deck save. Sure.

[Speaker 3]
I have Danger Sense. You definitely would see this. Which gives me advantage on my Dexterity saving throw.

All right, advantage. 16.

[Speaker 1]
You're able to hold onto this thing's collar, basically, as it tries to throw you off the edge. It lets go of your arm and tries to toss you over, but you grab its collar.

[Speaker 2]
You're kind of barbarian, are you?

[Speaker 1]
Totem. There it goes, totem. Now that you've had a not-totem barbarian.

[Speaker 4]
By the way, did that Shadow Mastiff succeed on the grapple? Yes. All right.

This may go poorly.

[Speaker 1]
Going to need a Wisdom save on that one, boss. Go ahead and roll your damage. Definitely fails.

[Speaker 6]
And now they have to run.

[Speaker 4]
They do. Freeing him from the grapple. And also giving him an opportunity attack.

[Speaker 1]
Not presently wielding a weapon. Sure. All righty.

This is going to freak him out, too. All right, anything with your bonus action?

[Speaker 4]
I don't really have much with my bonus action.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 4]
Brings us to... I will... have a row and run.

This will get two opportunity attacks, but it's better than sticking around to probably still get murdered horribly.

[Speaker 1]
Auto-gym, maybe it's your turn.

[Speaker 5]
I'll cast Magic Missile at the doppelganger between the two dickories.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
It is.

[Speaker 1]
Did that do 3x4? 3d4?

[Speaker 5]
It did 3x4. I'm not sure what's happened. Um...

Ignore that. It was at 2nd level, so there's... There's four darts.

[Speaker 2]
We'll be right back.

[Speaker 1]
The original one just did... Well, here's the thing. The original one did plus...

That was so weird. It did, like, plus 7. Did you see that when you clicked on it?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it was odd. The formula for it is 1d4 plus 1 times 2 plus 2 plus add bonus. I don't know why that's imported like that.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe it rolls only once for... everything.

[Speaker 3]
It is only once. It should be only once. It only rolls once for everything.

And it's across each of the darts. Yeah, you don't roll individually for the darts or magic missile. Oh, wow.

Yep. I believe that's how the spell's written.

[Speaker 4]
I think that's... Yeah, that's also part of the reason why a tricker's so petty. Concentration checks and death saves.

Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, screw it. I'm gonna spell that. Wizard pocket sound.

[Speaker 5]
Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he looks significantly more hurt at this point.

[Speaker 5]
Right. Right, okay. Yeah, I see.

That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Where is this particular... Anything for your bonus action or movement?

[Speaker 5]
I already moved at the start of my turn. I'll use my bonus action to use my defensive build, which gives me a little bit of temp HP, but I'm all done.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this thing's gonna be cached over here.

[Speaker 4]
I just now realized I do actually have a bonus action, but there's no retconning, so...

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Let's see here. What's your alignment, by the way?

[Speaker 4]
Waffle neutral. Probably eventually gonna be leaving Waffle evil, but...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I gotcha. Do you have any... Let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
Halo spores, so... I know. Let's see.

Yeah, that is. Yep, that's two necrotic damage on that one.

[Speaker 2]
After this battle, can we take a five minute break? Absolutely. The dogs that I'm pet-sitting for need to go outside.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so we've got seven and nine. Alright. Gobbleganger.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh boy. He has to run down and... Wait, what happens if I just...

He has to go over.

[Speaker 2]
Down are we in initiative.

[Speaker 1]
So he has to dash to get next to you. Thank god. I was just dragging him over, and I'm like, Wait, that's not how it works.

Alright, this Gobbleganger, on the other hand, is... This guy doesn't have BHP. Which is...

It's a ball. Now at this point, he's dead. Ah.

Sometimes you have to just apply these automatically. Alright, so this Gobbleganger is going to go back over and start fighting with Diggory again. Diggory has not been making much progress on the lever.

It appears to be stuck in this kind of center position. And the Gobbleganger is now fighting with him to push it forward. Tim.

Brevin, what would you like to do? You are currently, technically speaking, grappling the Shadow Master. And partially hanging off the ledge.

[Speaker 3]
The Gobbleganger that died here... Did I kill him on the last turn? We just didn't realize...

Yeah, you would have killed him. Okay. I'm going to...

[Speaker 1]
The creatures in Children's Valley have a lot less HP than they do in the 5th edition Monster Manuals and stuff like that. There's a separate calculation that goes into them that fixes most of them. Or fixes them.

And for most of them, that means way lower HP.

[Speaker 3]
Gotcha. I'm going to utilize my Phantom Robe ability to collect his soul and turn it into a trinket. I'm pretty sure they need to die for that, though.

He did, actually, last turn. I believe I killed him. That's what we were talking about.

So I should have one trinket. I don't know where that is on my sheet, so I'll figure that out later. Alright, so I'm grappling this Mastiff, correct?

[Speaker 1]
That's quite correct.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Am I hanging over the ledge, or am I just holding onto him on the platform?

[Speaker 1]
A little bit of both. You can choose one or the other if you'd like to get a hand free.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I'm still holding onto my scimitar, I would presume.

[Speaker 1]
Have an elbow up and... Yeah, however you want to do it. You have use of both your hands, is what I mean to say.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. Oh, fantastic. So I will use my bonus action to go ahead and speak the command word, which is Flame On, and ignite my scimitar into a flaming sword of death.

And I will go ahead and use it to swing at this Mastiff while I'm grappling onto him.

[Speaker 5]
Very good.

[Speaker 3]
And we will go ahead and do this recklessly, because that's more fun. 17.

[Speaker 1]
It's, remember you can press T when you're hovering over him.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, yeah. There you go. So here's your damage, and then the flame damage.

So that's 18.

[Speaker 1]
And... And... Let's see how our team is doing.

Yeah. Alright, now that we'll kill him.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we'll kill him. Let's see here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, um, I am... I'm going to go take these dogs out.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you're fine.

[Speaker 1]
The combat's going to end at the end of the round here anyways.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Alrighty. I shall do that.

[Speaker 3]
And then I will hop over his dead corpse around Dinglehopper, and presume... proceed to attack the Shadow Mastiff.

[Speaker 1]
This guy is going to make an attack of opportunity, as he is the fake... Ah! Go for it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he attacks with advantage.

[Speaker 1]
You are free to do so as... Let's see here. You're free to attack while I do this as well.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. That hits. That's good.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to give him surprise. Can he shape change when... He remains shape-change while attacking.

He can, he can.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, let's do it.

[Speaker 1]
During the first round of combat... Oh, you're right. It's a surprise attack.

And I did not edit this text earlier, so whatever. I should have done that if I wanted. I'm going to take advantage of that again.

It's not damage.

[Speaker 3]
Half damage, because I'm raging.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, indeed. Flametongue. And I'm targeting you.

With advantage. Ah, that's good.

[Speaker 1]
This is the dead puppy.

[Speaker 3]
This is the dead puppy. Okay. Yeah, 24 damage.

And that's not including the sneak attack that I haven't applied yet. I'm going to go ahead and do that just for kicks. Another 17.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that you applied... Remember, all the dice are crit, so the flametongue scimitar, that's also...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so you get another 26. So that's a lot. That's a lot of damage.

I think he's just a flaming pile of...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you would have killed this thing's normal hit points if it was full health and single hit.

[Speaker 3]
Very good.

[Speaker 1]
At the end of the round, what's going to happen is... Diggory and this doppelganger here are going to continue fighting. The lever is going to snap, and the doppelganger is going to sort of fall into the resident seed here, and everybody is going to teleport, which will be...

End of combat there. Also gives me an opportunity to write down XP and such for what has actually been displayed so far.

[Speaker 2]
That didn't take as long as it usually does.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, hey! You're back.

[Speaker 2]
I am back. They must not like the nighttime, because they did that quickly.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you guys have actually... The combat has finished, because you guys are in the process of teleporting now.

[Speaker 2]
Oh? Where?

[Speaker 1]
Good question. I know the answer, but I will give you guys the opportunity to take a quick five-minute break, which I'll probably use to just use the restroom. And also tally up this XP.

If I do this after every combat, it's a lot easier.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to go and take my puppy out, which will take a little more than five minutes, but I'll come back on the tail end.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. That was three Shadow Mastiffs. And then two...

Wait, how do you spell it?

[Speaker 6]
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
One of the things I looked up was... They are... They're not available.

[Speaker 6]
Those ones are somewhere else.

[Speaker 1]
It might... It might be somewhere.

[Speaker 5]
I am back.

[Speaker 6]
I'm...

[Speaker 2]
And we're back.

[Speaker 1]
I'm back. Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody here?

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
I think so.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect, perfect. Let's see here. So...

Box party is teleported. I want everyone to make me a constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 5]
I'll use Slasher Genius to add five to mine.

[Speaker 1]
Fremen, make sure you're pressing... Let's see here.

[Speaker 4]
I am going to use some of my remedy dice on that ship. And... So, nine plus twelve.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you're going to be able to use it. Like, you're going to be incapacitated in this process. So I don't think that's going to work.

I'm going to have to say that might... That's also going to be the case for the autogym.

[Speaker 4]
It doesn't actually state whether or not...

[Speaker 1]
You cannot use it if you're incapacitated.

[Speaker 4]
That really should be... That text should really be added to things.

[Speaker 1]
I can't... Well, here's the thing. You're not able to take...

You're not able to do anything while you're incapacitated.

[Speaker 3]
It's a reaction. You can't take one if you're incapacitated.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I know. The problem is the remedy dice, for example. And the other, I think also the scholar dice.

The others, they're not reactions. Which is the weird thing.

[Speaker 1]
Right. But it's like you... It's still you doing something.

If that makes sense.

[Speaker 5]
We're incapacitated while we make the check?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 5]
Save?

[Speaker 1]
Okay. You guys... Well, let me explain the context.

You guys are unconscious after you are teleported. And the check is to see how quickly you guys wake up. Or to see if any of you wake up.

Go ahead.

[Speaker 2]
So what's a nat 20 equals to 30?

[Speaker 1]
You're going to be up way sooner than everybody else.

[Speaker 2]
Took a catnap.

[Speaker 1]
Quite literally. I'm going to add that to my task list, by the way.

[Speaker 4]
Like padding a line cannot be used if incapacitated.

[Speaker 1]
Just while incapacitated. And I'll synchronize that. Maybe I'll just add that to the class dice specifically.

I'll have to go back over unconscious again. Oh, wait. I can just mark somebody as unconscious.

Okay, so Kibi. It is nearing nighttime when you wake up here. The current date.

[Speaker 6]
If?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, did you say if?

[Speaker 2]
I made a noise.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
What is around me currently?

[Speaker 1]
Right now it is a lot of... Oh, there we go. You're able to surmise that you've been unconscious, knocked out for about six hours here.

It was noon when you left. Or around noon when you guys were teleported out. You're surrounded by a lot of broken machinery.

There is a great deal of blood on the ground.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to make sure that none of this broken machinery is my autognome friend.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Let's see here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, is everyone else just kind of laying sprawled out?

[Speaker 1]
So you can't see anyone nearby except for Professor Dickory. And there is a fair bit of... It doesn't look like the blood is his.

It looks like he landed in it. As did you. You have an opportunity to kind of get your bearings and check your surroundings.

[Speaker 2]
Is he unconscious?

[Speaker 1]
Looks to be.

[Speaker 2]
Huh.

[Speaker 1]
Not moving or anything like that.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to go nudge him with my foot.

[Speaker 1]
Kind of groans.

[Speaker 2]
Get up.

[Speaker 1]
Five more minutes.

[Speaker 2]
Up. And I'll pull him up. Where are we?

[Speaker 1]
I don't count myself a... As a professor, and an expert in all matters scientific, I'd say that we're outside. Looking around, I can see...

I don't know how well your vision is right now, but I can see mountains to the northeast. And to the southwest. And if I look that way, I think I see water.

He says, pointing northeast. Or sorry, northwest.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. We need to find the others. Follow Kibi.

She's going to start walking in a random direction.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, please. Let's get our bearings for a moment.

Go ahead and put yourself directly in the center here, where my cursor is at.

[Speaker 2]
All the cursors are at?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. A torch.

[Speaker 1]
A little bit of fire at this point from a lantern that somebody left behind.

[Speaker 2]
Convenient.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, I thought I'd have to use my Bunsen burner for cooking. Good thing I keep some supplies on me all the time. No, no, it's not the lantern.

It looks different from the lantern I'm revealing.

[Speaker 4]
No, no, no. Rowan has a hooded lantern, a bit of wrought iron background.

[Speaker 1]
So now I'm wondering if that's the same lantern. No, no, it's not. Well, I suppose Kibi wouldn't know, by the way.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
True.

[Speaker 2]
Now can I walk in a random direction? I'm searching for my companions.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Well, if you insist. I just don't...

I think it's a little dangerous out right now. It's all...

[Speaker 2]
Kibi laughs in the face of danger.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. If I whistle for you, please come back, alright?

[Speaker 2]
Will do. I'll whistle if I find someone. Kibi will.

She speaks in third person. Kibi will whistle if she finds someone.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. Okay, I want everybody to make another round of Constitution Saber Throws, please. And then Kibi, go ahead and make an Investigation check.

[Speaker 4]
Rowan ain't waking up yet.

[Speaker 1]
This is for... this is related to the outdoors, so I know you have Trailblazer stuff, if you would like to use them. For any of the challengers to come.

[Speaker 2]
I'll use one. I'll commit one to it. That's a D8.

Oh, it's 14 plus 7. I'm really bad at math. I'll give you a random number.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Let's see here. You find...

Fremen, who has woken up shortly. He was found by... you found him closer to the shore.

Rather large lake next to you.

[Speaker 2]
Found one! Do a short little whistle.

[Speaker 1]
Dickory doesn't move towards you, since it's not really his. He said he'd whistle for you, basically, if he came across danger. But now the two of you are together.

That's a little bit of a survival scenario.

[Speaker 2]
Does he look injured? Is he awake?

[Speaker 1]
Fremen is awake. Fremen, are you here with us?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I'm here. I just don't know where to drop in.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, don't... just put yourself towards the top right. You guys are in...

Right now the map is displaying where Keebee landed. Understood.

[Speaker 2]
Should I move that way?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Yeah, right now it's not a one-to-one representation of right where you are. That was a nice nap.

Fremen, you got a little bit of an aching back there. And a bit of a headache.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee. Am I spinning?

[Speaker 3]
Does your head hurt as much as mine does?

[Speaker 2]
Uh... Keebee's head always hurts.

[Speaker 3]
That is relevant. I could use a meal.

[Speaker 1]
Whatever was in your supply packs, or other backpacks you might have been using, they are present.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, I'm gonna make some rations.

[Speaker 2]
We must find the others. They must be here somewhere.

[Speaker 3]
We can multitask.

[Speaker 1]
What could go wrong? Let's see here. Fremen, this is the point at which I'm going to have you go ahead and open up...

...the journals section... ...of Foundry. It's a few tabs over.

And you should see something that says, Chillness Valley PDFs. Yep. Alright, go ahead and click on the one that says Exploration.

Because you guys are in a strange place. You have no shelter. You do not have all of your allies.

And so they're going to use the exploration system as a proxy for setting you guys up. You're a rogue barbarian, so you could use the class benefits of either rogue or barbarian. But the way it works is each person who gets a success for something...

...helps get rid of an encounter. And everybody who... ...fails at a task...

...basically puts an encounter back on the board. And succeeding at these tasks contains other benefits which are unique to the role that you choose. Like if you're the person who decides to be in charge of camping and finding some shelter.

Or being the cook. You get different benefits according to your class. For instance, we're going to have Kipi.

Pragatha, you go ahead and choose one.

[Speaker 2]
I could do Camper. I can use my Strength Athletics check to build the campsite. And I can add a Rage bonus to the check.

This is just angrily setting up this camp.

[Speaker 5]
Punching down trees.

[Speaker 2]
Cursing out the wilderness. The whole situation that brought her here. She could be on a random island of all genomes.

Let's see here.

[Speaker 3]
Fremen will probably take up the Vanguard position. Just scout around to make sure that no one is trying to...

[Speaker 2]
...jump them.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. And do you want to use Rogue or Barbarian benefits for that? Normally what you'll do is you'll use a...

Normally it's going to be Perception or Investigation for a check like this. Not bad.

[Speaker 2]
What's my Rage bonus? Where do I find that?

[Speaker 1]
Your Rage bonus, you're level 10, right?

[Speaker 2]
Level 9 Barbarian.

[Speaker 1]
Level 9 Barbarian. Did you take a level in Rogue?

[Speaker 2]
I took three levels in Fighter.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, that's right! Oh, interesting. So you're...

I'm pretty sure it's plus three.

[Speaker 5]
What level was it?

[Speaker 2]
Level 9 Barbarian. Yeah, plus three.

[Speaker 5]
It's in your class table.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so it's 19 plus three. Pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
You're able to... Let's see here. Did you want to reconnect with Professor Dickory, or were you doing this somewhere else?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we'd bring him along. I'm not going to leave him out there to be bait. When he can be bait on my own initiative.

[Speaker 1]
You spot a grove of trees that you're able to... ...that you're better able to make use of over here.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Plenty of logs for you to knock down. And then, let's see here. Fremen, you were thinking of a way to use your...

[Speaker 3]
I think I'll switch it up and go Hunter. Use my rogue abilities and stealth to try to find us some food to cook up.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
That makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
It does. It does. I think earlier you were talking about doing Vanguard with Athletics.

Just trying to think of a way to basically do that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think this one makes more sense. Yeah, this is totally fine.

[Speaker 1]
Especially given all the mention of food.

[Speaker 3]
Indeed. Twenty-two.

[Speaker 1]
Twenty-two succeeds. Quite a bit, actually. Go ahead and make me a d20 check.

Or just roll a d20. Nine. And what is the benefit for Rogue as a Hunter?

[Speaker 3]
That's a great question.

[Speaker 1]
When you click on the PDF on the left side, you'll see class benefits. And then, that will unfold to reveal... That'll unfold to reveal...

[Speaker 3]
Class effects?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Bedroll Nomad? Hunter, here we go. Poacher.

Killing your quarry doesn't alert nearby creatures, provided you have some means... What was pieces of it? Less.

Oh, interesting. So I don't alert other creatures, and I can carry away some of what I killed.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you got two options here. You can either hunt down a nearby buffalo, or you can hunt a... Or you found a Copperhead nearby in the bushes.

[Speaker 3]
I think the... While the Copperhead would make for better boots, the buffalo will be better for feeding people.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Very good, very good. So you take down the buffalo.

You're able to just kind of haul it over your shoulders and bring it back. With the impressive strength of Barbarian. It's not like a super old, particularly large one, but any buffalo...

When you're talking about food for four people, a buffalo is perfectly fine. Sufficient. Indeed.

Maybe more than sufficient. That tagged in something. Okay, at this point I'm going to have Autogen, and...

Yeah, we're going to have Autogen, and the last person... Rowan. Fucking Rowan.

I am... I need to... Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 5]
By the way, for that character...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, sorry, what did you say?

[Speaker 5]
Why do we need to put out tokens?

[Speaker 1]
Well, you need to make Constitution saves first.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, another Con save first. We don't just get to wake up for free. You're not feeling that nice.

You will eventually wake up for free.

[Speaker 1]
It's just, I'm checking for encounters at the same time.

[Speaker 5]
I know I can't use reactions in response to this. I have a feature, I'm not using it now, it's just a question. It's called Built for Success.

I've just pinged it, which lets me add a default or a save. Which isn't a... It's not a reaction.

I guess that'd be similar to Class Dice.

[Speaker 1]
Built for Success... Class Dice are things that you're doing actively, which is what I was... This is also kind of like an active thing.

[Speaker 5]
Actively built different.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Actively built different. I find these dumb wording and stuff like that, so I'm going to try to stay consistent with...

Natural language.

[Speaker 5]
As I said, I'm not using it now. Just curious. Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. In either case, so Rowan, you are going to wake up. And the people who are at the camp no longer suffer any kind of...

The people who are at the camp have not encountered any encounters. Professor Dickory is very upset, very nervous, and looking around constantly. So where do I...

[Speaker 2]
He'd be too. But she's more looking out for things because she wants to smash things.

[Speaker 1]
All right. Mr. Rowan. Where do I place my token?

It doesn't matter. Like I said, it doesn't matter. Do it from the...

Tell you what. Do it from the southeast. Oh, okay.

You and your sickle are walking along. Mr. Rowan. Do you see why this technology needs to be rid from the land?

I'm more curious about those Doppelgangers. Of course, this is what I mean. Do you think that they intended good for us?

Evil? Good for the... Perhaps more importantly, do you think they intended good for the land when they were...

assaulting the professor? Almost there.

[Speaker 4]
I imagine they were probably just after to make use of the resident seed for their own ends.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. And that's the problem. It's not as if people don't do the same with simple art, agriculture, farmland, hunting.

It's just... when they do, the land gets something out of it. The bloodshed serves a purpose.

Serves the land, specifically.

[Speaker 4]
And the skies and seas. Yeah, Rowan's just, like, steadily walking towards the bright light he's seeing in the distance there.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, there's still a lantern left here. It's getting dimmer. It's been burning for a while without any additional fuel injections, and it's going.

It's gonna go for maybe another hour here.

[Speaker 2]
This should be investigated.

[Speaker 1]
There's a great deal of blood, a great deal of footprints as well. What do you think, Rowan?

[Speaker 4]
Well, something tells me the doppelgangers did not exactly plan on falling into the resident seed as that one did. Now we have to find out what happened to that one. That's a lot of power.

Wouldn't do to see it in such poor hands.

[Speaker 1]
It would be quite the trouble. Indeed. It's an astute observation, but I want to know now what you intend to do.

There's blood here and prey out there. At the same time, we are wounded.

[Speaker 4]
Ah, that reminds me. I should go ahead and activate... this.

There we go. I should just go ahead and start healing myself up. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to keep going, I'll just do this silently. No worries. Okay, let's see here.

At this point, Mr. Autogym, you will have woken up. Excellent. You are quite close to a cliff face.

Let's see here. Looking out, you can see two campfires at this point. One is directly north.

The other one is east. Uh, what is it? Northeast bearing east.

[Speaker 5]
Um, I guess I'll head to the closest.

[Speaker 1]
At the closest one nearby is, uh, is the lamp. It's in the center here. You can see one of your previous companions healing themselves by the fire, or at least attempting to do so.

[Speaker 5]
Am I allowed to place my token there? You may, you may.

[Speaker 4]
Out of curiosity, how damaged are you right now?

[Speaker 5]
Me? Yeah. I am not damaged at all.

[Speaker 4]
Anybody else got two more uses of aura vitality?

[Speaker 1]
They are nowhere near you.

[Speaker 4]
Shit.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, never mind then. Back up to full.

[Speaker 1]
That's good. That means I save on hit dice. Never mind, I have to make another encounter check over on this side.

Click. Let's see what this critter is actually doing. Alright, auto-gym.

What are you... What are you doing?

[Speaker 5]
Are the others still making camp? Is that what's happening? Do I get to do a exploration roll?

You may, you may.

[Speaker 1]
So, right now you see Rowan Bayou. Uh, Keebee and Previn are nowhere to be seen. There was still that campfire to the...

Now the, uh, the southeast to your southeast.

[Speaker 5]
Shall we head to the campfire?

[Speaker 4]
Well, naturally. Something tells me that if we can see that light others can as well.

[Speaker 2]
Let's make haste. That's what Keebee's betting on.

[Speaker 5]
We'll head to the southeast, I think he said. Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
I'm just gonna activate Pass Without Trace from Staff of the Woodlands. Enjoy, uh... Auto-gym and I shall enjoy a nice plus ten to our stealth.

[Speaker 1]
Also, I sent you a DM about your character sheet.

[Speaker 5]
We're stealthin', are we?

[Speaker 1]
It looks like you guys are trying to stealth.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, that's plus ten. It's 22. Good, that's good.

Thank you, Pass Without Trace.

[Speaker 1]
Very good. And Rowan?

[Speaker 4]
23.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, Jim. It's taking you guys a little bit of a... It's a fair walk, but you guys are, you guys are stealthing, which is making it take a little bit longer.

Which exploration role did you choose?

[Speaker 5]
I would like to be the cook. Even though I don't eat, I have proficiency in brewer's supplies. I'd like to make some protein shakes with whatever gets gathered.

Arbitral.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Is making food crafting an item? Can I use Maker's Prestige? Yes, yes you can.

I'll spend a cloth, then. There we go, 19. That's better.

[Speaker 1]
Listen, it's all about, like, adding, you know, bases and, uh, bases and salts and stuff like that. The sauce isn't thick enough, we gotta add some, we gotta add a base to it. You know, it's all chemistry.

Let's see here. And Rowan, what is, what is the thing that you're currently using right now?

[Speaker 4]
You're gonna have to be a bit more specific.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. So, your character, what is Rowan doing for their exploration role?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, uh, so that would be... I would be going for... I'd be going for just a classic survival check.

But, uh, well, for the exploration, however, survivalist.

[Speaker 1]
Survivalist.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, go ahead and make your roll. I just need to pull up the right thing.

[Speaker 1]
Just a second. Alright, Mr. Popo, can you hear me?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I can.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, the, uh, let's see here. Rowan and Jim are presently in danger, as they are going to be approached by a, uh, they're gonna be approached by a doppelganger here that is wearing Fremen. The face of Fremen, we'll say.

[Speaker 3]
That does not suit me at all.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, what, in terms of, uh...

[Speaker 3]
Is someone impersonating me? I think not.

[Speaker 1]
I gotcha, I gotcha. Yeah, so you will be able to... Cross that out.

Perfect. Yeah, so you're gonna approach... Your character will have been just hunting a moment ago, and as opposed to collecting a buffalo, they will be holding a copperhead.

But this won't be live.

[Speaker 3]
Got it. And they won't know who's who, I presume. That's correct.

Alright, this'll be fun.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so that's basically how the rogue thing goes. Alright, cool. And then, Roman, I saw you got a...

Definitely got a success there. Go ahead and roll a d20 for your survival check. Sorry, not for your survival check, for the results of your foraging.

[Speaker 4]
Right. Foraging, foraging...

[Speaker 1]
Because right now, what the survival list does is they forage, and they prevent the party from getting lost. So just... You just roll a d20.

Sixteen. Thank you. There's also the herbalism thing, where as part of being an herbalist, you collect things while you're foraging and or traveling.

Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
So, also have to roll a d10 because of nature's...

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Or I think it's a d8 at this level. Oh.

Huh. Nice.

[Speaker 4]
I'll take your word for it. I'll also roll the d8.

[Speaker 1]
Four. Alright, so you'll find an herb in four days' worth of traveling. Okay, would you like to find either some snow bee honey, or some giant gastropod sludge?

Snow bee honey. Alright, when eaten... When consumed as part of a meal, it applies to anybody who has the meal, they gain ten temporary hit points.

[Speaker 5]
Put it in the thirteen shakes.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. You guys could use now's as good a time as any for you guys to get some health.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I mean, because it's a survivalist thing for druids, I already have 2410 HP.

[Speaker 5]
There you go. The others are barbarians. Yeah, they'll be fine.

[Speaker 2]
Keebee's at 88.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, come here. Those guys didn't do shit to Keebee.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, while you guys are out looking, let's see here. Fremen walks up to you guys fresh out of the bushes in the middle of having, literally right in front of you guys, caught a copperhead snake.

[Speaker 4]
So now's as good a time as any to do the to mention the doppelganger thing.

[Speaker 2]
Doppelganger thing?

[Speaker 4]
Or is that...

[Speaker 1]
Because you were talking with your sword earlier about how the doppelgangers might have accidentally fallen in with the people.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, like the one that fell into the resonance seed.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, one of us is an imposter?

[Speaker 4]
Might not be one of us. Right?

[Speaker 2]
Hold on, are you at the campfire? Like, would we know that?

[Speaker 4]
Fremen is by us, but...

[Speaker 2]
I said campfire.

[Speaker 4]
Well, Fremen is next to us and Autogen. Yeah, but you are currently doing your thing. So, am I right or am I right?

[Speaker 1]
Am I crazy? Alright, so right now, Rowan and Jim are next to each other and Fremen just stepped out of the bushes. Fremen, you just found your party.

[Speaker 6]
Wow.

[Speaker 3]
Hello. Where did I step out of?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you'll be right next to the bushes there, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 3]
Carry my buffalo?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, so you just caught a snake right in front of you. Gotcha.

[Speaker 5]
Nice. I do not have anything to test for duffelgangers, so...

[Speaker 4]
Let's get a red hot spike.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a way that we can even test them? I could scratch. Keepie could scratch.

Uh... into people's skin. Maybe it would reveal itself.

[Speaker 1]
What is Keepie doing right now?

[Speaker 2]
Um... Probably just kind of, um... I mean, she's set up camp, so probably just sitting around the campfire.

[Speaker 1]
At the mention of duffelgangers and duffelganger paranoia, um... Professor Dickery immediately says, like, look, dude, I... I do not want this to go how I'm expecting it to go.

This is back at camp. Just, look, you can... scratch me if you must.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, man, I have a much better option. He's here. Rowan is not there.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm talking to Frebendanatogym. Oh, okay. For the duffelgangers.

This is out of my previous idea of just a red-hot spike, though. Well, did you know that the... one of the best enemies against shape-changers and fellow druids is other druids?

[Speaker 5]
Does not compete.

[Speaker 4]
It's a little spell called Moonbeam.

[Speaker 2]
The moon is up there.

[Speaker 5]
Don't worry.

[Speaker 1]
You guys aren't next to each other. What the fuck? That's why I didn't want to put people on the map.

[Speaker 4]
Like, that was why I was initially confused.

[Speaker 1]
I said six times. Hey.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to scratch the guy.

[Speaker 5]
I do not have darkvision.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not like... I'm not going to maim him. I'm not mauling this guy.

I'm just a singular scratch. It builds raw blood.

[Speaker 1]
Right before you hit, he goes, No, no, please! Okay, now I'm ready.

[Speaker 2]
She does.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So, Fremen and Kibi, you two are back at camp. You're with...

Sorry, not the auto-gnome. You are with... Jim?

Sorry, not Jim. You're with Professor Dickery. And Professor Dickery is just kind of...

No, he's upset. He's just been scratched very swiftly. It cuts, it sinks in, and he very quickly goes to cover it up.

He's like, Oh, it's going to get infected. Cats, no offense, but cats do...

[Speaker 3]
This one looks like she cleans under her nails.

[Speaker 1]
I should have just asked to disinfect anyways beforehand, but I appreciate it. Anyways, when is that buffalo going to be ready?

[Speaker 3]
As soon as we can cook it up.

[Speaker 1]
That shouldn't take too long.

[Speaker 3]
As long as someone knows how to cook buffalo.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I don't have my tools on me. Kibi, did you say that you hold the... Did you say that you have it?

Oh, you're like cutting in and out right now. Oh, are you there?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm here. Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Hi. I didn't know if you were talking to us or not. Yeah, so, are you guys just kind of waiting it out?

Like, waiting for something to approach you guys at this point?

[Speaker 3]
Well, I've got a buffalo on my shoulders and we've got Dickery. We should probably go and find the other two.

[Speaker 1]
Right now, you guys are at camp.

[Speaker 3]
We are at the camp right now. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Well, we also have a snow shipment, so something will come to us. Either it'll be fun, or it will be...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wait. Farguth, are you talking?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. You sound like you're underwater. Here, try talking again.

Oh, hi. Yeah, no, now I can hear you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah, I think we should stay at camp. We have a smoke.

Currently, we have a smoke signal. Well, not an actual smoke signal, but closest thing to it. Going, so something will come to us, whether it's something fun or something convenient, like our people.

[Speaker 3]
Sounds good to me. Alright, let's figure out how to... Let's start cooking up this meat, then.

Excellent, excellent. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then, I'm gonna drag this over here. There we go. Over here.

[Speaker 4]
As soon as it gets destroyed, it just suddenly blows up. You open a door, it just suddenly explodes as though someone put ten tons of TNT on it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I just carry my hydrogen around in my pocket. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Experimenting gets better, Kennen.

[Speaker 5]
They have the private. What happened?

[Speaker 1]
Very good, very good. At this point, let's see here. Okay, good news.

Rowan has approached the camp. Talk amongst yourselves. Okay.

Let's see here. Fremen... Oh, I already told him to make an insight check, so he'll do that in a second.

Fremen, go ahead and make me an insight check, and Annojim, make me an insight check as well.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, man. Got a one.

[Speaker 1]
Not a lot of trust. Not a lot of trust going around. You guys are all of a sudden very suspicious of one another.

Sorry, I shouldn't say you are very suspicious of one another, but it is unclear. It has become clear to you just how unclear it is who your allies or enemies are in this situation. None of you know each other very well.

Yeah. There you go. What are you guys...

At this point, Rowan is... Sorry, Rowan. Rowan points to Jim at this point and says, I don't know if the doppelgangers can actually...

I don't know if the doppelgangers can copy a metal form, but I'm a little bit suspicious of Fremen over there.

[Speaker 5]
Can I do, like, a recall knowledge about doppelgangers to see if I know any tells about them with, like, Arcana or...

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
History? I'm rolling like garbage.

[Speaker 1]
14? No, that's perfect. So you know that doppelgangers will...

You know that doppelgangers are neutral. They're usually fairly easy to negotiate with, but they... They're pretty ruthless killers.

They're usually hired on contracts for obvious reasons. But they're also fairly easy to buy out, and they're happy to betray their own. If it means that they get to live another day.

As far as me testing them, usually you have to ask if there's something only the other person would know, and hope that the doppelganger hasn't, like, found a way to get a hold of it. They can't copy magic items.

[Speaker 5]
I wouldn't be able to do magical abilities as well. I saw Rowan do the Halo of Spores.

[Speaker 1]
You didn't see Rowan do the Halo of Spores, actually.

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, he has 8 staff.

[Speaker 5]
The doppelganger creates, like, a replica of, like, an item. Is it fixed to their body?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. Like, they can copy, like, images of equipment and stuff like that. It's not super fixed to their body, but also they can just, uh...

Yeah, it's just, it's not really how it works. Like, they can copy, kind of, uh... They can copy, like, clothing.

[Speaker 5]
And I was suspicious of both, uh, Rowan and Fremen, right? Yeah, you're just, like, really not aware of, like, anything that indicates these people are who they say they are.

[Speaker 1]
Or you're, like, aware that neither of them have, uh... have attempted to create themselves right now, if that makes sense.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I... I just don't know how to... How to...

Because I have minus two to charisma, minus one to wisdom. Like, obviously that doesn't make me, like, completely socially inept, but he's missing cues for sure. Um...

[Speaker 1]
There's always intelligence.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any spells that could help with this? Any kind of...

[Speaker 5]
No. I've been looking through my list. I don't.

The best I have is invisibility, but that doesn't help with, like, illusions or anything. Um... I...

will ask, um... Rowan to cast a spell. Prove your magic capabilities for me.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Right. Uh...

Here's the thing. I used all of my spells back... back there.

What's the trouble? He looks like... He pretty obviously looks like he's lying.

[Speaker 5]
Punch him in the face! Nice!

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Bremen, how do you react?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know these guys at all and what their abilities are or aren't, so I have less of a notion as to what, you know, the capability is of Rowan.

[Speaker 1]
Right, but you guys gotta do something. The night is passing. Going away.

[Speaker 3]
You know what? I'll jump on the bandwagon. I'll punch him in the face, too.

Excellent. Looks like fun.

[Speaker 5]
If we kill Rowan accidentally, this is gonna be very funny.

[Speaker 3]
Knock him unconscious. We'll have to kill him.

[Speaker 5]
Would you like me to make an attack?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, that's fine. You guys are able to knock him unconscious and tie him up pretty quickly. Everyone's prior form.

[Speaker 5]
Can barbarians do the show themselves? I can't ask you to rage, because you might actually be out of that, and if I punch you over that, that's not good. Barbarians also get danger sense.

[Speaker 3]
Why don't you just ask me a question that only I would know?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know a question that only you would know. At this point, you guys hear some howling out in the night, and it does not sound like wolves.

[Speaker 3]
It sounds a little bit closer to bugs. Well, if we weren't here doing this, I'd be having a feast right now. That's how you know it's me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Rowan, you have approached, and you see Professor Dickory with Fremen and Peebee here. What have you been up to?

[Speaker 4]
Making plans, making vague generalizations on my end about what could be done about the Doppelganger thing, and then a little bit of discussion about Baldur's Gate 3.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. Are you guys trying to figure anything out or do anything at this point?

[Speaker 2]
Um, kind of want to just get to the others so that we can talk about it with a bunch of other people, because I don't exactly know what's going on.

[Speaker 1]
No worries. All right. I'll be right back here.

Okay, I am back. Can you hear me? Yes.

Professor Dickory is going to leap out of the bushes with a wound on his arm. He has his full kit with him. He was halfway through.

You could tell, Jim being an artifice yourself, that he was about halfway through assembling his Thunder Cannon, or only got about halfway through assembling his Thunder Cannon when he was, before he had to run here. He's like, we need shelter. We need shelter right now.

Quickly, please. Is that your campfire? What was that?

Sorry? Is that your campfire off in the distance?

[Speaker 3]
Our what?

[Speaker 1]
Is that your campfire off in the distance? He's pointing to the southeast.

[Speaker 5]
I have not been there yet.

[Speaker 3]
That's entirely possible. Maybe we should go check it out. See if the others are there.

[Speaker 1]
He goes over to pick up the lantern, but it sputters at this point because it's, like I said, it's on its last hour here. It probably doesn't really have enough fuel to last it if it's going to be running, if he's going to start jogging with it at full sprint. He just kicks it over into the bushes and lights one of them on fire.

[Speaker 3]
A bush on fire? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, and starts running southeast. We'll follow him.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Bring the doppelganger. We need to interrogate something.

[Speaker 3]
Sure, I'll throw Rowan or the doppelganger, whatever it is. You said it reverted back to its original form, like it became the doppelganger? That's correct.

Actually, wait, no.

[Speaker 1]
Let me check. Do they do that?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know if they do that when they're unconscious.

[Speaker 5]
It reverts to its true form if it dies.

[Speaker 1]
Right, and it's not dead.

[Speaker 3]
It's not dead, it's just unconscious.

[Speaker 1]
It just looks like Rowan. But you would know that it actually has to die in order to revert to its true form, so it's like a choice for you guys to make.

[Speaker 5]
I don't think we should kill it.

[Speaker 3]
Well, no, because if it's not, then we'll just kill Rowan for no reason. Yeah, we'll tie him up and I'll throw him over my shoulder. Should be able to carry him with me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. The entire party is now going to meet up at the... Yeah, the entire party is going to meet up here at the campsite with an extra Rowan, an extra Fremen, and an extra Professor Dickory.

There is a fire further to the northwest, roughly where the lantern was. Someone kicked it over, Professor Dickory kicked it over, lit a few bushes on fire, and you guys can see from here, there are some... You'd have to make perception checks to figure more out, but something with a lot of legs, or sorry, many things with a lot of legs have gone around the fire, having given it a wide berth, and are now outlined, or silhouetted against the fire itself.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they're cool and all, but did you say something about...

[Speaker 4]
So you just said extra Rowan, right?

[Speaker 1]
Extra Rowan, extra Fremen, and extra Dickory.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to go...

[Speaker 4]
I am blatantly going to target that fake Rowan.

[Speaker 1]
I am not taking chances.

[Speaker 2]
How do we know it's fake?

[Speaker 1]
Go to roll initiative. I know... We'll have everyone roll initiative.

It's not like necessarily that everybody's switching to Rose right this second, but some people are going to attempt to stop Rowan. And then...

[Speaker 5]
I think they refreshed.

[Speaker 4]
As he... Upon seeing the Toppleganger, Rowan is just going to scrape out, Toppleganger!

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, when Kimi saw extra people, she pulled her sword out. We're going.

[Speaker 1]
Here's the thing. Some people are going to attempt to just stop the attack. Start off with...

[Speaker 4]
Did you double my tokens? I can select both of them.

[Speaker 3]
We're all around the campfire now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we'll use this as our campfire analog, basically. I'll use that Wristwind token from earlier. That should work nicely.

[Speaker 2]
Should we be somewhere specific on the map?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, go ahead and put yourself around the campfire now.

[Speaker 2]
I'm singing the campfire song.

[Speaker 4]
Because I know this one's me. What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck, Mortis Unconscious? That's funny. Anyways, I'll take that ball for the...

[Speaker 4]
No.

[Speaker 1]
The increasingly confusing moment of tokens. Okay, Fremen. Do you see your friend going to cast a spell here?

Or do something else? Do something else aggressive? Are you intending to stop him?

[Speaker 5]
No. I'm going to let it play out. Sorry, Fremen.

Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Who is it that's attempting to cast a spell?

[Speaker 1]
The druid is attempting to cast a spell at the moment. Yeah, Rowan.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so there's one that's over my shoulder that's unconscious, and then there's one that's not unconscious that's attempting to cast a spell. That's right. Okay.

I'm going to drop the one that... What do I know about Doppelgangers? I guess is the next best question.

[Speaker 1]
Uh... Jim could have explained... Yeah, go ahead and make me an Arcana check.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, let's roll that as terrible as this... Oh, shit! That worked out nicely.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so maybe you would have had a... Because you're a rogue, right? Doppelganger is a bad business.

Generally, if someone brings one of those in, it's because they didn't want to pay a proper rogue, a proper Assassin's Guild. And if they... Once they get involved, that's...

Things tend to get really fucking messy. They do not really care about collateral damage. Quite frankly, they don't even really understand the term.

[Speaker 3]
Gotcha. Well, I know that I am the real Fremen. I'm going to drop Rowan.

I'm going to take out my Gwent Confirmatar, ignite it, and then run up to the other Fremen and attack him.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alrighty. So, the other Fremen drops Rowan over his shoulder and attacks Fremen.

Oh, god. This is so confusing. Yeah, this is going to be a little scuffed.

I hope you bear with me. This is definitely the last time I'm trying this.

[Speaker 3]
It's entertaining.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I know what this should be.

[Speaker 3]
Do you want me to do the attack roll and everything? Yeah, yeah, if you do the attack roll. Alright, I'm doing this reckless, so advantage.

.2?

[Speaker 1]
And then just do the regular damage, not the flame damage. Okay. For the first one.

Alright, so 10 damage to the first one and then roll a second attack. 26. That hits.

16. Alright, so is real Fremen still up?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, he is. Real Fremen is still up. Real Fremen is not happy at the moment.

[Speaker 1]
I can see that.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Kiwi.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I don't know who the real Fremen is, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct, but one just attacked the other.

[Speaker 2]
Pick a number.

[Speaker 4]
Eda Rowan just attacked Rowan. Wait, which of us should pick a number?

[Speaker 2]
Whoever who's playing Fremen?

[Speaker 3]
That's Mr. Popo.

[Speaker 2]
Mr. Popo, pick a number between 1 and 2.

[Speaker 3]
Which? Oh, 1. Wait, between 1 and 2?

1 and a half. 1 and a half. I like this guy.

[Speaker 1]
He's a good guy. He's kind of great.

[Speaker 6]
I'm tired.

[Speaker 2]
I wonder if this will work. Oh my god, it did. Okay, I attacked the other guy.

Which one is that?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, you're attacking fake Rowan. The one that just attacked or the one that was attacked?

[Speaker 2]
The fake one.

[Speaker 3]
Well, you don't know which one's the fake one.

[Speaker 1]
Right, but I know which one the fake one is, so Kiwi, you're attacking the one to the north there.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'm getting rage. Hits.

I'm also gonna rage at this point. Let me do that real quick. Okay.

And now... Did the 13 hit?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the 13 did hit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll do damage.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that you can not kill this thing. So the doppelganger reverts to its true form at this point.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so I'll just do that. Ugh, I'm glad I picked right. Wait.

[Speaker 3]
Me too. Hi. Fucking hurt.

[Speaker 2]
I think he's dead. Is there another one around here? There's an extra person, right?

[Speaker 1]
So you would kill it by, um... You would kill it with your second attack there.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I just don't think you can survive both attacks.

[Speaker 2]
So don't bother with damage?

[Speaker 1]
Right.

[Speaker 2]
And is there another person that is...

[Speaker 1]
There's a Ikari copy and there's a Rowan copy. But you don't know which is which. One of the Rowans is knocked out, correct?

That's correct. He's actually bound in ropes and whatever else the auto-gym decided upon.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just some work.

[Speaker 2]
Can you...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the other Rowan, immediately upon seeing that screamed out Doppelganger and began casting a spell.

[Speaker 2]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
I was doing something aggressive.

[Speaker 2]
Can you also pick a number between... Oh, never mind, my bonus action was Rage. You're good.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Come in. Alright.

A Doppelganger just came in, carrying your Druid companion, but your Druid companion came in earlier. Do you have any means of figuring out which one is which, or what's your aim here? Do you want to kill something?

Do you want to stop people from being killed?

[Speaker 3]
Or do you want to try to figure out a problem? I mean, I would like to kill a Doppelganger right now. Which Rowan is the one that's unconscious, just so that I can distinguish between the two, if we could mark one.

[Speaker 1]
Right, the one right next to you. Unfortunately, I can't. Okay.

The one that's conscious is right next to you right now.

[Speaker 3]
Is right next to me, okay. So this one, which the Doppelganger is carrying is unconscious, right here. Yeah, the one in the north.

[Speaker 4]
Huh? Okay, now I'm confused, because...

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry about it, Rowan. It's the one in the north.

[Speaker 3]
Don't worry, that's... Um, Rowan's gonna turn to the conscious Rowan and say Where did I sleep when you first met me? In the lab.

[Speaker 4]
Just kidding. I genuinely... Like, my mind right now is like completely fucking cooked right now.

[Speaker 1]
I swear, you and Rez are on like weed or something before the session. Yeah, I'm just fucking with you, man.

[Speaker 5]
I wish. I buy. I genuinely can't answer that question.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, what did you say? What did you say?

[Speaker 3]
Would this Rowan be able to answer that question? Where did I first sleep when we got to the lab?

[Speaker 1]
He's asking Mech the person, would he be able to?

[Speaker 3]
Go ahead and roll an insight check. I'm actually asking you, because I don't know if he remembers where I was right now because of the substance that may or may not be imbibing.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, no, but... Uh... However, I would probably...

I do remember when Autogem was introducing himself to the... to Rizwan. I believe it was.

Uh... You were not able to figure out why you were here. But you decided to...

But you decided to... But responded by... Responded with wanting to help and dropped out of the vent.

Later on. Like... No, drop out of the vent and...

[Speaker 1]
Alright, friend. It's time for a split-second decision. What do you do?

You got a fumbling bumbling druid right next to you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no shit. A fumbling bumbling druid is gonna get knocked unconscious. And we'll figure this shit out later.

Good fucking luck. I know, right? So, yeah.

I'm gonna attack him to try... Attack him non-lethally. Right, attack him to subdue.

Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Would that revert the form of a...

[Speaker 3]
No, they have to die.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Do you have diamond? That's why it's non-lethal.

[Speaker 1]
But the druid casts Ruinify. Oh shit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but if we kill the druid...

[Speaker 1]
That's my deal.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I know. Alright, so... Reckless Swing.

And... Let me target him real quick.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, is this the rune that's been hanging out with me?

[Speaker 4]
For context, my brain is basically cooked because I can only get like four or something.

[Speaker 3]
And... Seven. Is that enough to...

Based on his... Oh, he was healed up to full. Oh fuck.

Yep. Probably not enough. And also temp HP.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, alright. Did you activate your flametongue? Or did you rage?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I can activate it and subdue him. I think the elemental damage would kill him, wouldn't it?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, you could use it for... You could still use it for...

[Speaker 3]
I mean, five basic duel rules but we'll work with the system. Well then there's another 14 for what it's worth. Though it didn't actually do what I needed it to do.

Alright, and that's it. I got nothing else. I guess if he attacks me back then we know he's the bad guy.

There we go.

[Speaker 5]
I'll do you one better. Let me steal that oil for a decade. A decade.

[Speaker 4]
Rowan will remember this.

[Speaker 3]
Which Rowan?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so how much total damage was it? Applied? Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Antidotes returned? No, that's it. I'm spent.

Okay, for here... Move away five feet. There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Both of our Professor Dickories here are going to say wait, stop, stop, please, please, we need to work together. It's of vital importance here that we work together.

There are other things out here. Yes, yes, I agree completely. They're starting to talk back and forth with each other.

Of course I'm the real Professor Dickory. No, I'm the Professor Dickory. Regardless, we are in danger here.

There are things coming, and like it or not, there's probably some utilities in numbers in a situation like this. What is the rest of the party's reaction to this? Give me a split-second decision here.

Rowan ain't having it.

[Speaker 2]
Kibi is going to kill both of them if one of them reveals themself. Try to say that out loud.

[Speaker 1]
Wait. You say that again?

[Speaker 2]
Kibi is going to kill both of them if one of them doesn't reveal itself. She's still raging.

[Speaker 1]
I think both of them are going to back up. Away.

[Speaker 2]
Was I just pretty much with Rowan for, like, a while?

[Speaker 1]
Not a huge while, but long enough. What are you looking to... What are you thinking?

More importantly, what's the rest of the party so if Rowan's not having it and then... and then...

[Speaker 3]
Redman, what did you say? I just backed away at this point. I can't...

My mind hurts. Thinking hurts. Ouch.

[Speaker 1]
I gotcha. And then Jim?

[Speaker 5]
Jim's happy to work with both Dickories, but he's also happy to let them both die as well.

[Speaker 2]
So... Okay. Are these guys needed?

Like, what is... Who are these people? Well, person.

Who is this person that is currently doppelgangered? The doctor.

[Speaker 4]
I can bring back the real one if needed.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, okay. Kibi's charging.

[Speaker 1]
I normally never do this. Rowan, make me a persuasion check and Kibi, make me an insight check. Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Are you about to fuck shit up? Like, actually fuck it up? Alright.

Insight, you said?

[Speaker 6]
Insight.

[Speaker 3]
Can he bring the good doctor back?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, Kibi's free to react how Kibi wishes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. What was that about?

[Speaker 1]
I was to see, you do not necessarily disbelieve Rowan, but Miss Rowan.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna charge forward.

[Speaker 1]
Now, the two Dickories are very easy to distinguish because one of them is heavily injured, and the other one Okay, I'll attack the heavily injured one.

[Speaker 3]
What? No, he's the one that was getting fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Isn't that Rizwin's turn, though?

[Speaker 2]
What is it? Sorry, I was going for the weakest mentality. Right, no, you're right.

[Speaker 1]
Those two were, like, standing back and forth. One of the residents will cast Cure himself. Now we come to Rowan.

Ooh, well, actually what I should first start off with is the one that's, quote, unconscious is going to regular round. Is he ganked?

[Speaker 3]
I think we just tied him up.

[Speaker 1]
You just tied him up. Alright, he shapeshifts back into a doppelganger and says, please wait.

[Speaker 4]
I will and what about the other ones? I'm going to use my Bear of Remedy dice.

[Speaker 5]
Two of them on both of them.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you need to go here or I guess here.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. And I'm going to reduce their consaves by that much. Both of them.

[Speaker 1]
So first one by five, second one by twelve. Yes. Okay, so the one on the right that wasn't injured prior will revert to a doppelganger.

So he will revert to a doppelganger.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. And by doing so, Rowan will end concentration. Thereby not damaging the actual Rizwan anymore.

[Speaker 1]
That was just heavily damaged. The one in the center is dead. And a turn.

[Speaker 4]
You just skipped over auto-jump.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't do it. The combat tracker. It still says auto-jump on my end.

Auto-jump, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to cast Kill Wounds on the Royal Dickery.

[Speaker 4]
I do not know why it is. I rolled it. Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Alright. The top of the round I guess there's literally only one doppelganger left on the board here.

[Speaker 2]
And he's in doppelganger form?

[Speaker 1]
He's in doppelganger form.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
If you guys want to kill him, he will not be able to effectively resist.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, Kibi wants to kill him, so if it's an initiative thing, he's dying. If it's a group thing...

[Speaker 1]
Kill on him.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead. He's probably taking the dodge action, but I don't think it's going to really help him. Make some attacks if you wish.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think he's going to help us.

[Speaker 2]
That's too bad. I kind of wanted to talk to him. Well, I wanted to hear from him, but Kibi, no.

Kibi doesn't care.

[Speaker 4]
Dodge action, so disadvantage right here. You are after him.

[Speaker 1]
Oh. Fuck. Yeah.

Sorry. He's doing the dodge action, so it's disadvantage. You can reckless to cancel that out.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I'll just roll a normal real quick. 13?

[Speaker 1]
Just succeeds.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Can he do the dodge action twice?

[Speaker 1]
The dodge action is versus all attacks against him.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want me to roll again just normal, or take the lowest or the first one?

[Speaker 1]
Do you roll again for... Yeah, so you would roll...

[Speaker 2]
27 and a 15. And I can roll damage now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure thing.

[Speaker 2]
And I included the d12 in it.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to cast a a real Professor Diggory is going to cast a spell called Intervention that turns a... There we go. It's going to turn a blow to kill into a blow to subdue.

And basically turn it into a non-lethal dagger.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see. But to you guys, it looks as if he didn't cast a spell at the special moment. You guys are out of combat.

Congratulations. For the moment. There's still nasty things approaching out of the dark, but you know.

You got time.

[Speaker 2]
Who killed them two?

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone have any sort of miracle healing elixirs that they might be able to share? My three very bloody messed up hit points could use a little buffering.

[Speaker 2]
How much damage did you take the last time you got hit?

[Speaker 3]
I will need to scroll up.

[Speaker 2]
Would I have all of my survival dice back?

[Speaker 1]
Except for the ones that you used earlier?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I used any. No, I used one earlier. Okay.

So I'd have 11.

[Speaker 3]
16 from the attack from the doppelganger.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I have... Which one is it?

Heal medicine or exercise healing? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I'll cast Cure Wounds on Fremen twice.

[Speaker 2]
How's your health now?

[Speaker 3]
Much better. Not great, but much better.

[Speaker 2]
Is it worth getting the 16 back?

[Speaker 3]
Always. They'll give me the half.

[Speaker 2]
I was at three hit points. Attempt to alleviate the last wound you and allies suffered by expending survival dice. If the total rolled by...

Here, I'm just going to put that in. Someone with a brain can figure that out. I will expend two survival dice just in case.

So that'll take me down to nine.

[Speaker 3]
And that's a d8. Yeah, it doesn't actually heal you. Unless you have a healer's kit on you.

[Speaker 2]
I do.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. So if you have a healer's kit, then you roll two dice for each one.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. Sorry, bro.

[Speaker 3]
It didn't work. As long as it exceeds You'd have to roll one for you and me, I believe. So it didn't work on me, but roll it for yourself if you're using it for you as well.

[Speaker 1]
Improvised healing? Well, no. The result of improvised healing is doubled.

So you would have gotten 22. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so wait. That's taken into account here? Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
It succeeds.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so you get 16 plus how much left over?

[Speaker 3]
16.

[Speaker 2]
Which the leftover is temporary hit points.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's It's just the last that the person took.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So it's 22 to 16. Alright.

So it's another six. So six temporary hit points.

[Speaker 1]
And then you gain two actual hits for using that.

[Speaker 3]
16. Oh, beautiful.

[Speaker 4]
What's your status right now? Do you think a healing word would top you off? Eh, probably.

[Speaker 3]
I've got 20 hit points I'm missing at the moment.

[Speaker 2]
I'm missing quite a few. I'm missing nearly half of my hit points.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so yeah, I'll heal up Kibi then.

[Speaker 2]
But if there's someone who's missing more, then I'm good.

[Speaker 1]
It's about time for me to hop off here. You guys sit here one to one time. You guys slept tonight.

Would anybody be able to pick up part of this adventure tomorrow?

[Speaker 2]
Nope.

[Speaker 1]
The Hidden Bluff, yeah. Hidden Bluff is at noon central time. This will be tomorrow.

[Speaker 5]
I have a different game tomorrow, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I can't tomorrow.

[Speaker 1]
Surprisingly. If that's the case, what we'll do is if that's the case, what we'll do I have an idea. Okay.

Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna have you guys resolve this at noon basically. And when you guys are next able to pick up with these characters be able to go into the Resonance Seed which is a and that means you're able to...

These characters will be restricted, right? Time is passing in the game world as real life passes on, so get back to them ASAP. Or, you can have them call for rescue and see see try to get their bearings here.

Let's show you guys where you are on the overworld map.

[Speaker 5]
We're like two days ahead now of real time, right? Because we rested and then we had the six hour bout of unconsciousness.

[Speaker 1]
Right, but it's 10pm for this night, so you didn't quite go. Right. Unless you have like a last minute thing.

Nope.

[Speaker 2]
So what's the goal for the downtime? Is the goal to just survive? Okay, that's it.

Like, survive and get back to civilization. Got it.

[Speaker 1]
Well, just right now survive because you guys are very far away from civilization.

[Speaker 2]
So would downtime just be like walking in?

[Speaker 1]
Well, Dickory came here for a reason. He doesn't really want to leave it be. And if there is another resident seed in the area, then that's a potential mean of getting his that is a potential means of getting home.

He'd use that to teleport.

[Speaker 2]
Are there signs that we can look for to find him?

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yes. Like, we're searching stuff. Dickory is probably going to be the one to find the actual thing itself.

But what he's concerned with is not dying.

[Speaker 2]
So just keep him alive? Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So food, shelter. Think of it as an extended exploration challenge. And probably using the exploration features would be best for you.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. So Rowan will just be going survivalist then.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we've got food. A boar and a copperhead, apparently. And some doppelganger.

Yeah, I guess it did leave a it did leave a a copperhead.

[Speaker 1]
Which is alive, by the way. It didn't kill it?

[Speaker 3]
No, no, it caught it alive. Was the thing earlier. Now it's hanging out.

Because that thing's doppelganger's dead.

[Speaker 1]
And there's two people who can talk to animals here, as I recall. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Anybody actually playing one of the doppelgangers? Or were they just there?

[Speaker 1]
No, so what I had them do go back and forth, which did not work at all. I probably shouldn't have done this at all, actually. But basically, I would private message people who were playing the doppelgangers briefly.

I would introduce them in the party first, so that they would just kind of talk normally. And then I would tell them that they were playing the doppelganger.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I got very confused during that.

[Speaker 2]
I had fun, though.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it was fun.

[Speaker 1]
It was goofy. It was risky. Didn't pan out, but I'm glad you guys had fun.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that was entertaining.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then next session with these guys, if you guys are able to, is just dungeon crawl time. So I will see you guys later.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I might head off, too. Bye, everyone. Peace.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, have a good night.

[Speaker 3]
It's James. Holy moly. Nobody say anything.

[Speaker 7]
Hello. Hello. Oh, good evening.

[Speaker 5]
Select an R-Type feed, then select that R-Type's dedication feed using one of your class feed choices. Once you've taken the dedication feed, you can...

[Speaker 2]
Are you leveling, Mr. Mac?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it sounds like it's described backwards. So I need a dedication feed to start with an R-Type, is that correct?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, is that dedication of the R-Type?

[Speaker 2]
Technically, they're the same thing.

[Speaker 3]
Dedication is an... it can be a class dedication or a R-Type dedication. A dedication is an R-Type feed.

There are two types. There are the multi-class ones, which are just name of class, dedication. And then there is like all the specific ones, like Acrobat dedication.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, and do I select that from... And the very cool ones. Do I select that from R-Type feed?

[Speaker 3]
If you just... yeah, if you're looking at R-Type feeds and you click browse, it should have a list of every dedication.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a specific dedication you're going for?

[Speaker 5]
No, I'm trying to make sure that I'm looking at the correct ones to begin with.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, let's see. It's not Nethys that has a good... look, let me see if I can find it.

[Speaker 3]
The only restriction is you can't take a dedication of your main class.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Double up!

[Speaker 1]
They're also just not allowing the ones where you get your health per R-Type feed. I'll go in easy on those ones.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, which ones?

[Speaker 1]
So there's one where you get bonus health for each R-Type feed that you have. In that R-Type.

[Speaker 2]
What R-Type is that?

[Speaker 1]
There's a few of them.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. I guess I hadn't looked too closely at all of them, I just picked what was thematically appropriate.

[Speaker 1]
So it's like you can give your character an extra, I think it's like 60 health or something.

[Speaker 2]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
If you try to abuse it, right?

[Speaker 2]
Give that to Nova and she becomes unkillable.

[Speaker 1]
But I mean, you'd waste a lot of stuff doing it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's true. So I guess if it fits the character then yes, but you are, well, sacrificing a lot of feeds for that. For the characters I'm playing I have like a roadmap to which feeds I would like them to take.

Of course if something happens to them later I might change that, but it's just so I don't have to stress about it later.

[Speaker 3]
I haven't done that because if they die I'm gonna be sad.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see. That's, you know what? Good point, good point.

No, you see, the thing is it's too late for these characters, if any of them die I'll be very sad. So I'm like, yeah, might as well.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna go with Living Vessel.

[Speaker 3]
Why do I never click save token when I update it?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, what a mood. You're making a Living Vessel, ain't that fun? He's an occult!

[Speaker 5]
That must be... I already took Underworld Investigator. Oh, there are...

[Speaker 1]
So if we give someone an artifact like the Air Assignment of Benjahood, would that mean they get the free archetype? While they wear it? Or would they get that item because they have that archetype?

[Speaker 3]
I think typically... Well, typically it's a campaign thing where you're joining the Avengers and you plan on taking those feats. But there are some that I would consider giving for free, like that.

Not so much that one, but like Ghost. Ghost is pretty strong. Maybe like Zombie or Vampire, because they're pretty...

Ghost is pretty strong, but the other undead archetype ones aren't good. So if you were going to inflict that on a player, I would consider giving them for free.

[Speaker 2]
I did actually look at some of the undead ones and it's just like, oh yeah, your body is falling apart, you have to eat people. Great fun.

[Speaker 3]
Life sucks for you. Get used to it, idiot.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like, good job, you died.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I looked at the Lich and I don't think it would be worth a level 12 feat. It would be something cool to have as a free feat if you'd done it. But to actually choose it as a feat and give a level 12 feat up for something else for it?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think the Lich would have to be a reward for going through the Hoop and becoming a Lich. There aren't too many that I think like that, though. Maybe some of the lore-based ones.

I think there's one about cave worms or something, which would be a reward.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, is that the worm collar farmer thing?

[Speaker 3]
That sounds like it, yes.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Even though we're not playing with mythic rules, for fun I did take a little bit of a break. I did take a look at some of them and they're pretty entertaining to look at.

So, if you have free time, you can always read one of those.

[Speaker 3]
I've never really looked at the mythic rules.

[Speaker 2]
No, I meant like the mythic archetype stuff. I believe the mythic rules are free to just get. There's a PDF somewhere.

I'll have to look for it in my files.

[Speaker 1]
It's got another method.

[Speaker 2]
It is entertaining.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's either or for the free archetype. So you have either the free archetype or you have the mythic archetype. Free mythic archetype.

And they follow different rulings.

[Speaker 2]
Yes. I, again, did look at the rules and they were just like, oh yeah, this is usually like, if you're doing a campaign about it, then you can do it. Or it's a reward.

So your mythic level might not be the same as your level level.

[Speaker 3]
There are some archetypes that I'd give out as being part of a faction as well. The example in original Pathfinder, like in the setting, is Pathfinder Agent. If you were part of one of the schools in Simaid, there would be an equivalent of the Mungambian attendant dedication that I would like to make, but I've been lazy and haven't done that.

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying to find... oh, they're probably going to be under rare. How do I find the other feats for something that's in a specific dedication, like if I want to find Living Vessel?

[Speaker 3]
Like the high level ones?

[Speaker 5]
Living Vessel just says Feat 2. I don't know if it...

[Speaker 2]
You can... the Demiplane thing that I linked to, it lists all the feats in a row for you. Very convenient if you check voiceover flow.

[Speaker 3]
Living Vessel's kind of horrifying, Jamie.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that's why I said he's in a cult.

[Speaker 5]
I didn't say I'm in a cult.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, you were forced... something was forced upon you then, which is even worse. Because at least if you're in a cult, it's usually your choice.

[Speaker 5]
My former tree powers are just kind of, you know, coming along for the ride.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Wow, that is... that is...

wow.

[Speaker 1]
Someone's watching the Kikaiji Jensen anime. Or Naruto.

[Speaker 2]
That's some Bondi horror stuff.

[Speaker 3]
He actually just got worms once and never got rid of them, and now they're sort of part of him.

[Speaker 1]
Did you ever hear about that health fad? Or, like, the weight loss fad?

[Speaker 2]
Which one?

[Speaker 1]
The one that they were having tapeworms, like... Oh yeah, back in the... They were eating tapeworms to go in their stomach, so the tapeworms would eat the food, so they wouldn't count.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I did hear about that. I saw... well, I wasn't there when it was happening, but I did...

I have seen ads of it before. Just, like, online and stuff, or research.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Have you found the living vessel on Demiplane, James?

[Speaker 5]
I have, I have. There's no, um... Also, can you guys hear me alright?

I don't know if it's even going through the right microphone.

[Speaker 1]
It's a little soft. I've got you boosted to 200, I'm still struggling a little bit. And I just realized you're on the wrong map.

Alright, here we go.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you're clear.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, let me turn off the air.

[Speaker 3]
What characters are you two bringing?

[Speaker 2]
What level adventure is this?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, a dustable. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Um, I do want to level up the Doctor a bit. Alright, this is...

we are helping the merchant. Is this... are we going back to the cave where the bandits are, or is this now just an extension of the same merchant?

[Speaker 1]
It's a different one.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, thank you. That does help.

[Speaker 3]
I think I'll keep... There you go.

[Speaker 2]
I think I'll keep Levent at level 1 for now, so that he can join in any level 1 parties.

[Speaker 1]
Same thing. So, you should have a pop-up, and a couple of flies that can pop around. That's fun, I love that.

[Speaker 2]
It was calling for my attention. He wants us to kill these people.

[Speaker 5]
So it seems.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Guess the Doctor's staying in the Hidden Bluff, then. Oh, it disappeared.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, thank you. Alright, thank you. I have read.

Very good. There's something that says the Rebirth with no elaboration. Is that on purpose?

[Speaker 1]
Nah, I think I accidentally made a second page. Didn't mean to.

[Speaker 2]
All is well.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's blank, so you won't be able to see anything anyway.

[Speaker 2]
No, I did see anything past the token, and the Rebirth.

[Speaker 1]
I was trying to set it up so I could unlock pages as you went through. Ooh. Oh, that's cool.

Yeah, the Session Reports, that sort of stuff. I thought, who's going to read Session Reports? So I could put a bit of information about previous things.

But I don't think I set it up right.

[Speaker 2]
It's alright, it's alright. Still a very cool idea.

[Speaker 5]
There is a way to do inline GM text. So you can make it so that stuff isn't revealed. Unless you're a GM and you click Reveal.

I like it.

[Speaker 1]
I know about the GM part, and I have some in there. But I didn't know I could reveal that. Forgot to mention, she'll still need about another 5 minutes.

If anyone needs any snacks or a bathroom before we start. What is my intimidation?

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, Landy, is that a new icon for Sierra?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, intimidation?

[Speaker 2]
That's cool. Where did you get the art from?

[Speaker 3]
Sierra's just based off X23 from Marvel Comics. So it's just like an alternate cover or something.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. If you want to inflict intimidation, take the fear spell via spells. If you want the same effect, but magic.

[Speaker 7]
Mechanican.

[Speaker 2]
You know, Mechanican is so cool that we can't even click on this sheet. It says, you do not have sufficient permission to view the sheet for this actor. Secrets, secrets indeed.

[Speaker 3]
You're both level 2, you'll carry whatever level... Oh, it depends actually. Who are you bringing?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to decide on.

[Speaker 3]
Mechanic's level 2, he'll carry whatever level 1 I take. I'm gonna flip a coin. 1 for Sierra, 2 for Maya.

[Speaker 5]
The number of additional skills equal to 4 plus your intelligence modifier.

[Speaker 3]
I am a rogue.

[Speaker 2]
Can you remind me which Spider-Man Maya's based off of?

[Speaker 3]
Night Spider. She's in like one comic in Into the Spider-Verse.

[Speaker 2]
Ah.

[Speaker 3]
It's what if Black Cat was Spider-Man, basically.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like I must have read it a while ago. Thank you, I will look it up later. It also depends on who Frogetha's bringing.

I might have to play eenie meenie miney moe at this point.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, hello! Hello! Hey, Frogetha.

[Speaker 2]
How you doing? Doing alright.

[Speaker 3]
I like your frog clan tag.

[Speaker 2]
Yes!

[Speaker 5]
It's plus my intelligence modifier, so I get another 2 skills.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, what are we doing? We're stopping bandits. 5 gold per head, so presumably we are killing them.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, beautiful.

[Speaker 1]
I was thinking like 5 gold for each person that signs up.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, that's what you mean. I thought you meant per head. Oh, that's better.

It's not 5 per head of people we defeat, it's 5 per person who joins. Which makes more sense, and I'm relieved, actually.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, 5 gold is a steep price for someone's head.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, exactly. That's what I was like, wow, okay.

[Speaker 3]
They're actually necromancers that we're working for.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Landi, I forgot to say, I really like the banner you have on. Did, um...

[Speaker 3]
My banner? Yes, the banner. Oh, yeah, I'll do that.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it's very nice. You got the profiles? Mhm.

Imagine having Nitro. Expert.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes I think about adding up how much money I've spent on it, and then I get scared.

[Speaker 2]
Honestly, don't look at it too closely, it's fine.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, don't think about it too much.

[Speaker 3]
Then I think about how much I've spent on League of Legends, and it overshadows anything else in my life that I fear.

[Speaker 4]
About Call of Duty?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, man. I did one other thing for you, check out how much estimated your stream account's worth. And I'm like, oh, I don't want to talk about things anymore.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, who should I bring? Kibi's currently dying with malaria. Susudio hasn't gotten to do anything.

Well, Susudio has done one thing.

[Speaker 1]
Revealing true names. I always suggest to make sure there's someone that has at least some support or potions.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, yeah, well, unfortunately, healing hurts me, so I don't... What do you mean healing hurts you? Do healing potions hurt me as well?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Oh, no. No, it's just vitality spells or features, I think.

[Speaker 2]
What does healing hurt you? Undead.

[Speaker 3]
Undead have the negative healing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so things like the half spell will heal. Void energy heals, and positive energy, which normally heals, will kill you.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so how do I heal during battle?

[Speaker 3]
There's not really that many things that will hurt you instead of healing. The soothe spell's still really good for healing undead. Treat wounds, I think, still just works on you.

So, like, battle medicine, things like that still work. It's really just the heal spell. Do you need a feat for that?

Sorry?

[Speaker 1]
Do you need a feat for that?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I don't have battlefield medicine. Someone else does good for you.

[Speaker 4]
Dude, my brain is screeching non-fucking-stop. Oh my god. Gonna lose my fucking mind.

[Speaker 9]
Sorry?

[Speaker 4]
You're being plagued by the bird? Yes. He's mad that my mom is gone for the day, so he's screeching non-stop.

Bye.

[Speaker 2]
Well, best of luck with the bird. Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, if you bring Siren along, I will be able to make people off-guard for you.

[Speaker 4]
Can I bring both Siren and Susudio? Greedy. I mean, I don't have to.

I can just bring Siren.

[Speaker 2]
I'm joking. I'm kidding. If you can, it would be nice to have more characters.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you want to bring more characters, that's no problem.

[Speaker 4]
I'm kind of low on people. Susudio's a monk, so he doesn't really care about money. I still have to finish making my goblin.

I think I just need to get her stuff or his stuff. I haven't decided yet. You know what?

Arsonist Goblin's not going to have a gender. Nobody's going to know. Huzzah.

Goblin's just going to be Goblin.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so if the others are fine with someone bringing an extra character so there's a support, if there's one that you want to play, you want to make sure you have some support, I'm fine with that.

[Speaker 4]
I have exactly one healing character. What do we have right now? Because I have...

Do I even have spells for her?

[Speaker 3]
We have an investigator and a rogue. Who are you bringing?

[Speaker 4]
You know what, Susudio? Sorry, buddy. Can you put Susudio back?

I can't drag him. Oh, there we go. Never mind.

I got him. You know what? The siblings are coming along because Karas is kind of...

She's a spellcaster.

[Speaker 2]
Nice. I have one healing character but that's at level 3 and so... It might debalance a bit.

[Speaker 3]
Look, I'm okay with getting double XP.

[Speaker 2]
Fine.

[Speaker 3]
Now that's up to the...

[Speaker 1]
Like I said, if people want to play a character but you want one, if someone wants to bring an extra character for support, for the healing support, because that's generally advised, I'm more than happy with that.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Should I put the doctor back and only play Kamon or...? I bought some additional ammunition.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And there we go, we have six characters.

[Speaker 1]
Six characters?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, if I'm doubling up. Should I only bring one, is what I'm asking?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, only bring one extra for support.

[Speaker 2]
You are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Should I bring... So I have two characters on there right now.

Should I only take one character?

[Speaker 1]
Well, that's the same. So everyone plays one and then if someone wants to bring an extra character, so there's a support character for healing, I'm more than happy with that.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And Frogatha, you're bringing the support character? If somebody else has an actual healer, please bring an actual healer, because I'm not an actual healer.

[Speaker 3]
Sierra's trained in medicine and has healing tools.

[Speaker 5]
Who?

[Speaker 3]
Sierra, my rogue. Okay, awesome. But she's only a plus three to the roll, so there's like a good chance we get stonewalled for like an hour trying to heal.

[Speaker 2]
Does any of your characters have healing spells, Frogatha?

[Speaker 5]
Saris has soothe. Oh, then it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
I can... If you have soothe, that's a really good spell.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but I think I can... Where do I have soothe at?

[Speaker 3]
Do you not have soothe? Oh, never mind then.

[Speaker 4]
I thought I did, but I... Where did it go? What the fuck?

[Speaker 7]
It disappeared.

[Speaker 4]
I swear I had it. What the fuck? I'm so confused.

Saris was just like, fuck healing. I swear I had it. How many first level spells am I supposed to have as a bard?

Let's see. Bard... Like three?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, at level two you should have three.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, so everyone's decided what characters they're bringing? Everyone's all good? Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Does nobody have a... Does nobody have a bard?

Or not a bard, a healer? I... Oh, no.

My healer is my bard.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. I think Para is our resident healer, so... I'll buy some healing potions.

[Speaker 3]
That's a good idea.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, I can finish making Gravekeeper Enid, but...

[Speaker 5]
It's so funny that she's like, forced to heal and brought back to life.

[Speaker 4]
She's not dead quite yet.

[Speaker 3]
We have healers tools. Like, if we have to heal, we just have to retreat, you know?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's reasonable.

[Speaker 3]
The game's pretty playable without, like, a spellcaster that heals. If we have healing tools.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, as long as someone has, like, battle mercenaries for, like, emergencies. So you have a potion or two to, say, stop them from dying.

[Speaker 2]
I brought four potions. I do have versatile vials, so...

[Speaker 5]
Oh yeah, sounds like we're good there.

[Speaker 3]
But you're an alchemist. We'll be fine.

[Speaker 2]
Not an alchemist. Not an alchemist. I took the dedication feat.

[Speaker 3]
So you're an alchemist, is what you're saying. Yeah, you're an alchemist.

[Speaker 2]
I like mine, jeez. Like a half-alchemist, if anything.

[Speaker 1]
So, just in case I don't think Froglet was here... You see there was a notification listed on some of the tabs in some pubs. You know, about someone seeking some help.

So, adventurers wanted, you know... Would you like to read it in your own voice? One of the local merchants has advised that his caravans, as they're doing supply runs in different little outlying areas for resources, have been getting attacked by bandits.

And they're seeking someone to help ease his issues by releasing the pressure of these bandits. And so when you inquire about the tavern, you know, they'll guide you to one of the... It looks like a quite fancily dressed person, which is a servant for...

Faros. God, Lord Faros. Merchant Lord Faros.

And he invites you to join the expedition for some other like-minded adventurers who are after some easy coin. And if you'd like to introduce yourselves, as you're gathering up together. Anyone like to introduce his character?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'm a cat in here.

[Speaker 7]
I will.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, someone else do it. Not it.

[Speaker 1]
I'll introduce myself once, you know.

[Speaker 5]
And he's, you know, rather large, balding at the crown.

[Speaker 1]
If you have any questions, you can also ask him.

[Speaker 5]
Just trying to figure out exactly where all these damned bandits are and why we have a council member coming with us. Oh wait, no, we don't have karma.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'm, uh... Let's see. Who goes first?

[Speaker 1]
Start at the top of Discord, Fragatha.

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 1]
You're at the top of Discord. Make it nice and easy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh boy. Um... Charis?

She's just Charis. Everybody knows her. She's a bard.

Um... Yeah. She's a bard.

Former smuggler. And her brother is Siren. Also a former smuggler.

He's a little bit stupid. Just a little bit. Um...

He's a rogue. Yeah, that's pretty much all I can say. He died once.

[Speaker 2]
Not better.

[Speaker 1]
Zombie. Memes of zombies in a town.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm next. Alright, um... Dr. Basia is a wizard. He decided to join because he realised he had been staying in the Hidden Bluff for like weeks upon time. The last couple of weeks have been mostly like investigating around it, telling folks how not to die in it, and mapping it out. After a bit, he was just like, I need to go out and do something.

He's out helping this merchant folk. Usually, though, his research is based on immortality slash not-death, fundamentally. But this is a nice jaunt, so he doesn't...

Mentally stimulating, lest he lose his mind or something. He is out here.

[Speaker 1]
Out best way to deter death is finding out how it happens.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, it's less on how it happens, it's more on making sure no one can die. Almost died one time, hated it so much that he was like, never again. No one would like this.

No one is allowed to do that again. So he's researching how to stop that. It's so nice to see Dr. Basia again. I am glad you enjoy his presence.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and James.

[Speaker 5]
Already introduced myself.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
I will never be doing so again. Ever.

[Speaker 2]
We love the introduction, don't worry.

[Speaker 3]
Fiera is a human woman. She has a bestial look about her, though, I guess. Not literally, she is raised by wolves type deal.

You can see the glisten of her claws through her gloves and shoes. She sometimes looks like she's thinking of something to say, but she most often doesn't say anything.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm not sure if someone said they were non-healing friendly, if you want to make sure the party is aware of it, things like that nature. Or how you'd explain that to your party members.

[Speaker 4]
Put him out of the thing, he's at home. He doesn't really have a home, but he's wandering. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And so the agent there, he's like, oh, thank you adventurers for taking up this offer. So first, he's magnanimously offered to help aid this council and the city in their needs by helping remove these men at pressure. Of his own good free will and at his own cost.

We thank you for taking up this issue. And I'll be able to provide you information about the attack. And then once you provide proof of the demise of the bandits, we shall give you a reward.

And then he'll advise you about on the pathways, roughly the sections of where the bandits like to attack from or a particular area. And is there any other questions you'd like to ask?

[Speaker 2]
Would you prefer them to be... Wouldn't you prefer them to be captured so you can get more information out of them?

[Speaker 1]
Well, if you'd like to bring them back alive, we'd certainly appreciate that.

[Speaker 2]
Splendid.

[Speaker 1]
You know, but if it's just like most bandit outfits, I don't think there's a network. So as long as they're raised there, as long as the problem's resolved, I don't particularly mind how it's done.

[Speaker 2]
Onwards?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, no problems. So anything else you want to ask before you head off?

[Speaker 2]
Is there any pattern to who or what they attack? Are these enough to find?

[Speaker 1]
We have a rough idea where they might be located. But we have our guards and we don't really have a surplus for people to spend to go out and solve this problem without disrupting our own profits.

[Speaker 5]
I would like to give you an investigational source. Indeed.

[Speaker 1]
Bandits are where they stay. Bandits? Yeah, so he'll point roughly on the map to the east, roughly about where the attacks are taking place.

There's been a few different attacks and he'll point on the map. And he'll be like, around here, here and here. You know, it's about a triangulation of attacks.

So he roughly knows where that area is. Might need to do a little bit of investigation to try to track them down further. When you get there to get more precise information.

But they have a general idea.

[Speaker 5]
I see, I see.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I do suppose we should be on our way then. Thank you very much. We appreciate your information greatly.

[Speaker 1]
Not a problem. And, you know, he'll indicate on the map roughly whereabouts the attacks are being located. There's a couple of...

it's not exactly the same spot, so there's quite a bit of distance between the different attacks. But you have a rough idea of where you can start searching. It's a couple of hours away from town, so it's not incredibly far.

It'll probably take you the day just to, you know, half day there, half day back sort of thing. But he guides you to the rough area. And you get the no problems.

If someone would like to do a survival check or some kind of check to help track down where these bandits might have come from.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
I don't have a compass.

[Speaker 2]
Oh god. You don't need to know which way is north. I mean, we're still in town, so we could get one before we set off.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Alright, let me look at my shop. My...

shop.

[Speaker 2]
Why do I have 60 gold? What the fuck? Well, I suppose you haven't spent it.

[Speaker 5]
You're not one of the bandits, are you?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, nothing of the sort.

[Speaker 7]
I'm the servant of a merchant.

[Speaker 4]
Bandit? No. What is this?

[Speaker 2]
The doctor just gives you a side eye and doesn't comment past that.

[Speaker 3]
Um, does McCannon have survival trained?

[Speaker 7]
McCannon...

[Speaker 2]
My survival's a plus one.

[Speaker 5]
No, I have nature trained. I was actually rather poor in terms of survival. Usually asking...

[Speaker 4]
Plus six to survival? Do you want me to go?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, please do.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I was looking, but I can't figure out how the hell to do this.

[Speaker 1]
The caravans have definitely picked up speed. You see there's like a little bruising mark in the mud that's dried up. And you see the tracks are pointing a little bit to the south.

But you can further investigate further in the scene if you'd like.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
I will investigate a bit. Hm? Um...

Well, Mr. McCannon, you might want to... With your nature, you can also help a lot.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I can help with nature. Okay. If you all insist.

[Speaker 7]
I have bullets.

[Speaker 4]
Oh no. And I have bought bullets before I left.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome.

[Speaker 1]
Sick. Uh... Yes?

Nature check.

[Speaker 2]
Can you see quite clear?

[Speaker 1]
Judging from the terrain, you do notice... It's not really a particularly great ambush spot. There's not really a big hilly area nearby.

You don't really get too much from it, though. The ground's pretty soft, so it's pretty hard to get good traction to spear off. But that's about it.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Did McCannon's nature check get to anything?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that was the nature check, sorry. So you know that they've headed south with the survival check for the tracking. But gathering more information, glistening more information from the scene...

Nothing really from that nature check. If other people would like to roll a check on some spot? Yeah?

You notice the scenes of the battle, you get a bit more clearer details with the deception check. You can tell that they've attacked from the high advantage, and they've waited particularly until they've gotten to that lower spot to attack. You do notice that some of the arrows that are being missed in the background...

They are quite different from the arrows that are shot by the guards.

[Speaker 2]
So, look around...

[Speaker 1]
If you'd like to do a recall knowledge, I can provide you more information about that.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, I'll do that. Thank you. What on earth is recall knowledge?

[Speaker 1]
You mean the basic macro action?

[Speaker 7]
Ah. Let's see...

[Speaker 2]
Here we go.

[Speaker 7]
Hm.

[Speaker 2]
Give me a second. Recall knowledge. Let me roll.

I suppose I'd use survival for this, which is a bit shoddy, but...

[Speaker 1]
Recall knowledge should give you the option to choose once you've done it, and it's a blind roll.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, okay, so I can't use the... Hold on, let me just drag this guy onto the screen then. There we go.

Yeah, here we go.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. You can tell the difference that some of these arrows that have been attacked are partially goblin arrows.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Or very crudely made, generally used by some of the lesser-developed races, such as the goblins. It looks pretty crude. You get a little bit of an idea that there's something on the arrows.

But you're not too sure what. Maybe some poison.

[Speaker 2]
Probably poison, yes. I'll check it with survival if I die. Actually, no, wait, that's foolish.

I'll ask one of the people who... That would be excellent.

[Speaker 4]
Let's see, what does he do? Okay, alright, he doesn't lick it, that's for sure. Haha.

[Speaker 2]
Much appreciated.

[Speaker 1]
You notice it is some snake adder venom.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
So a pretty common poison. It's not too strong, but it can be deadly in certain situations.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, okay. Can I take this arrow and use it?

[Speaker 1]
The poison wouldn't be any use anymore.

[Speaker 4]
So I can lick it.

[Speaker 2]
That would be inadvisable, my fair friend. It would have some trace amounts.

[Speaker 5]
Contract is one thing, congestion is a whole other ballgame, you know. Exactly. That's what we're saying.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. We still need to do a check to see where the goblin footprints lead off to, yes?

[Speaker 1]
It heads towards the south.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, off that way then.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. And... That's all fine, and have you got your...

activity icon, exploration activity set?

[Speaker 3]
I can do that.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to have Siryn sneaking just in case there's an ambush.

[Speaker 1]
You notice as you travel across, there is a bit of blood.

[Speaker 4]
Taking a look around, keeping an eye out.

[Speaker 1]
It's obviously dried, as the injuries were days old.

[Speaker 2]
Does it lead anywhere, or is it sort of like an indistinct splatter?

[Speaker 1]
It's definitely headed in a direction, yeah. It's along the path that you're following.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. I will tell everyone of this unfortunate information, and advise them to maybe have a weapon on hand. Make sure it's drawn at least.

[Speaker 3]
I can't sneak attack with my claws until level 2, so I have to drop throwing knives.

[Speaker 1]
You notice that as you travel across the path, there seems to be a spot where there is a large amount of blood just brought everywhere, and a little bit of a clearing. And then after that, the path continues on, you can see some footprints, there's less footprints, but there is no more blood dripping.

[Speaker 2]
Are there any bodies?

[Speaker 1]
Not that you can see.

[Speaker 2]
Any bit of scuffle that would stop blood, for example? Evidence of someone being picked up?

[Speaker 1]
There is indication of the foliage being ruffled and broken apart, which is something that happened in an area. I'll get an investigation check if you'd like more.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I shall do that.

[Speaker 4]
Investigation check. I guess it'd be perception?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, that makes more sense.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I'm thinking of bloody 5A.

[Speaker 2]
I was just confused. I'm going to see if people are better at looking than me. Perception.

[Speaker 1]
You're looking at what appears to be a bit of a scuffle, but not much that you can really get a good idea of what's happened.

[Speaker 2]
I'll ask my companions to perhaps look a bit deeper for me. So I'll point out the blood and how it stops, but... Be like, well, I haven't been able to find anything past this.

Do you mind taking a look yourself?

[Speaker 3]
Sierra will try.

[Speaker 1]
Judging by the way the blood sprays, she knows there seems to be at least four different things that were involved in this incident.

[Speaker 3]
Sierra just holds up four of her fingers.

[Speaker 4]
No manticores, are there? No manticore tracks?

[Speaker 5]
I hope not.

[Speaker 4]
A tad bit traumatized.

[Speaker 2]
Well, that they would. But Sierra did say four things, and it's...

[Speaker 5]
That they will. Terrible creatures.

[Speaker 2]
That they are. Sierra did say that there were four creatures, though not one creature made of four, so it is likely it is not that.

[Speaker 3]
Sierra nods in agreeance with that.

[Speaker 2]
One of you could check to see if you can tell anything further from it.

[Speaker 5]
Believe I will.

[Speaker 1]
Are we still looking at the arrows themselves, or...? No, no, so you've left the scene of the fight for the cartway, and you're on the way following the tracks. You've been following a blood trail and footprints, and this is where the blood trail has stopped, and the footprints have continued.

[Speaker 5]
I'd like to make an occultism check to see if there's... Maybe a recall knowledge, actually. See if I can recall anything about this lovely location.

See if I... Maybe if this matches an MO. Some nasty critter.

Where's my recall knowledge? Where are you, you son of a bitch? It's around here.

I know it's around here. Is it exploration recall knowledge? What the hell?

[Speaker 2]
If you go into the macros in encounter, it should be on the... Yeah. Don't forget to select your token, though, otherwise Foundry will yell at you.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but I don't see a...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hey, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. You notice that... Well, most animals, if they do devour something, there's normally some remains of a carcass.

There's just nothing here. There's only the trails of blood. There's no bones, no flesh.

Not even a morsel of scraps left.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, can you say that again?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, so there's no remains. There's only the blood from the battle. There's no bits of bones, no morsels of flesh scattered anywhere.

The corpse is gone. Huh.

[Speaker 4]
I don't like this.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's not a likeable thing.

[Speaker 2]
It does have some unfortunate implications. Either they were eaten completely, like Swallowed Whole, or the spider. Yes, or simply kidnapped, which...

Or necromancy. Or that, yes. At this point, it might be more pleasant than a stink that can eat a person whole, so...

[Speaker 5]
Shall we continue? I will... What do the footprints look like?

Are they still like, people-sized? What are we looking at here?

[Speaker 1]
You notice they're small-sized, from a small creature.

[Speaker 5]
Small-sized, so a small creature that can eat something whole. Or the small creatures that didn't... Or it's not an animal, so it didn't leave a carcass.

Or it is an animal, and it swallowed it whole.

[Speaker 1]
If you recall knowledge, while Sierra's pointed out there are at least four creatures, as well as the creature that was affected, there can be at least six.

[Speaker 2]
Exciting news. Can they tell what animals they are, or creatures? Are they all the same humanoid-type tracks?

[Speaker 1]
They're wearing shoes, so it's hard. It's not leaving any footprints in regards to that. Different kinds of shoes, which is, upon further investigation, has indicated there is more variety than expected.

[Speaker 4]
The tracks previous, when we were looking at the tracks from the previous bloodstain on the floor, are there less of them now? There are less footprints.

[Speaker 1]
After the bloodstain on the floor, there's obviously less.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe they're just bringing their dead with them. I'd bring your bodies with me if I could carry them. Obviously, if you fell, like we did with Klink.

Reassuring.

[Speaker 2]
Do these tracks lead anywhere? May we follow them, if they do?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, you're more than welcome to follow.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. I am glad to hear that. Which of your characters is saying this?

Rogatha, about dragging our bodies along. Siren. Good to hear that, Siren.

There's nothing to it but to continue following on.

[Speaker 1]
As you follow tracks, you start to notice scratches, claw marks, weird happenings around the trees. And as you follow them closer and closer, you start to notice the scatter remains of bones.

[Speaker 2]
Exciting, exciting news.

[Speaker 1]
Appears to be a mix of humanoids, animals, a variety of different humanoids. Some of them are more easily to tell apart than others. Humanoids, kobolds, goblins.

Sub-humanoids, it would probably be hard to tell the difference between a human and an elf. Not so much orcs. But yeah, there's a variation of different pockets.

[Speaker 4]
And I'm still hiding. I don't know what I rolled for it, but... Okay.

[Speaker 3]
We don't roll until initiative with avoid notice. It doesn't matter until there's an encounter.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, so we find the pile of bones. Is there any tracks leading to and from it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you notice there's a big pile there and it scatters towards Warrantorough. Past the rock.

[Speaker 2]
Can I pick up the bones?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, free bones!

[Speaker 4]
Free bones! There's none on them.

[Speaker 1]
No, not yet. How are you holding these bones? There is, like, a lot of bones.

[Speaker 2]
I put it in my handy backpack that is conveniently there. Or I just strap them to my bird. Honestly, I might just do that.

Here we go. I strap them to my familiar. I'm like, good luck!

[Speaker 3]
Is there a stone wall behind these trees? Is it possible to navigate through the trees or do we have to go around? You should be able to navigate through them.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Unless I have set up that wrong incorrectly, I believe.

[Speaker 3]
There's a wall.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's the rock. So there's a rock here, there's a rock...

[Speaker 3]
I see a black square here, but I physically can't move past here.

[Speaker 2]
Worst comes to worst, I can put the bones down somewhere else. But it would be good for evidence, I suppose, and any necromancy that may happen in the future. On we go!

[Speaker 1]
As you open up, you notice that it goes into a much larger area. Up along here. You notice there is a large pile of refuse, quite a lot of bones.

There is quite a lot of blood, like that area is soaked with blood.

[Speaker 2]
I'll send my bird forwards just in case there's any unfortunate happenings. Investigating the bone pile first.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it looks like there's a pile of bones.

[Speaker 2]
Nothing else in it? Alright.

[Speaker 1]
No, if you click on it, you should be able to open it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! Hmm. I'm going to have to go closer to investigate that, aren't I?

Actually, you know what? No. We're going to use this thing, so I don't have to get too close to it.

And I'm going to try to identify it. Is there a specific thing for identify, or is it just pick a thing?

[Speaker 1]
It is an alchemical item. So, did you say your character is an alchemist?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah? They would roughly know it is probably alchemist fire.

[Speaker 7]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
It's common enough that you'd be able to know that off the top of your head if you're an alchemist.

[Speaker 2]
Well, three cheers for the alchemist thing. The bird can leave that there as they go investigate here. The table and such.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, can I get a blind perception to check?

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
You notice there's jugs, crates, faces, things like you can store goods like wine, edibles, just random sorts of shiny stuff. I think there's some mouldy bread on the table. As mentioned before, there's a refuse pit here, piles of bones everywhere.

Around this area here is especially blood-soaked.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. Well, companions, it does seem we might have some form of cannibals on our hands.

[Speaker 1]
And I'm not sure you can see too well, but there's a tent there.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. I'll take the alchemist fire, but I'll leave the bones. Far too many bones to carry right now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So, as you go to get the alchemist fire, you should see... Ah!

Hey.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, well. I'm going to, seeing this...

[Speaker 6]
The trap.

[Speaker 2]
I should have seen that coming. Honestly. Both in and out of character, I should have seen that coming.

[Speaker 1]
Can I grab a thievery check, please?

[Speaker 2]
A what check? Thievery. Oh, thievery.

Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
It's just in the chat.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. Can I re-roll that?

[Speaker 1]
If you want to hero point it, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, because I'm a little afraid I might blow up dramatically. Jesus Christ! How is it worse?

[Speaker 8]
How did it get worse? Is that allowed?

[Speaker 1]
As you go to grab it... Sorry, I think if I roll this one now... Yeah, okay.

As you go to grab it, the hand that's grasping the vial pops the flask, exploding the vial. The alchemist vial. And I'll get a reflex save, please.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah!

[Speaker 1]
That's so good.

[Speaker 2]
How on earth did I... Yeah, okay. How did it become much worse?

[Speaker 1]
I'll get everyone to roll initiative, please. And then, so, if you roll the 1d8, you should take that damage.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, well, let me... How?

[Speaker 3]
Wait, is the rolling initiative, or just the doctor? Yep, rolling initiative. Dorky.

[Speaker 2]
Whoops. First of all, rude. Second of all, yeah, deserved.

[Speaker 5]
I should have seen that. I drank the second token on, I apologize.

[Speaker 3]
I can't unsplit, he's had a... His forehead got so big it was like mitosis. It's splitting time.

[Speaker 5]
I was going to pull off that chronoskipper thing.

[Speaker 4]
Gave him a whole new... A whole new mechanic. Mitosis, you know?

[Speaker 5]
It's going to be very annoying for people when I make them read a different game. When a mechanic gets knocked unconscious. And I make them read, like, alright, you have to...

There's this zine game that I published, Seven Willows, but it's in the same world. So you're going to have to just go ahead and read that first. And then you'll understand Rana's subplot and, you know, everything else.

It's like me giving Froggath fucking astral tides. Like, can you tell me about the lore of your world? I'm like, here's this book that I published in 2019.

[Speaker 4]
I enjoyed reading it. Yeah, I enjoyed reading it. Forgot most of it, but I did enjoy it.

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah. That's all I could ask for.

[Speaker 4]
I am a pothead, so... I tend to forget things.

[Speaker 8]
It's very enjoyable. I like the world build.

[Speaker 2]
Especially how everything is... Oh, that's 11. Yes.

Warming on fire.

[Speaker 1]
Now, how do I set it so it's all in order again? Do I... I don't reset initiative, do I?

[Speaker 3]
What order? Sorry?

[Speaker 1]
Is it already in order?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the initiative automatically places us in order. Thank goodness.

[Speaker 1]
Great, perfect. So, Siren's turn. You notice that...

As Dr. Backrow's picked up the flask, it has exploded on him. Or, them. And you notice the bone piles are starting to rise.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, they are necromancers! Dammit. What do I have?

Um...

[Speaker 1]
And then I'll just confirm, who has the bones piled onto them?

[Speaker 2]
It's the bird that was carrying them, but... They are in my inventory, so... You can go either way.

Because familiars don't have inventories, so I just put it in mine. Though I did say, and I quote, I'm strapping it to the bird.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Strapping it? Great. Uh...

[Speaker 6]
Sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Is there anything for me to shoot right now?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you do notice that some of the bones are starting to move. Mainly this one.

[Speaker 4]
I don't quite have anything to do... So, can I do some kind of... Recall knowledge?

Will that help me here?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, where can I find that? Recall knowledge... I can also delay your turn.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can delay your turn too, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'll delay my turn then.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Because I'm pretty sure everybody else can see. I don't have to yell about it or anything.

[Speaker 1]
You can use the option on the right of your turn to delay it. And then you can choose where you want to be delayed.

[Speaker 4]
I don't see that.

[Speaker 1]
On the turn tracker? Yeah. Should be like an hourglass?

[Speaker 5]
The combat needs to be started, and then that menu will pop up.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, alright. Cool. Delay...

[Speaker 5]
I have the same problem. I always forget to start it. I always forget to start it.

[Speaker 4]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Uh, anyone speak Goblin?

[Speaker 2]
Let me check. Hold on, party languages. Nobody speaks Goblin.

[Speaker 5]
Anyone speak Necro?

[Speaker 2]
The languages that everyone speaks is Common, Aclo, Diabolic, Draconic, Elven, Fae, and Jotun.

[Speaker 1]
Can you see this weird... kind of partially looking rodent... Goblin...

just... shriek out something... and starts to charge.

[Speaker 8]
I...

[Speaker 4]
Can I imagine, you know the Furbies? From like, I guess the 90s up until like the 2010s? That's how I imagine Goblin speaking.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no! I... accidentally...

ended combat instead of ended turn?

[Speaker 4]
Oh no!

[Speaker 1]
XP time! Wow, that is... that is horrible, I'm so sorry!

It's okay!

[Speaker 3]
That's okay, you just start a new combat and you can go back up and set everyone's initiative to what they were before.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Everybody go ahead and re-add yourselves to the initiative. I was 11.

[Speaker 4]
I was... Siren was 28. I don't remember what Charis was, and I don't really care where you put her.

But I know Siren was like 28, and he was delayed after the second Goblin, or after the first Goblin was attacking.

[Speaker 5]
We could also all just re-roll, if you prefer that. Is it okay if we just re-roll?

[Speaker 2]
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

[Speaker 5]
It's such a pain in the ass to do all of them at the same time. I went to the same place anyways, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
That's looking roughly the same.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Oh wow.

[Speaker 9]
Writing it down.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Yeah, and you said Siris was skipping?

[Speaker 4]
No, Siren was, but Charis is not. Is there anything in my sight that I can shoot right now?

[Speaker 1]
Potentially that one. And that one.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, there's a Goblin! Okay.

[Speaker 2]
That's the thing that's yelling and none of us can understand.

[Speaker 7]
It is Shrieking.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna phase-bolt, did I? No, I didn't. Doop.

I'm gonna phase-bolt him. Boop. Oh, okay.

Uh, I'm gonna phase-bolt him. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, excellent work.

[Speaker 3]
Poor Goblin hasn't done anything and you're killing him for trying to warn us about zombies. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well. You didn't speak our language.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
It's not- I don't know how to- I hit roll damage, how do I make it critical?

[Speaker 3]
It spells the DM, just says to apply double. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, was the first one a crit fail?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, no, the first one was- oh yeah, it was a critical miss.

[Speaker 1]
And that only has...

[Speaker 4]
Two? And then the second one was a crit hit.

[Speaker 3]
Isn't it two actions to cause that spell?

[Speaker 4]
Is it two actions?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, nevermind, ignore that. Um, my next action will be... Can I cast and have a weapon in my hand?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I believe you need at least one freehand cast.

[Speaker 3]
Nope.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
You can have two weapons and still cause spells.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
They're removed.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, huzzah. All right.

[Speaker 3]
Broke his spells.

[Speaker 4]
I'll just use my gun. And then I'll use my... No, okay, that'll be my third.

All right. I'll shoot him. Really loudly.

Okay. And then that is my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Perfect.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, whoops. Dammit.

[Speaker 1]
You notice the second one starts to charge up. And without having to open the door, this one is able to run out and strike you with his... He's gonna run out and try to bite you.

And I believe you can see that. Don't tell me I'm wrong.

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, perfect. It runs out, shrieking. Runs out and latches onto your leg.

Nah. Nah. And I'll get a...

DC 15 fort save too, please.

[Speaker 2]
Fort save?

[Speaker 1]
Fort save? It should be on the... Can you see the...

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes, yes. I did fail that, I presume.

[Speaker 7]
Perfect. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh. Okay, and then... So do I take...

The paralyzed.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
So any... Oh, you're not enough, are you? Any non-living elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must proceed a DC 15 fort save or become paralyzed.

It can attempt a new check at the end of each of its turns, and the DC can increase by one on each save.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, zero this time. Okay. I'm just gonna go for the same dude.

And he is going, actually... Yeah, you know what? Oh, let me reset my health.

I haven't gotten hit, have I?

[Speaker 7]
No.

[Speaker 4]
Reset my health? Okay. I'm gonna have him move up...

Right here. And he's going to... I'm still a little iffy on how the...

Dual wielding works.

[Speaker 1]
So it's just attack as normal, it's just that you suffer a much lesser...

[Speaker 4]
Well, I have... I have... This.

Double slice. Make two strikes with one... One each.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, so that's a two-action one. And so you basically... You do the attack, and it basically helps to mitigate any...

Damage resistance that they have.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, and the second one... Is that at the same time? So is that one strike and then a map?

[Speaker 1]
I believe it's the...

[Speaker 4]
Or is that just one strike altogether? Two strikes altogether?

[Speaker 1]
Both strikes are the same map, so your bonus map, but it counts as a map. So if you do a third attack, you're gonna suffer the... Big penalty.

And so that's one hit.

[Speaker 4]
And that will be you up, his turn.

[Speaker 1]
It shrieks and pain and glares at you.

[Speaker 2]
What do I have to roll to become unparalysed?

[Speaker 1]
You can roll a DC 15 fort save.

[Speaker 8]
Alright. Why?

[Speaker 1]
So you're paralysed...

[Speaker 2]
How many times am I allowed to do that?

[Speaker 1]
Once at the end of your turn, you are able to make recall knowledge or mental calculations, but you can't do anything really physical.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think that's it then.

[Speaker 3]
I think they're both within the second range increment. Yes, okay. So that will have minus...

I'm gonna toss a dagger at one of them. I am hidden, because I rolled initiative with stealth, and they... No, they beat me.

I need to look at the flowchart. Undetected to... I beat them.

I am undetected. I'm not unnoticed. That's fine.

I get up there off guard to my attack. This is gonna suck. I love playing level 1 characters.

I need to go back to encounter. And... This should just have the range penalty in.

It does. Man, that sucks. So I'm no longer hidden.

Get rid of that. My second action, I'll draw another dagger.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
And I will stride... That is my turn. I'm just gonna put little crosses on the map where my attack is.

[Speaker 1]
All right, my turn is done.

[Speaker 5]
James? Oh, sorry. I just needed...

All right. That one is near death. All right, so...

Do these guys count for my investigation?

[Speaker 1]
For the investigation? Yeah, I'll say, yeah. All right.

Excellent.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to... As a free action, I'm gonna declare... Yeah, I'm gonna declare versus the guy right in front of Dr. Basu. Perfect. All right, I think that's gonna be effective. Then I am going to...

With my first attack... First actual attack, I'm gonna strike with the air repeater. On the guy to the left of him.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Oh wait, you know what I should do? I should move further... First.

[Speaker 1]
If you need to get into range?

[Speaker 5]
I don't want to take that range penalty. That's my bad. Roll.

Miss. That sucks. Oh no.

I'm gonna do my second attack without the air repeater. Or sorry, with... Do my second attack with the attack stratagem.

Against the other guy. Yep. I think it's just...

[Speaker 1]
Is that the minus five, Matt?

[Speaker 5]
It's the... It's just my bonus plus... When I do it with the divisive stratagem, I think it's just my bonus plus.

[Speaker 1]
You'd still take the map penalty though, I believe. Because you already made an attack.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. All right, would a... Would a 15 hit?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
No, 15 misses.

[Speaker 5]
I'm trying to remember...

[Speaker 1]
I'm wrong, that was Landy, right? That still applies the map penalty?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think it does, because divisive stratagem you don't roll, and the actual stratagem action doesn't have the attack trait. But I'm checking this out.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so it's a substitution.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I know it's a fortune roll that you pick the 13 instead of rolling. And you'll still apply your modifiers. But I think you still apply the minus five modifier.

[Speaker 5]
So the whole point of it is that you...

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, I'll take that damage.

[Speaker 5]
If you want to roll damage. To my knowledge. I'm going to designate him as off-guard to Karras.

So your next attack against that guy has...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
They get a minus two to their AC. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
And you can do your precision damage thingy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that'll be your three attacks. You note the... You notice the other skeletons start to reform.

So this one's going to start spending an action to turn back into its normal form. And it is going to attack the closest target. The closest alive target.

Which is the kitty cat. Oh, sorry, the bird. Oh.

[Speaker 7]
Ah!

[Speaker 2]
Why must you be cruel to my creature? Why? It is hanging on by a thread.

[Speaker 8]
We will cut that thread. Can you not?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I thought you were talking about a goblin. No! How do you pronounce their name?

[Speaker 2]
Soak... Soaka. Sooka?

I can only barely pronounce it myself. I am going to have to look up the pronunciation properly.

[Speaker 1]
So that one's going to stand up, that one's going to move, that one's going to come over here, and it's going to attack from behind.

[Speaker 4]
Evil. Very evil.

[Speaker 1]
That has a hit.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, first of all, how dare you. It's going to take a week to have to summon this thing again.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, for Cerys.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Okay, well, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Come from behind. And this last one. I'm not paranoid about it.

Oh, it's just drawn from all three of mine. And... Ah, I feel really bad.

It's going to attack the closest thing.

[Speaker 4]
Aww. R.I.P. Hey, it missed! Oh, it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Damn, yay! That's so lucky. Oh, thank goodness.

Look, it lives!

[Speaker 1]
And it is not happy it's been attacked by Siron, so Skul is going to attack Siron. It's going to try to bite him.

[Speaker 4]
Oh god, okay.

[Speaker 1]
That has a hit. And can I please get a TC?

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, that was Dr. Basia. Ah. Target Dr. Basia.

[Speaker 9]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want- I stand corrected, it's pronounced Sufka. Sorry. Oh, that's cute.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want me to move Cerys just a little bit?

[Speaker 2]
Just ways.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Oh, I can't because I'm not in turn. You might have to move him, like, right here.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
It means owl in Polish.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's cute.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
How do we say owl in English and German? I don't know why Duolingo thought it was important. Oh, because their mascot's an owl.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, do you want me to roll that again?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, because that was for Dr. Basia.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Actually, hold on. It was a... What was that, a 15?

[Speaker 1]
Rolled a 19, sorry. 19.

[Speaker 4]
Rolled a 19. AC is 20.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, so that's a miss. Okay. And then it's going to do another snap.

Penalty. And then... It's got nothing against Dr. Basia, so it's going to do a third. So it's miss, miss, miss.

[Speaker 4]
Can you move Ceryn back so it doesn't... Actually, it's in comps control. We're fine.

Okay, this asshole hit me. So... I have a coat pistol, which is a small pistol.

Can I have a knife out at the same time?

[Speaker 1]
Like, in the same hand?

[Speaker 4]
No, no, no. In the other hand. I'm wondering if a coat pistol is a two-hand or a one-hand.

[Speaker 1]
I'm pretty sure most pistols are one-handed. It should have listed on the weapon.

[Speaker 4]
It... doesn't.

[Speaker 2]
Assume one-handed unless it specifies two-handed.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't think I've ever... anything... I will draw my knife and attack this closest guy.

[Speaker 3]
You need to be in a squad to attack it.

[Speaker 4]
I do, I do. Okay, so that'll be three actions once I attack.

[Speaker 3]
Unless you shoot.

[Speaker 4]
I do it, I'm moved. Wait, can I shoot from this?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, shooting is ranged attack.

[Speaker 4]
We're going to scratch all of that. We're going to ignore that. I did not pull my knife out.

We're going to... We're just going to... We're just going to sheath that and shoot.

Oh, actually, pretend that I reloaded first. Reloaded, shot, and then I will use my last action to reload again. So that I don't have to do it next time.

So that's three. And I will end my turn.

[Speaker 5]
Remember, you have free precision... If you have another attack, you have free precision damage against the guy right next to you.

[Speaker 1]
It has... You notice it doesn't really do anything at all.

[Speaker 4]
It's not magical.

[Speaker 1]
You notice that normally piercing weapons aren't too effective against bones.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, cool. What happened to Siryn?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Wasn't it the goblin's turn?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I thought I just had the goblin. I must have forgotten. Yeah, so it's going to attack Doctor.

[Speaker 2]
Ow.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to do a scratch. Great damage. It's going to do another attack.

Missing.

[Speaker 2]
How did it miss? I'm on the ground. Hey, that's a hit.

Bad luck.

[Speaker 1]
For an extra four. As it starts to go in a frenzy on you.

[Speaker 2]
I would rather it did not do that.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Oh, that was quick. Okay.

Boop. Boop. Okay, so that's a critical hit and a hit.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Nice. And I only roll for one?

[Speaker 1]
So you roll both damage, but we treat the damage as combined for the purpose of mitigating.

[Speaker 4]
He's dead. Yep. And then I will spend my last action...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, which one are you targeting?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm sorry, this one. Oh, skeleton. Was it the skeleton that I was attacking?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I was just confused about you attacking the skeleton.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my bad. You know what? What did I roll for?

[Speaker 3]
You also don't have anything to trigger sneak attack.

[Speaker 5]
The guy on the right, she has sneak attack against because it's...

[Speaker 4]
I was right here.

[Speaker 9]
But is paralyzed, so it doesn't gain barrenness, so it's full flanking.

[Speaker 5]
Pixies can't flank. No, it's not about... The thing on the right wasn't about...

I don't know which one she's targeting. If she targets the one on the right, she gets the precision damage because it's off guard from my share strateger.

[Speaker 4]
I targeted the one that I was in the block with. Can you use the... Does a 29 and a 17 hit this one?

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we'll just treat it as... That's what I hit.

[Speaker 3]
Wouldn't deal that much damage, though.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but can you... Need to roll it without the... I can just take away the 8.

So it'd be... 14 plus 8. It's basically dead anyway.

[Speaker 4]
And then I will spend my last action. Actually, is the double hit a 1 action or a 2? I think that's a 2 action.

[Speaker 7]
2 action, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll move here. Hello. Oh, you look awesome.

Alright, that's my turn. Hold on. I'll be AFK for a minute.

[Speaker 1]
No problems. Dr. Bakia.

[Speaker 2]
Dr. Bakia is still currently minorly paralyzed, but the familiar can do one thing, and that is fly, since that's the most it can do by itself. So it is... First, this thing's going...

Taking its full flight. I'm flying a bit into the air at a diagonal, so it's here. Ah!

It says it's still Siryn's turn.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Siryn's?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it's still Siryn's turn, so I can't move... Ah, there we go. Mercy...

So, fly speed of 25 feet. So at the diagonal upwards, it is going to fly here. And let me just...

There we go. And then I'll roll my Fortitude saving throw. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
To be a DC-14.

[Speaker 2]
I'm still paralyzed.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, Sierra's turn.

[Speaker 2]
Ugh, what bad luck. I have to roll a 6 or higher.

[Speaker 3]
Um... You can't flank if you're... Paralyzed, so...

I'll take an action to stride. I will try and feint this goblin. I think I can just ping it like this and then roll.

Failure. Cool! I'm going to hit it with my Chloratack.

[Speaker 8]
Ah, mood.

[Speaker 2]
Hello, I'm back. Hello! I failed my Fortitude save.

I have to roll higher than a 6, and yet... Oh no.

[Speaker 3]
Ugh, my Chloratack sucks. I need my Chlordancer archetype. I need level 2 chains!

[Speaker 6]
There, there.

[Speaker 3]
That's a turn done. Yep. My cannon.

[Speaker 5]
Well... Is the, uh... I can't remember if...

Skellingtons have an issue when it comes to...

[Speaker 1]
You can do a Recall Knowledge check if you'd like.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to do a Recall Knowledge for Skellingtons. I want to figure out a weakness against them.

[Speaker 6]
Um... Let me see.

[Speaker 1]
So, you want to know their weakness?

[Speaker 5]
Like, if they're a weakness or a strength, or whether or not precision damage affects them.

[Speaker 1]
They have no weakness.

[Speaker 5]
Devise a strategy versus the goblin. That is perfect. I'm going to roll...

Yeah. Rolling an attack versus me. I don't know why I keep saying, I'm going to...

That's not... Not helpful.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, that is it.

[Speaker 3]
Also, sorry, I think that you were right with multi-attack penalty and devise a strategy. I wasn't...

[Speaker 5]
I'll roll it with the multi-attack penalty then.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, no, that's only if you do a first attack. So it's basically just to stop you from saving when you feel like you lost your third roll, just to get your maximum bonus. So, it's a fortunate one that it changes to zero roll, but you still apply any penalties and modifiers.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, no, no, I didn't roll... I didn't roll devise a strategy versus the skeleton I'm doing versus the other guy. Okay.

Why did that not apply... Intelligence? I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the only thing I found is that the stratagem has to be the first attack you make against the creature that round.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect. I win. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Skeleton, I win. He's going to run...

Whoops, that was a wonky line. He's going to spend one action to run here. And he's going to do an attack.

Critical miss!

[Speaker 7]
Oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
And a hit. As he runs up and he starts to claw into my cannon.

[Speaker 7]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
One.

[Speaker 6]
One. Who's closest?

[Speaker 1]
30, 30. I'm going to roll a 1d2. One.

I'm going to go up here. He's going to do an attack.

[Speaker 8]
Heart, what is this gift here? Which one? The one laying in the rain.

That's me. Oh no, are you paralyzed? Yes!

That's why I haven't been doing anything. Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
This one's going to do three attacks.

[Speaker 2]
That's the fortitude saves I keep failing. It's literally a 14 out of 20, I shall make it. And yet, I am rolling below a 6.

[Speaker 1]
So Cirrus, you take the 7 damage.

[Speaker 4]
How much damage? 4?

[Speaker 1]
7.

[Speaker 4]
7, okay. And then 4? Oh no, that was missed, sorry.

Took the damage.

[Speaker 1]
That one. Now Cirrus is done.

[Speaker 4]
It's not doing so well. Get her running speed. 20 feet, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, did I take damage? Sorry, let me do that.

[Speaker 1]
I think you took 5 damage.

[Speaker 4]
There we go. I will... Oh, you know what I didn't do?

That. Oh god, I can't do placements. Um...

Oh god help me. God help me. Um...

Let's try that again. Alright, let's try that again. Oh god, I...

I'm trying my best here, folks. It's alright, it's alright. Okay.

Why is it only doing the placements? I'm trying to do, uh, this.

[Speaker 2]
If you put it on yourself it'll auto-apply to us. How do I do that, first of all? It's on.

It's being turned on.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Now everything's gone orange.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome. And that is a... That's a 1.

Okay, so I can do an attack as well. I can do one more attack. Do you need to reload?

No, I do not need to reload. I reloaded last time. Boop.

Miss. Alright. It's my turn.

Actually, no. I didn't shoot. I didn't shoot because I moved and then did a spell?

No.

[Speaker 6]
Shoot's only one action.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, that was one thing. We're good.

[Speaker 6]
Still fine.

[Speaker 4]
Nevermind, it did shoot. I just missed.

[Speaker 6]
Alrighty. He's gonna attack. Clockwise.

[Speaker 4]
You'll get the hang of this eventually.

[Speaker 6]
Three.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and... I believe I need to attack you...

[Speaker 2]
Can you please stop hitting me? Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not gonna attack you this time. So how do I do... God.

Sorry for that attack. Okay, so the one that's going to attack you, it is not happy that you've... kind of attacked it.

And it's going to make an attack on you.

[Speaker 3]
Use my reaction to nimble dodge. Helps my AC by two a bit.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think that matters. Why am I... oh god.

Because you've rolled a critical fail.

[Speaker 3]
Huh?

[Speaker 1]
Your critical fail for your last check.

[Speaker 3]
Oh.

[Speaker 1]
For your feint.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Yes. Thank you.

Yeah, that doesn't do anything. My reaction's gone. Still hits.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So then... Damage!

And then Kappa's got 8 DC, 15 floor save.

[Speaker 3]
Hello, Dr. Batra. I am in the club with you.

[Speaker 8]
Hi!

[Speaker 3]
How's it going?

[Speaker 1]
It's just snapping at it, everyone. Critical miss. Snap, snap, snap, snap.

Miss, miss, miss, miss. Siren's dead.

[Speaker 2]
I have the perfect gift for this, one sec. There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, Siren. Oh, let me...

[Speaker 7]
Alright. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
You're not flanking, so you don't get the...

[Speaker 4]
How do I turn that off?

[Speaker 1]
Precise.

[Speaker 6]
But...

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I see it. Enable abilities that require an off-guard target. My bad.

[Speaker 1]
3D4 plus 10.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just re-roll that.

[Speaker 1]
Nah, that's a kill anyway.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'll get the hang of this eventually. Um...

Alright. And then we have this guy. So I'm just gonna go ahead and move to him, and that will be my last turn.

Yeah, my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And Dr. Bacchus. Oh, sorry, Bacchio.

[Speaker 2]
I like how you pronounce their name differently every single time. That is incredible, honestly.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not gonna lie, the... The formatting of it's really weird, and the health bar HP's overlapping the names. So I see Doctor, and I see nothing else besides B-A-3-3-A.

[Speaker 2]
Huh. Well, it's Bacchia, if that helps. Bacchia, sorry.

Please, for the love of god, no!

[Speaker 4]
Every time!

[Speaker 1]
Wait, wait, wait! Oh, no, no, you failed by one.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, has it been an hour? Can they have a hero point?

[Speaker 1]
You do have a hero point.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Does Courageous Anthem apply to it?

[Speaker 1]
It's fine, it's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Courageous Anthem can apply to it as well. It saves against fear effects. I thought it was just plus one save for everything.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, even if we remove the Courageous Anthem, I still pass it.

[Speaker 3]
I was only asking because I opted to not use it because it's not a fear effect.

[Speaker 2]
Ah. Okay, okay. That makes sense.

Well, I'm off the ground now. You can only do it at the end of your turn, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. So you can still make a familiar...

[Speaker 2]
Ah, darn.

[Speaker 1]
I can command a familiar to do mental action. So I'd give you, if you'd want to spend an action, give it a two. It'd be fine.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. I will tuck them underneath my arm or something, so at least they're on me and I can use them later.

[Speaker 1]
You don't want to keep in the sky?

[Speaker 2]
I actually need that to heal, but I can just keep them in the sky. But I... no.

You know what? No, I need to put them on my shoulder or something because I need them to heal. So hopefully they don't die while they're on me.

[Speaker 3]
Spiral Eye is an incap effect.

[Speaker 6]
I...

[Speaker 2]
Well, I mean, you are incapacitated.

[Speaker 3]
I believe it's a paralysed effect. It doesn't have the incapacitation trait? I don't see it.

[Speaker 1]
So...

[Speaker 6]
Finesse, Unarmed, Fortitude...

[Speaker 1]
Ah, I'd have to quickly double check for that one. It says you can still... Ascend to still function, you can only...

Areas you can perceive without moving, so you can't seek. It doesn't have anything in the paralysed section for it.

[Speaker 3]
Can you ping the ability? If it has the incap trait, then it would actually be not as bad. So Dr. Vash...

What level are the goblins, actually? Dr. Vash is level 2, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
It's just the paralysed condition.

[Speaker 2]
I still ate dirt, though.

[Speaker 3]
I'll make a fort save, then.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so you get it in one.

[Speaker 3]
It's that easy.

[Speaker 2]
In my defence, I am a feeble wizard. Leave me be.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I'm off guard anymore, now.

[Speaker 1]
That'd be incapacitation, occult decrement.

[Speaker 3]
So it is incap.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I see. What was Dr. Vash's initial save?

[Speaker 2]
It was...

[Speaker 3]
Was it a fail, just a failure, or a crit fail?

[Speaker 2]
It was a regular failure. I failed every single time.

[Speaker 3]
Well, it would have been a success, then.

[Speaker 2]
What?

[Speaker 3]
The incap effects that are below your level, and if this is, like, a creature ability, it uses his level, you trade the save as 1 degree of success better.

[Speaker 2]
You have got to be kidding me. I could have been up several rounds ago!

[Speaker 3]
You would have been up the first round. It wouldn't have affected you beyond the first.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, my god. Well, hey, you live, you learn. I am.

You can't see it, but my head is in my hands.

[Speaker 3]
So, is it still Zero's turn, or...? No, the incap for me is fine, because I'm level 1. And so are they. It's just Dr. Vasha that wouldn't have affected.

[Speaker 2]
I... well... Live, learn.

[Speaker 5]
Does this mean it's my turn?

[Speaker 1]
I'm just trying to find out, because it hasn't got listed on the stat block. But when I looked up one of the other ones, it does.

[Speaker 3]
It's probably an adventure path creature, terribly written. Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
I am going to... well... No, it's not that I'm going to thing.

[Speaker 3]
Look, at least you didn't hit us with a Cloudskill at level 3. I still think you should have stocked your guns with that one, James. That would have been so funny.

Because I didn't want you guys to have it. That's the reason why. Well, we wouldn't have been able to use it, because you need to be able to cast spells of that level to use the wand.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you do? Yeah, man, don't argue.

[Speaker 3]
DM monsters get DM bullshit, so they don't have to abide by the rules. But we do.

[Speaker 4]
He probably also has, you know, some empathy.

[Speaker 3]
I have no empathy.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my character's gonna die.

[Speaker 3]
James should have no empathy for me by this point.

[Speaker 5]
There's none. There's none. Don't worry.

[Speaker 4]
There's no empathy?

[Speaker 8]
None? No.

[Speaker 1]
What is it, bludgeoning?

[Speaker 8]
I believe it.

[Speaker 5]
There you go.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I was just saying, it seems to take the full effect of the blow.

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah. I'd do it again. I missed.

I'm gonna designate it as off-guard. I don't know if Undyne can be off-guard, but I will designate it as off-guard to Karas.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. It would be better if you designated things off-guard to Siren.

[Speaker 5]
I will designate it as off-guard to Siren.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you. Which one?

[Speaker 5]
The one right in front of me. Goblin Skellington.

[Speaker 4]
I can move and then, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And, is that your third action? That's my third action.

[Speaker 4]
He can probably move up to me. Just hit Siren. Yeah, Siren's gonna hit Karas.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so... Closer person. It's gonna move over here.

It's gonna do some stabby-stabby with its claws. Out of swats viciously.

[Speaker 4]
Ouch. Karas is doing so well, guys. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have soothe on you?

[Speaker 6]
This one is gonna attack Siren. And...

[Speaker 1]
It's gonna distribute three attacks.

[Speaker 3]
Critting. Crit all three, come on. Crit all three.

[Speaker 4]
Why are you preying on my downfall?

[Speaker 1]
Hey, it is a crit, but it's a crit miss. Two crit misses!

[Speaker 4]
Crit all three, that's beautiful, I love it.

[Speaker 1]
And then this one here is going to attack Siren from behind.

[Speaker 4]
Hold on, did you... Okay, you did.

[Speaker 3]
Blanking Skeletons.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, really, they're just charging towards the closest.

[Speaker 6]
Miss-miss.

[Speaker 1]
It's their sister.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, um... She's going to... Go all the way...

Over here with two actions. Or actually, you know what, we'll go over here. Yeah, we'll go here with two actions.

And her other action will be... Shooting. No, we did shoot, we'll have to reload.

Okay. Her other action will be reloading. That will be her turn.

[Speaker 1]
And Siren's turn.

[Speaker 4]
Oh shit, okay. Alright, so this guy is off-guard to Siren. Uh-oh, I fucked up.

I fucked up. I can't click him. Can you move Siren over one?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, should be good.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you moved him up, thank you. Perfecto. Alright, so he's off-guard.

[Speaker 1]
That is a hit.

[Speaker 4]
Doop. Doop.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, why is he off-guard?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, because McCannon helped.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yep, yep, yep.

[Speaker 4]
And then I swiftly turned it off, so it'll fuck up next.

[Speaker 3]
Yep. It'd just be the first strike there that would have precision.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, thank you. I was gonna ask, um... But then I didn't.

[Speaker 1]
You notice that slashing weapons aren't really too effective against it.

[Speaker 4]
Goddamnit. So it doesn't take any damage from that?

[Speaker 1]
It takes very little. Minuscule. As you start to chip away at its bones.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Great. Have fun, guys.

That's all I got. Uh, and then I will end my turn, I think?

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait, did you double-strike?

[Speaker 4]
I did.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you do more damage than anticipated.

[Speaker 6]
Um, ten. So I'm taking three.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'm gonna go grab the groceries. Okie dokie.

[Speaker 2]
So... Now that it is my turn, this is what I needed to use the bird for. Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

This is a terrible game for me. Hmm? Oh, two.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, nevermind, yeah, it's just one. Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 2]
I am having a fantastic day. Anyway, that's what I get for not reading up on paralysis rules. Da-da-da-da!

With my official turn, we will force barrage. Because it... This is getting a problem.

Rest. No damage. Oh, neat.

I'll use... two actions for that. So it will be eight damage.

Or do I roll again?

[Speaker 1]
Um... Is it 1d4 plus one bolt for a number of bolts? So I think it's just one damage.

And just times it by number of actions you use.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so two. So that will be eight damage. And then, I will use...

my other action... to move away! Goodbye!

Hold on, how far can I walk from this thing? Um... That's far enough.

I still want people to cast spells. Just, like, here.

[Speaker 7]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, that is my turn.

[Speaker 6]
Perfect. And then, Sierra's turn.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, can I do a recall knowledge against the skeleton? To see if they're mindless? Um...

Where is it? I don't know if that worked properly.

[Speaker 1]
You notice the skeletons are mindless, but the others appear to be mindful. Okay, um... Looks like these ones here, they seem sentient and knowledgeable.

[Speaker 7]
But the skeletons not so much.

[Speaker 3]
So basically, the skeletons are immune to mental effects. Yeah? Okay, I'll stride to here, and I'll take the hide action behind this tree.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, they haven't got the trait... mindless.

[Speaker 3]
So they're not immune to mental, is what you're telling me. Hmm. In that case, then.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, but they might flounder the... uh... It's got the undead and unholy.

[Speaker 3]
Skeletons are capable of using weapons and stuff, so typically they're not mindless. Zombies, on the other hand, are mindless. Okay, um...

I'll try and feint this guy, then. Woo! And I'll stab him with my throwing knife.

Because I can't... trigger sneak attack with my claws.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, which one have you got targeted? This one? That one.

[Speaker 3]
Perfect. And that's all three of my actions.

[Speaker 1]
You do notice, though, that, uh... piercing damage is not too very effective against it.

[Speaker 3]
Do they resist the, um... precision damage?

[Speaker 1]
It says they take precision damage. Okay. The cannon.

[Speaker 5]
And again, that was Shredgun18. Definitely gonna shoot that motherfucker. Aw.

I was hoping for a crit. No such luck.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have, like, a ring camera on that? So you can get the guy into the... Oh.

[Speaker 4]
I think the person that delivered it just took a picture of our approach and left without delivering it.

[Speaker 1]
Do you report that, then? Which one are you attacking, sir?

[Speaker 5]
The O'Goblin Skellington to the bottom right. That one? Immune to mental.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
You see it takes, uh... basically nothing from it. Like, just a little chip just bounces right off him.

[Speaker 5]
That is unfortunate.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, they are immune to mental?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. They are immune to mental.

[Speaker 3]
It's weird that it let the... Yeah. It's weird that it let the feint go through, then, because it is also mental.

[Speaker 5]
That is weird.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So, they aren't mindless, but they are immune to mental.

[Speaker 3]
Huh. They shouldn't have taken my precision damage, then. They weren't off guard.

[Speaker 2]
Oh well. Live, learn.

[Speaker 3]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So, I know the minions that I summon are mindless. So, I'm like, oh, okay. This one...

There's one target close, it's going to go frenzy and it's going to do a... just go to ham, start to swing recklessly and wildly... to devour the living flesh.

Or missing.

[Speaker 6]
That one, it's going to attack Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
Hit. And it swings with its claws. And it's going to keep attacking.

[Speaker 3]
She would have nimble-dodged the last one, but that, again, doesn't change anything.

[Speaker 1]
Well, it's going to go here, it's going to attack the closest one. And it's going to do two attacks.

[Speaker 3]
By raw, I am not sure if they are flanking, Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
I think they are. They can draw a line through the middle. Yes, I think they are.

So, in the rules of flanking, it says tiny creatures can potentially count as flanking for the purpose of DM's discretion. So, I'm not sure if you want to do an implement rule as if tiny creatures can flank. It does make sense to me.

[Speaker 5]
They usually do it when two creatures are already flanking. If two creatures are already flanking, and Charis or Saren, whichever one, occupies that same space, that's usually when it makes a lot of sense. Or feels like it makes a lot of sense.

Yeah, Charis' turn.

[Speaker 7]
Charis?

[Speaker 2]
I think she went off temporarily, she needed to get something.

[Speaker 1]
Doctor, do you want to have a go and just delay her?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no problem. What is the most injured one? Is the goblin skeleton that is below Sairon the most injured one so far?

I can't see.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yes it is. This one is the most injured. And then I think it's this one and this one.

[Speaker 2]
Cool, awesome. We are casting electric arc on that most injured one and I guess the second most injured one. Cool, let's roll damage.

[Speaker 1]
You notice electricity has no effect on it. Oh, cool.

[Speaker 2]
I suppose that makes sense. It is a thing. I'll cast that real quick then.

And I will attack. It is a mist. C'est la vie.

That is the end of my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Did I accidentally drag Doctor Bacchus? Oops. Oops, sorry.

Just quickly fixing it. Perfect. There you go.

Sorry. Sierra's turn.

[Speaker 3]
If these guys are immune to mental then I am going to go with my original plan of moving to the tree, hiding, and then trying to sneak.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, get a stealth please.

[Speaker 4]
21.

[Speaker 6]
You are stealthed.

[Speaker 3]
Which would then give me... I should be hidden from the skeleton so I can throw a knife that it is off guard to. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
It's a hit. Which one?

[Speaker 3]
The one I helped target with the guy.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, roll damage.

[Speaker 3]
I just need to see if my dex applies to this. This is the thief racket. When you attack with a...

Oh, it's for melee. Sad. Add my strength modifier of plus zero to damage.

I am no longer hidden.

[Speaker 1]
You throw it and it starts to chip away at some bones. My cannon's turn.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not really sure what to do at this point.

[Speaker 7]
He's going to kill them!

[Speaker 5]
I know. Move it up. Stratagem...

Hey, that's good, that's good. Sad. There we go.

I designate off guard to Siren.

[Speaker 7]
Um, I will...

[Speaker 5]
Gonna grapple... Yeah, he's grappled. Nope, I failed.

Alright, that's the end of my turn.

[Speaker 7]
Siren.

[Speaker 4]
Um, okay, I will move up. Target this guy. Yep.

And strike one. And then turn that off and strike again.

[Speaker 6]
And roll damage.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, good job.

[Speaker 4]
They don't do too much, but you know...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, are you using your strength for damage? For your modifier? Or do you have the bonus for the dex?

[Speaker 4]
I'm just doing what the thing told me to do, I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Are you a thief, Rogue?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
They can add dex to melee attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that's seventeen... So that kills it.

[Speaker 6]
How do you kill it? Oh.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know, he does a little spin or something. Bones go flying.

[Speaker 1]
Start to chip out the important spinal cords. Yeah. And then Cerys's turn.

[Speaker 4]
Um, who's alive?

[Speaker 7]
Just this one down here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, this one's down here? Alright. Um...

[Speaker 7]
Oops. That's a hit.

[Speaker 4]
Awesome. And then...

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't seem to affect a roll.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I see. Um... Well then, did I...

Did I, um... Reload my gun last time?

[Speaker 1]
I think you did an attack and then you shot.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, alright, I'll reload my gun then. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
That one, closest person's cannon, it's going to run up and... Do an attack. Hitting as it digs its bony claws into your side.

Tries to flop, but misses.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, splendid. Kicking a rock at it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, we're... Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Hey!

[Speaker 2]
I think I was annoyed enough of being paralysed for three rounds. Alright, and that... Oh, that's two, I still have one more attack.

What can I do? I... I will throw something at it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, a rock's usually got a massive crack in its skull. It's barely, uh, together.

[Speaker 2]
Hm. Well. Let's see.

Uh... I did not think this far, I should have thought about it more. Lightning doesn't work, fire?

Would fire work against this?

[Speaker 1]
You can do a recoil noise check.

[Speaker 2]
No, that will waste my one turn. I might as well throw a versatile violet at it. Whatever.

[Speaker 5]
If it dies, you were right.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, exactly! Science, you know? Hm, it misses.

[Speaker 1]
Take the splash.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Damage... Splash is one.

Do I roll it anywhere?

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then I think, uh, mechanic also takes an active... Nope, I rolled it twice.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, on a failure, the damage is just to the target.

[Speaker 7]
Okay. There we go. Yeah, it's dead.

[Speaker 3]
It is in the splash trait. Uh, I'll draw my third throwing dagger. Stride, and then take a swing at it.

That's my turn. Never catch me using a hero point. Whenever you need it.

[Speaker 1]
The cannon.

[Speaker 5]
Beat his ass.

[Speaker 3]
Nice. Works for me.

[Speaker 2]
Investigators are very cool.

[Speaker 5]
That's a hit. There we go. Dead.

[Speaker 2]
Joyous day. It is dead. Woo!

Do you think it would come back to life if I collect its bones again? I probably shouldn't do that. Alright, how's your bird?

[Speaker 3]
Bird is fine.

[Speaker 2]
It's at 1 HP. I'll, uh, feed it a health potion.

[Speaker 1]
It was very... There is an eerie silence. Feels the veil.

[Speaker 5]
I just like the shooter challenge.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna... Okay, we don't have... Does anyone have...

Healing? Yes, yes. We have a lot of injured.

We have Dr. Basia, who's injured. Uh, Charis.

[Speaker 3]
Sierra, back on this, for you to follow inside so we can rest in the safety of this building.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, alright, we can...

[Speaker 3]
Am I able to try and open this chest? Yeah. I have thieves tools.

Yeah. Um... I think it's an action.

Unlock.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to stay just outside the door in case it blows up.

[Speaker 1]
You know, as you try to, uh, open it up, it's locked open. Huh? Oh.

It's locked open.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, good. It wasn't a terrible trap. Find anything interesting?

[Speaker 3]
She just sort of shrugs and leaves it all. Um, and is going to start treating her own wounds.

[Speaker 8]
Oil of Unlife?

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna look in the chest. It's locked?

[Speaker 2]
Fascinating. Uh, no longer.

[Speaker 1]
It's locked open.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know what that means, but it's open.

[Speaker 1]
You can't shut it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Oh, interesting.

[Speaker 5]
Folks, I'm going to get ready to leave early here. I'm not jumping out just yet, but I'm going to get ready to go to work.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Have a good luck.

[Speaker 5]
I was getting ready.

[Speaker 2]
Bah. Oil of Unlife is such a fascinating...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm taking these marbles.

[Speaker 3]
Incredible.

[Speaker 2]
What's up with the marbles? Ooh, fun. You can pour them.

Enjoy your marbles. That's real nice. What's the kite?

Oh, this is just a kite. That's awesome. That's cute.

[Speaker 1]
I might take the... Yeah, you notice inside the room it's kind of like all trashed together. Nothing's really too valuable except what's probably inside the chest.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, Oil of Unlife. Yes, very fascinating, isn't it? You might want it for Susudio, eh?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, can I have one of my characters give that to Susudio? Is that a thing I can do?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, they know Susudio, so yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I know at least Charis knows Susudio.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. Susudio will be studied like a bug later. I hope you're aware of that.

He's completely okay with that. Fantastic. That's good news.

[Speaker 3]
The Nathrogathas characters don't get any of the silver and copper, right?

[Speaker 2]
I'm fine with that. Okay, I will do math.

[Speaker 3]
I think the Oil of Unlife's pretty cheap, isn't it? 12 gold. That's worth, like, the rest of the loot combined.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I know. You guys go at it. Siren has, like, way too much gold.

I don't know how he got it. I don't remember.

[Speaker 2]
I'll put it in the party sheet just so it's easier for me to do the math. Oh, wait, no, it tells the total coinage here. Would you look at that?

Total wealth. And there are how many of us in this lovely party left? There would be three people to split it between.

16.8 divided by 3 is probably a number.

[Speaker 1]
5.6. I can distribute the coinage towards everyone. That would give them people we don't want them to.

[Speaker 2]
That would be 5.6 gold for everyone else.

[Speaker 3]
I can just add that to my sheet. Well, I guess it would be 56 silver. Right?

[Speaker 2]
Well, yeah, sure, 56 silver. But you can also do 5.6 gold, assuming we have somehow, someway transferred it. Thank you for running the game, it was very fun.

Indeed, indeed.

[Speaker 3]
While we finished.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, oh no, I thought, well. It was just one fight. That is true.

Well, I guess I shall chug some of my healing.

[Speaker 1]
Now, if you guys want to keep going, we'll be more than welcome to continue on for a session. Otherwise, if you're caught here, we can start tidying it up. Depends if people have to go or not.

I'm not too sure how late it is for some, but James said he had to go to work.

[Speaker 2]
That is true. He's currently away from keyboard, which means he's probably listening in but can't talk, so.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I mean, I'm good with going on, but. It's getting changed in streams, I mean.

[Speaker 3]
Are we going on? Look, I'm happy to do whatever. I treat wounds as a plus four if anyone else would like to try and do it.

[Speaker 2]
Feel free to attempt.

[Speaker 3]
You're welcome. Ow! Put me in for an hour.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks, man. Will you attempt the bird? Perhaps that will fare better.

[Speaker 3]
We spend another ten minutes waiting for me to treat wounds. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you start to bandage your wounds. Is anyone else doing anything else? I think there's a...

[Speaker 4]
My heart here desperately needs healing. Does anyone have a potion?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I have several. Do you want an elixir of life or a healing potion? Which one will heal me the most?

A healing potion. Let me give you a couple.

[Speaker 1]
I think we might be sick. Were you just waiting to continue on, or I was like, I don't want to waste your potions.

[Speaker 3]
I'm happy to continue. If we can manage to heal.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you'd also be able to turn back to town as well, too. So there'd be some more stuff in town. So you can probably go to a healer in town if you want to try and save some of your coin.

[Speaker 2]
That's alright. Okay, so I'm healed best I can without wasting any potions.

[Speaker 3]
If we wait an hour, we can just try again. How long did it take us to walk here from town? That was a couple hours.

Alright, let's just wait here. Give me one more chance. Let me try and heal Cerys and Siren.

And then by the time I've done them... You'd probably get hurt by nighttime. Yeah, then I can try myself again.

And if I keep failing, then... So this one's to Cerys. See?

Easy. Healed. This one's to Siren.

Another ten minutes. It's fucking over. Let's go back to town.

[Speaker 2]
You can give one to... Isn't it an hour?

[Speaker 3]
It's an hour, so I would have to go, like, Siren... It's part of that...

[Speaker 1]
Ten minutes is part of that hour. So it's like, if you do the ten minutes, you wait fifteen minutes.

[Speaker 2]
You can also try healing Mechanica.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, this one's to Mechanon.

[Speaker 2]
Mechanon.

[Speaker 3]
No, come back to town, fuck this.

[Speaker 2]
We're having an excellent time.

[Speaker 3]
Sierra's pissed off at this point. It's getting increasingly worse.

[Speaker 2]
There, there. Patsy on the back. So, what would be next off on the agenda if we are continuing from here?

Dragging these people back? We have several bones we could do that with.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you want to take some bones back? So the contingency for the reward was proof of, um... Was proof.

[Speaker 4]
So we take the goblins. The stinking goblins.

[Speaker 1]
James laughing. He's like, there is no proof. James is mean.

[Speaker 3]
Why isn't Siren doing these checks? Siren, do treat medicine for the next hour. Sorry, treat wounds.

[Speaker 4]
Do I have the ability to?

[Speaker 3]
You have a plus six. Yes, you do.

[Speaker 4]
I have a plus six? Where did he get this knowledge from?

[Speaker 3]
Brokes get a lot of skills.

[Speaker 4]
Um, yeah. I just imagine... I just imagine Siren just shoving.

[Speaker 3]
Are you targeting first with your treat wounds?

[Speaker 4]
Um... Who needs it?

[Speaker 5]
I have drank an unholy amount of potions. I should be fine. The strange other investigator known as Matty Caines.

I would, uh... If you happen to spot any true names of any nasty creatures... That might be conjuring up these skeletons, I'd be much obliged.

[Speaker 2]
That gives a little salute.

[Speaker 3]
The aeronauts.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I'm going to hobble off now with this fucking injury.

[Speaker 8]
Goodbye!

[Speaker 7]
Don't get lost!

[Speaker 2]
Do be careful of any other goblins.

[Speaker 1]
So did you take the loot from the chest? I would be happy to.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, uh... Drag it into the party thing.

[Speaker 3]
Did McCannon get his 5.6 gold?

[Speaker 1]
I will add 5.6 gold to my character sheet. And then you also get 5 gold from the quest. Hell yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, and 5 gold from the quest. Awesome. What is the .6?

Uh, silver.

[Speaker 4]
Copper. Would that just be 6 silver? Or copper?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
You don't have to worry about this.

[Speaker 4]
I was just curious about the numbers for future reference. Because I'm terrible with math. Yeah, no problem.

[Speaker 5]
5 gold, 6 silver. Then why are you spending more time? Don't spend more time on it.

That's a bad idea.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we give him the bones. We're like, ah, we did the thing. I'll ask if I can keep the bones and see how all this reanimation is happening then.

Especially because Mechanic had asked nicely. McCannon. I'm adding too many syllables.

[Speaker 4]
McCannon and...

[Speaker 5]
One syllable for each increase. I mean...

[Speaker 1]
I believe there is a bunch of pile of bones. You want to grab them? You can check my inventory?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I will do that. I'm going to be encumbered, but it's fine. Important for research, bones are.

And create undead once I get...

[Speaker 1]
I believe anyone can also chuck them into the party stash.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, I probably should do that. That's probably a better idea.

[Speaker 3]
I am not carrying anyone's bones.

[Speaker 2]
I'll carry my own bones. But they're still going in the party stash. Just so I can keep track of them.

[Speaker 3]
If Saren's medicine check was to Sierra, that's a fail.

[Speaker 4]
Can you repeat that?

[Speaker 3]
If your medicine check before was to Sierra, that's a fail for trait wounds.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right.

[Speaker 2]
So, are we doing more banditry, or are we...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so you managed to scatter this to ground. I'll get an occult check if you're trying to determine more from the undead.

[Speaker 2]
Sure, why not. Occult, let's go. That's something I'm trained in.

I jinxed it.

[Speaker 1]
Skeletons can be raised by necromancers. They don't need to be too particularly powerful to raise some of the skeletons. There can be variations.

But ghouls are a little bit harder to raise than normal. It requires someone a bit stronger to raise them.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, were the weird goblins ghouls?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, that makes sense. I guess we should investigate that indeed.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so is there anything else you want to do in this area?

[Speaker 3]
Is that going? Hard.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I fixed it.

[Speaker 3]
I still need healing. I don't want to leave until I am healed. But now we have to wait another hour.

[Speaker 2]

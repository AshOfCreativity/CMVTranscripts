[Speaker 3]
What checks need to be done for fishing?

[Speaker 2]
Fishing is the naturalization. In the downtime I can find that for you. Thank you.

I've got downtime for you.

[Speaker 3]
Because I think Zianna is going to expend a spell slot, because then that makes the check on the table better by the spell slot, as well as your cook's check is increased by the level of the spell slot expended, so that means monk's check is better as well.

[Speaker 1]
What character is Zianna playing?

[Speaker 3]
Charlotte's playing Zianna. Well, sorry, what class is Zianna? 6 Sorc, 3 Warlock.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, that's right, that's right. So first is survival of nature, second is athletics, or acrobatics.

[Speaker 2]
Is this for the whole journey, or is it just for the end? I guess it'd be the whole journey, like four days, wouldn't it?

[Speaker 3]
No, this is for the end of it. The cloud forest.

[Speaker 2]
Because you guys aren't flying, it sounds like.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, so survival or nature, so it'd be nature.

[Speaker 2]
The last one can be athletics or survival. You get to do one of those checks.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so this is for the fishing, so the survival or nature, boom.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, these are all plus two, whoops. So that's a 17. So you only have to make that one check.

It's one check per day of travel.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Yeah, so that's a plus two, so it's a 17 for the fishing check, and then monk's check goes up by two as well.

[Speaker 2]
Sweet.

[Speaker 3]
So what does a 17 do on the fishing table, then? Or is that...

[Speaker 1]
So are they going with a... Okay, so 17. 17's a success.

[Speaker 3]
17 just succeeds, actually. And the... Oh no, it's all...

[Speaker 5]
Sir, I have to roll on the table? I can't get it.

[Speaker 2]
Could it just be like a flat skill check, like wisdom or something? Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, roll like a wisdom check. Start a fire and roast a piece of something.

[Speaker 4]
Start a fire, oh!

[Speaker 2]
Remember to add a plus two.

[Speaker 4]
Roast it with pure blue booze.

[Speaker 1]
That should give somebody a bonus. I always wanted to go through... In the encounter manual, we're constantly referencing flavors that certain monster parts add to a meal.

[Speaker 5]
That makes me want to bring Tossie in.

[Speaker 1]
We were so close to a Final Fantasy cookie deal. Yay! Nice!

[Speaker 5]
It's not too bad! He's got high wisdom.

[Speaker 1]
Have Zeana roll once on the chart, by the way.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, what dice do I have to roll for the chart? One d20.

[Speaker 4]
Are we in a forest?

[Speaker 3]
You are in a forest.

[Speaker 4]
I believe... Oh wait, no. Never mind, I didn't make it.

Never mind. I was like, I thought I made it for the first one. But no, I made all the stuff you get from it.

[Speaker 2]
We've got fish. The monk's absolutely making beer-battered fish, right?

[Speaker 4]
Did I do the fish? No, I think I only did the arctic. I thought I did the forest.

[Speaker 2]
It's okay. All of it will be arctic eventually, so you can just keep that one. James...

[Speaker 7]
Oh no, he killed him.

[Speaker 3]
With, it says, expending the warlock spell slots for fissuring, Charlotte wants to know, so we've expended one to increase the check by two. It says you can increase the check or the result on the table by the level of the spell slot. Could she expend another spell slot to increase the result on the table by two?

I don't see why not. Sick, there you go, you were right. I'll use all of my warlock cards.

Easy, so yeah, so a 15 on the table then.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 15.

[Speaker 3]
I assume higher is better on the table.

[Speaker 1]
Generally speaking, yeah. Okay, so we're going to the forest. Fishing.

Only made one check, right? Yes. Okay, so forest, common, fishing.

It's a... Alright, so this, it's very simple. This monstrosity deals 10 bludgeoning damage to the fissure and any adjacent creatures.

Has a vaguely humanoid face.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, you can see most of it, didn't I say?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, pretty much. You got a river monster, pretty much.

[Speaker 3]
Goddamnit, with a humanoid face. Was a 13 better?

[Speaker 1]
I think a 13 is a bomb fish.

[Speaker 3]
A BOMB FISH?! Well, I guess it was better that you caught a sea monster.

[Speaker 1]
Depends on whether or not you want to use the bomb. That's your call, not mine.

[Speaker 2]
You can, like, feed the Prince of the Deep a grenade. Why not? Don't worry about the humanoid face.

One can just stick an apple in its mouth or something and it'll be alright. We have to eat this.

[Speaker 3]
Goddamnit.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Well, that's everyone's check done, I believe. It's a success all around.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, okay, so you guys will arrive there. Not quite in no time. But as you travel through the Cloud Forest, you are not molested by the hide-behind.

Some of you will recall that it typically...

[Speaker 3]
I remember the hide-behind.

[Speaker 1]
Everybody remembers the hide-behind. So the hide-behind typically only attacks people inside of the... Typically only attacks people inside of the ravines in particular, or the lowlands.

This is actually a region of the Cloud Forest that is ostensibly rumored to be the home of Cloud Giants. But you have not seen anybody nearby matching that description.

[Speaker 3]
They got hidden behind unlucky. Cloud Giants are not a match for hide-behinds.

[Speaker 1]
Probably not, actually. So you will come across a very large hole in the ground. It has, once again, this computer architecture to it.

It resembles the Convergence Pits and the environment you found within. Except this time, you're not going through a portal. There is just a long, long lift down.

[Speaker 2]
A lift, you say? What is the Prince of the Deep depicted as? I've only ever read him by title.

Is he like a big frog person or something?

[Speaker 1]
Nope! He is depicted as having one rather large eye. A few tendril-like wires coming out of the back of his head.

Kind of like one of the Magic the Gathering sliver races. Yeah, those guys. Adapto-boys.

And the lower half of his body is always, always, always obscured.

[Speaker 2]
He's just like... The nice pictures of him, he's like in the bathtub, just like... Yeah, like the front part of my trailer.

What spells would I prepare for this? I could take Ceremony.

[Speaker 4]
Who wants to get married? We will marry the Prince of the Deep. And then he has to give us everything.

Because happy wife equals happy life.

[Speaker 2]
Marry him, then divorce him. Hell, you should have signed the prenup. Yeah, unlucky, no prenup.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so what do you guys do? You're sitting at the top of the lift?

[Speaker 2]
A lift, I guess. How does the lift operate? Standard lift mechanic.

Standard lift mechanics.

[Speaker 3]
You press a button, and it presumably takes you down. Let us press said button.

[Speaker 5]
Starts going up.

[Speaker 3]
No, no, no, no, no! It just disconnects in the ring.

[Speaker 1]
Starts floating in the air. Excellent. Just as Gygax intended.

[Speaker 4]
You push the button, and everything just collapses.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, nobody expects the self-destruct button next to it.

[Speaker 2]
If everyone's okay with possibly dying, get on the elevator.

[Speaker 3]
I have never been not okay with that. Or he's a very brave man.

[Speaker 1]
Care. Care man.

[Speaker 3]
Brave is the wrong one. He's stupid. It's worse.

The man has eight in, and if it could be lower, it would be.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to keep freedom of music. Freedom of music. Freedom of music!

[Speaker 3]
Very important principle.

[Speaker 2]
It was very clutch last session, now I'm just using music. You can head on down into the pit. I will cast light on my shield.

I do not have darkvision.

[Speaker 4]
I don't either. I have the glowy thingy.

[Speaker 2]
What's your glowy thingy?

[Speaker 4]
The driftglobe.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Para does have the driftglobe.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that close.

[Speaker 2]
Can the driftglobe do its daylight? It can also do once per day?

[Speaker 4]
It is the light or the daylight spell. And it cannot be used... If you use the daylight effect, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

But it hovers around you for like 60 feet.

[Speaker 2]
You should be pretty good with that then.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, you also don't have to let it float, you can just hold it. Like a torch. A very round torch.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, so you folks find yourselves descending for quite a long time.

[Speaker 5]
If Monk jumps as they go, does it shake anything or is it just fun for him?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, does it what?

[Speaker 5]
If Monk jumps while we're going down, is it just fun for him or does it shake the elevator?

[Speaker 1]
Maybe a little bit, but no, it's mostly just fun.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, that's what he's doing. He probably strikes poses as he does it each time.

[Speaker 1]
As you guys go further and further down, you keep coming across these locations that seem real for just a moment, like you're getting ready to stop off. They sort of fade into view. One of them is a planet that is burnt, very gaseous.

You almost feel ever so slightly heavier, like the air around you is quite literally heavy before it disintegrates away, or the image disintegrates and you continue moving downwards. It happens again with a realm of rather just simple polygons, just boxes composing almost everything with a vicious red light in the background composed of simple colors before it too fades away. Eventually you do reach the bottom, however, and it is a network of twisting tunnels, weird architecture that, again, this computer architecture just kind of like going upwards.

In the places you've seen it prior, the computer architecture, again, these bricks and blocks just composed of what looks to be copper wiring kept to a relatively strict blocky shape, right, in this place actually twists as it goes upwards and out beyond the confines of this hole to where it looks like it's twisting or is twisting into a new horizon.

[Speaker 5]
Monk tries to twist with it and he regrets it.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so.

[Speaker 5]
Probably doesn't like, oh, don't do that.

[Speaker 1]
We are going to do a skill challenge here. You guys need five successes. It's going to be primarily focused on navigation and failed checks are going to result in some damage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Jesus.

[Speaker 1]
Who wants to go first?

[Speaker 5]
Parallel. I was going to have Monk choose someone else besides him.

[Speaker 2]
What are we doing? Moving through tunnels. We're tunnel snakes.

We rule. Tunnel snakes rule. Tunnel snakes rule.

[Speaker 1]
My fat man launcher's reaction to that information.

[Speaker 5]
So what is the role exactly that we have to do?

[Speaker 1]
That's up to you guys. Like I said, it's primarily focused on navigation.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. So perception. Sure.

Hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I'm scared now. Can I do survival?

[Speaker 1]
Survival will do.

[Speaker 5]
Not that it matters because they're the same, but. Yeah. Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, Monk, what happened, buddy?

[Speaker 5]
You saw something shiny and cool or something.

[Speaker 1]
That seems reasonable to me.

[Speaker 2]
James, could I please use Arcana to try and recognize patterns and things of the workings of the way the tunnels. Absolutely.

[Speaker 1]
I will give you advantage on this, given that you have been studying the Deep's architecture for a hot minute.

[Speaker 2]
Time to roll bad regardless. 19's not bad. 19's not bad at all.

Should have brought the bum fish.

[Speaker 3]
We could still whip out the face fish. I don't know, Morgan could just try and grab the slowest people and run ahead with an Athletics.

[Speaker 1]
Athletics, okay. And then what would Zianna like to do?

[Speaker 3]
That's what I'm just thinking on. What was your Arcana for, Jack? Recognizing patterns.

That was my plan for Zianna.

[Speaker 2]
I can do... No, it's fine. I guess it's already rolled.

What proficiencies has she got?

[Speaker 3]
Religion, Arcana, Insight, Persuasion.

[Speaker 2]
End of list. Everything else is a plus, too.

[Speaker 4]
Use religion, pray for the correct answer.

[Speaker 2]
I did find out about this guy through religious texts, so you can probably look this up.

[Speaker 1]
Use a religious figure, technically. He's a demon lord.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, okay. Oh no.

[Speaker 2]
We're on a leyline, never fucking mind.

[Speaker 1]
Who did you guys think you were meeting up with?

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, I knew this guy was fucked. Boom, alright, Zianna got a 21, you're welcome.

[Speaker 3]
21 for religion. And, whoopsie. Nah, I did roll an Athletics.

I'm gonna let that one ride. I'm actually gonna get Ultralol'd up. I just remembered.

Here is a D8 for monk as well. Monk got a 16. Money.

[Speaker 5]
Yay, he didn't get distracted.

[Speaker 3]
Nah, Morgan's too good with the lay magics.

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah. Just whipped you with it. He was like, whoa, that's so cool.

And there's like an invisible force field, and he's like, okay, okay. I get the hint.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so we're gonna start off with Parah's 30. Parah starts off our little travel section by looking to the left of the swirling mess of event horizon computer architecture that is going into a new and separate horizon and sees a doorway to the left. No, but sees a panel of the wall that looks like it's meant to be opened.

And after a little bit of jiggering with the party and the help of Rana is able to recognize it as being a kind of access panel. So you guys begin traveling through this. It does still take you through this, again, this twisting event horizon but it makes it a lot easier to navigate because you're not worried about having access to flight or subject of gravity.

You're able to continue traveling in sort of a more enclosed space. You come across a number of snakes inside this server's way. They're composed of metal.

They have a number of holographic symbols running down the length of their spines all of which are red. Monk quickly got everybody recognized like the way around them despite the fact that you guys were in a relatively enclosed access panel. There's stuff like racks of coolant or computer cores that you guys wouldn't recognize or racks of fans that actually slide up and down.

So what Monk did was pretty much just kick them over and kick one of these racks over and the snakes kept avoiding as best they could the blades of spinning death.

[Speaker 5]
He's like, I'm going to show you the ancient and magical and mystical and intricate way to avoid all of this. And then he just kicks it. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
While Rana was passing she recognized some of the symbols on these particular snakes. They were different glyphs of access meant to project or open ways within the deep and certain realms resembling it. Certain layers of the abyss basically have the same function.

And was able to, once you guys reached the end of this access corridor just start drawing the glyphs out and you came across finally I'm going to pull up my description. You finally come across some stable ground in a vast spherical chamber filled with swirling mists of many different colors. There are luminescent tendrils of energy dancing through the air, pulsating and coming to rest on the walls of this particular area.

They are mostly blue or teal hued and somewhat transparent. And they keep pulsing with this rhythm. The walls of the chamber itself is like a set of shifting fractals which occasionally displays different landscapes.

Above the spherical chamber, because it has no ceiling you guys see a set of unfamiliar stars that are quite a bit closer wherever here is the other stars in the sky are quite a bit closer in relative distance. Kind of looks like the Pleiades, but if they were yellow. Must be something approximating daytime outside, but again the stars do remain visible.

This brings us to Xi'Ana. While Rana was examining the snakes Xi'Ana actually managed to collect or grab one of them just sort of forming a small, like a minor glyph against demons that she had prepared in advance and bottled up one of these snakes. She looked around the room, kept searching on the ground for something.

You guys find that the ground here has some kind of concentric, circular pattern where there's a number of rings, and then on some of these rings there are additional spheres they're sort of like embedded under the floor. Xi'Ana takes a moment. Doesn't really know which one to attempt this on until Morgan invokes a little bit of lay magic and one of the rings, the third outer ring and the second sphere on this particular ring highlights, and Xi'Ana goes over and just cracks this snake open.

Bleeding oil and green goop onto the sphere until it pops up released from its cage and forms a portal. Sick. I'm assuming you guys continue in.

There's a brief moment where gravity resets once again but Morgan is able to sort of dig his hand turn into claws in the process and start just grabbing people and hauling them inwards. So the ground finally resets and you're once again in this spherical chamber but now there is an actual ceiling to it and at the far end of the chamber is a figure with three eyes a metallic face mask or head or skull the majority of this creature is metallic though it has bark and greenery growing over the growing over the plating it does look reminiscent of Convergence has a number of tendrils splayed outside of its back has two large arms one of which ends in a hand and the other of which ends in a tube structure resembling a firearm it ends in basically a large tube with some kind of energy source hidden within

[Speaker 5]
looks like a gun

[Speaker 1]
looks like a gun there are a number of modrons and other drone species, I guess quadrons and such, pentadrones which are currently trying to erect spires out of the computer architecture building something of a great gate between themselves and the Prince of the Deep the Prince of the Deep is like halfway out of a hole at the other end of the spherical chamber you're back in one that much resembles the one prior except now there's a bunch of modrons, pentadrones and stuff like that in between you two which are currently trying to construct a gate or force field between you and the Prince of the Deep they have not actually noticed you yet

[Speaker 5]
that's the dude that is the dude, yes well...

should we just wave? Rana would try and wave everyone wave Rana's gonna wave everybody gather round you still have the bean, right?

[Speaker 2]
yes, I do I'm...

[Speaker 1]
we have some other things I have some other things that we can maybe here he says look down there and he points to a space in between the two gates where the sphere has opened up a little bit and is permeated by this white fluid that appears to be flowing out of certain portions of the sphere structure that you guys are in right now that is a very volatile liquid and it's actually what powers the Prince of the Deep and his servants you want us to

[Speaker 5]
turn it off?

[Speaker 1]
I think we could like try to I have something where we could like maybe try to corrupt it and maybe it will distract the rest of the servants but I would need to get close alright I don't really want to do that do you have to be the one to do it? no, no, absolutely not actually if somebody wants to just pour this in there how far is it?

[Speaker 5]
Monk hold his hand up

[Speaker 4]
like from our location

[Speaker 1]
probably a few hundred feet down let's say 250 feet over

[Speaker 4]
so we really couldn't just throw it

[Speaker 2]
I agree with Monk having it Monk's the fastest here probably I think if we pilfer Monk we can just try and just force it like we're playing American football

[Speaker 4]
I was hoping I had a speed spell

[Speaker 3]
if we won I could like guarantee success on a check because we're on a ley line if it comes down to a check I can just fucking put my remaining dice just on it I was like oh it's an acrobatic so the DC's like 40 I'm just like yeah okay here's 3d12 48 you're welcome just absolutely juice up that one check

[Speaker 4]
I can't believe clerics don't get feather fall right

[Speaker 1]
oh it's not down like fall damage far it's like over you're on a slight incline because you're on a sphere

[Speaker 2]
I think we just group up and try to make an opening for Monk to leg it run and dump it yep I think that's good if we corrupt this fluid what does that achieve? we're going to depower the prince of the deep I think we're going to depower the gate itself

[Speaker 3]
and then we've probably got a chance to give him like the thing we want him to eat right

[Speaker 1]
we have to actually get to him to present this being

[Speaker 2]
and what point do we need to be at to corrupt it with the fluid where do we need to get to to corrupt the fluid

[Speaker 1]
you just need to find a source of the fluid the most obvious source is like 250 feet down

[Speaker 2]
okay let's try and get to that then oh

[Speaker 5]
what exactly am I holding is it like a vial with liquid okay okay this doesn't really change what I wanted to do he's just going to like tuck it in his shirt in his waist belt cool

[Speaker 1]
we're going to take a quick 15 minute break and then we're going to come back to this and do some goofy nonsense

[Speaker 3]
my favorite type all right i'll be back soon all right we might be we might be a second longer than 15 minutes but we should not be much longer we'll be back

[Speaker 1]
we used a convergence run that was a really good fucking that was a really good night

[Speaker 4]
such a cute hairstyle

[Speaker 5]
I suppose the answer would be no no no

[Speaker 4]
what for me

[Speaker 5]
is it for you specifically or what you're drawing what I'm drawing is the answer no it's not cute or is it para what I don't know

[Speaker 4]
the hair just wasn't as long as I was attempting to make it it's just shoulder length and it was supposed to be like knee length but the shoulder length is so cute

[Speaker 1]
I guess put like a white line on this

[Speaker 6]
Augie what did you just do you scrubbed me all the way to the top of the chat how did you manage that

[Speaker 1]
good luck

[Speaker 5]
I had a cat once who she twisted twisted all the alignment on my computer so like it was upside down and right was left and left and up was down why are cats or children hackers I don't understand how they do the shit they do

[Speaker 4]
I always find the cool things that nobody ever knew existed and then you can't fix it

[Speaker 1]
I'm literally that's going on with my fucking Cinema 4D right now I'm literally downloading a new cracked version of Cinema 4D that one's not working alright I'm going to refill my coffee it was pretty good for a high resolution post also I got a blue sky account I have returned but I know it's not time yet

[Speaker 2]
so I'm going to do all the tape for you

[Speaker 1]
yes part of the issue for me nowadays for taking a lot of different effects from video games and stuff like that especially if I'm taking them from let's say Prince of the Deep is reminiscent of a certain science fantasy video game or is inspired by a certain science fantasy video game is that if those video games don't have any kind of boss mechanics besides shoot the thing until it dies like bullet sponge and sometimes it might disappear during the middle of a fight and then you have to fight a bunch of its minions or it'll go invincible for a little while and you have to go fight a bunch of its minions which is pretty much the same thing it makes it a little bit difficult to run through the I guess alternative gameplay options but I think I figured I usually just start practicing with ChatGBT for a hot minute and then I ignore everything ChatGBT says because I found the answer that's what I got right now

[Speaker 5]
what did you say?

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to draw a braid and I'm trying to make it go from sort of a thin to a thick because it's the end of the braid and it got really thick really fast so I'm trying to make it that's normally my reaction to Twitter board I tweaked my shoulder today what'd you do that for?

[Speaker 2]
because I got bored my body was doing okay I needed to not be okay I don't remember what I did but it was at work so I could've been lifting a kid up or fucking sweeping artistic bread?

[Speaker 5]
did you do bread art?

[Speaker 4]
it looks like a challah to be fair, challah is braided what kind of bread is that? my goodness it is one of the best breads for french toast you know what I always think about when I hear chat GPT?

[Speaker 6]
What do you hear?

[Speaker 4]
So there was a Tumblr post going around where a French person was like, I hate hearing about chat GPT all the time. Because in French, chat GPT means cat, I farted. Interesting.

[Speaker 1]
I wasn't expecting that. I was really not expecting that. Now, I know that the French are a despicable and horrifying race of people, right?

Definitely don't deserve rights, you know, nothing but problems. The French, okay, fine.

[Speaker 5]
Is it like how you pronounce the word? Yeah. Yeah, GPT.

[Speaker 1]
Who knows what pronunciation is in French?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's amazing.

[Speaker 1]
I wish it was easier to take notes on this thing, but you know, I'm going to try.

[Speaker 4]
Would they have changed the proficiencies for clerics? That's a good question.

[Speaker 1]
I thought you started off with, you pretty much always started off with religion, maybe athletics.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I mean like for the armor. Ew. Because I remember when I was building my character in my other game, I didn't have armor proficiency, but I'm seeing a lot of clerics wearing armor in the images.

In Pathfinder. And I know they're doing a remaster.

[Speaker 5]
Apologies, it took slightly longer. You're grounded.

[Speaker 3]
True. Well, it's a good thing I have extra time to recuperate by being perfectly on time to the session start as well.

[Speaker 5]
That's true, you were on time, I suppose.

[Speaker 3]
I think you can forgive me, I'm so on time.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'm going to go recover my coffee, which is sitting in the microwave.

[Speaker 5]
You're on time.

[Speaker 4]
I know they added druids are no longer limited to not being able to wear metal. Because now metal is an element. But I also think Pathfinder had wooden armor, so...

[Speaker 2]
James would have just sniped him instead.

[Speaker 4]
No, sorry, it's a spell. It is a spell that has you grow armor.

[Speaker 1]
You're banned. I'm sniping their character concepts right now for Monolith.

[Speaker 4]
That's an anime girl, I don't want an anime girl. I'm tired of anime girls. If I join a campaign and I see an anime, I'm just leaving.

[Speaker 3]
Understandable. That's fine, I got my new anime profile. It's good, it's great, it's fantastic.

Banging. Can't read the text with a little pink stance as anime addict on it. Next to his head.

Banging.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the last anime crew that I let myself join, it was normal until they gave me access to the NSFW channels, and the first thing I saw was an armpit channel. Classic.

[Speaker 7]
Most normal anime fans.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know how you expected anything else.

[Speaker 4]
It was the most active channel. Even more active than the non-NSFW ones. Most normal anime fans.

[Speaker 1]
What were the other NSFW channels?

[Speaker 4]
Maybe that's all they had. One was for guns. One was for guns.

I think they had... I don't remember.

[Speaker 1]
Two Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Firearms and armpits.

[Speaker 4]
Hahaha! The deal breaker was when they were like... One, the DM had to argue with them for like five days that they could not play a racist character because they always take it too far.

Why can't I play that one like...

[Speaker 1]
Listen, I really want to play that one half-elf exclusive character archetype that's dedicated to the murder of human-elf pairings. That actually... I was introduced to this...

I don't know if it was Pathfinder 3.5, but it's like the anti-miscegenation half-elf exclusive class. Like the pain of being a half-elf has made you so racist you go out and kill it. I was like...

Fucking White Wolf must have written this. I don't understand. I was inconsolable.

[Speaker 4]
The thing is, none of them ever play anything other than human. And I think I was brought in to try and combat that because I... The DM was like, you should play a drow.

And I hop in and they're like, all humans.

[Speaker 3]
One of my friends that doesn't play as much day-in-day-out just wanted to play a drow for Baldur's Gate. My goodness, they're getting sick of every single fucking NPC being like, Oh, you're a drow! Oh, we're dead!

Every time. I get it, but I wish there was a warning for this shit. We were talking about doing the RPG channel, weren't you guys?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I wish that the drow got a neutral, like, Hey, whoa guys, I'm not an evil drow. I'm not a loft-worshipping drow. I'm just a surface drow.

So maybe don't freak the fuck out, but no. When I get someone who freaks out because I'm a drow, my options are intimidate them or kill them. And it's like, okay, can I have a non-asshole route here?

[Speaker 3]
She went back to one of the traders back and forth, and they were a hobgoblin, and she's just pissed because at the start of every interaction of trying to use the shop, just right at the top is brackets drow. Aren't your people usually slaves around here? And she's just like, man, I don't fucking want this shit.

Can I strike this so I never see it again? Can I not be this kind of character? She's playing a good cleric, so she doesn't want to fucking...

[Speaker 1]
Good is in quotes.

[Speaker 3]
The annoying part to me...

[Speaker 1]
No, but she's a drow, I mean, come on.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna do flashbacks! Because there's two drow. There's the loth-worshipping evil drow, and then there's the not-loth-worshipping drow that have rejected her.

[Speaker 1]
I thought it was pretty cool that you put an option in choosing your subrace for like, oh, we're splitting this up by who we worship, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but it doesn't give you any other options.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I've seen at least one or two, it's more knowledge-based stuff, like history checks and shit. Or like, I think it was on one of the checks, where they're like, oh, you're a drow, are you gonna enslave us now?

And she's like, no, I don't serve loth. And that's a specific, like, the other drow.

[Speaker 4]
And why is it on every interaction like that?

[Speaker 3]
Well, here's the thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't know. So they only have one visual indicator for what kind of elf you are, and it's the backdrop.

[Speaker 3]
That is true as well, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think I picked halfling for the one I'm doing right now.

[Speaker 2]
Some of the examples they used in that Twitter rant about racism was like, eh, it's a bit of a stretch. Like they're gonna kill the child because they stole the important artifact for their ritual, not because they're a d-boy.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That lady was just like a fucking asshole in general.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like...

[Speaker 1]
I don't think she's meant to come across as any kind of decent person.

[Speaker 4]
No. No, like, you literally... I hated her more after I read her brain in that quest.

[Speaker 3]
I hated her before, and I didn't ever read her brain, and there's no need. She seemed to wear her disgustingness, like, pretty plainly.

[Speaker 1]
She had a consistent, like, just tone that was, like, smug for no apparent fucking reason.

[Speaker 4]
The thing I hate is her animation. I don't understand her animation. Her head, like, chicken-bops as she's like, Um, excuse me, I am here chilling children.

You need to get out of my grove.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you're ruining my vibe. My child-killer vibe. That's what all annoying people of specific persuasion look like when they're being annoying.

[Speaker 3]
I think I like... Because I looked at the Baldur's Gate magic set after I finished the game, I'm pretty sure she has, like, a card where it just calls her evil. On the card.

Like, she's specifically named it. It says ELF BITCH right on the big capital letters. I'm finding it right.

Shadow Archdruid. Yeah, there it is. Hey, she is a rat.

[Speaker 1]
Is that what she turns into? I don't know. Is that, like, her favorite form?

[Speaker 4]
No, her favorite form's probably a snake, because that's what she's using.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's right, that's right. Now, it's funnier to call her a rat.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. So is Jerry Seinfeld.

[Speaker 1]
What's the deal with these horned ones? If you know what I mean. Why don't we just purge them from the gene pool?

Yeah, if I'm going to play the racist rat, I'm going to pull out the guy who plays the racist rat.

[Speaker 5]
We're paying the left back for you, buddy.

[Speaker 3]
I hope whatever agents ascribe to listening to my phone walks up to my house and is like, What the fuck, man? I had to listen to that shit, man. Come on.

Be reasonable. Like, my superior was like, Just go fucking arrest him. I'm like, No, no, no, this is normal.

He's just a freak. I had to defend you, man.

[Speaker 4]
Unloggy. I really hope that Baldur's Gate puts their mod thinger through, and we can just change everybody's voice to whatever files we want.

[Speaker 1]
That would be incredible. And we'll start voicing characters.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, are you folks ready for your dive down into the deep?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, from us. Sure thing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. So, your objective is on the other side of this location. The alchemist has clarified that it's going to fuck with the constructs here.

If you manage to dump whatever it is that you're trying to dump inside the local pool, you are free to do as much combat or as little combat as you wish, because after this, it's going to be mostly puzzles.

[Speaker 3]
Sick. Cool. I was just checking, do I have useful spell prepared?

And as always, the answer is usually no. Excellent. Sorry, I have conjure animals.

Do we need animals? I can make animals. You want anything else?

[Speaker 4]
What's the fastest animal you could make?

[Speaker 3]
I like birds.

[Speaker 4]
Could they drag Monk away?

[Speaker 3]
I think we're just going to see how fucked up Monk gets, because if Monk, if everything just misses him, and he gets down there and pours the ketamine in the Prince of the Deep's open maw, then I think we're good. But if he needs a...

[Speaker 4]
I don't think I have anything that can raise his... Why is my spells gone? I have not used spells yet.

I don't have anything that can raise his AC.

[Speaker 1]
We're going to do group initiative for this one as well.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't roll my initiative. Someone else did.

[Speaker 1]
I did. I was initially just trying to see who would go first, enemies or whatever.

[Speaker 2]
I could cast Shield of Faith on Monk.

[Speaker 3]
That's probably a good idea.

[Speaker 2]
I will do that. Go get him, buddy.

[Speaker 4]
Can you stack Shield of Faith? I do not think so.

[Speaker 3]
Pretty sure almost every spell effect... It's hard-coded into the 5e spell rules that you can't get two benefits of the same effect.

[Speaker 4]
Lame.

[Speaker 3]
Fucking horseshit, man. So I'm pretty sure I have two different bards bardic you. I don't think you can...

With bardic inspiration, it's slightly different. Okay, bardic... Maybe that's just spells that are hard-coded then.

They've done something. Fuck you, the bastards. Monk-hating fisters.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, how often are you going to have seven clerics with one guy and just everyone...

[Speaker 3]
Shield of Faith. We have seven clerics versus one guy and he thinks they're just a bunch of priests and they all Guiding Bolt him and he fucking turns to dust. It's like, they're only level one clerics!

Laserbeam is us. As I've played fighters in different... Fighters in 5e are fun.

Fighters in Pathfinder are also fun. More fun, but also fun. Seeing monks in other systems though makes me weep for Landy.

Made you play so long in a system that treats monks poorly. My sins are unforgivable.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Stolov. Who is stoning us off?

[Speaker 2]
You said... Shield of Muscle. Shield of Faith on monk.

I'm going to move forward 30 feet as we start pushing forward. I'm going to activate... Oops.

The joys of 5e. I can't activate my animated shield and cast Shield of Faith. They're both bonus actions.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. All right, monk. Zianna's got you.

[Speaker 7]
Off you go.

[Speaker 5]
All right, so I'm just going to take all of my action to run.

[Speaker 4]
Does that give you a plus 4 to your AC? Yep. Yeah, that's plus 4.

[Speaker 3]
That's a different effect, so that definitely stacks. And you get an extra dash. So your move speed is...

[Speaker 4]
I'm also going to Sanctuary you. Holy crap.

[Speaker 3]
Monk, what's your move speed?

[Speaker 5]
45.

[Speaker 3]
Your move speed is 90 and you have an extra action to dash a turn.

[Speaker 5]
Holy crap. So I can dash like 4 times? Or 3 times.

[Speaker 3]
You can dash 3 times.

[Speaker 5]
3 times, yeah. Well... Who gets you in this?

[Speaker 2]
Just your regular dash gets you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Well, so the haste action. The haste action is less versatile.

So you want a haste action dash? You can just get there. Okay.

Sick combat, James, we say as we launch monk out of a railgun at the objective. That's totally... Listen, if you want to do that, it's totally fine.

[Speaker 1]
I just put the enemies on the board here so that if you didn't do that you would get shot a whole bunch.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, boom. Puzzle solved. Look at us go to the puzzle.

[Speaker 5]
Puzzle solved, ladies! He gets there and he's like, Whoa! That's a lot.

And then he stares at it and he's like, What was I supposed to do? Shit. And he pads his body.

And then he's like, Oh, the vial! And then he does it.

[Speaker 3]
Arcademania.

[Speaker 5]
He's like, Okay, here I go. And then he'll look back at you guys like, Two thumbs up. Yeah, pretty much.

Did it!

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Let's see here. The...

The representatives, Oak and Bolters, on the map here are currently now beginning to turn on each other. They have green eyes as opposed to their normal eyes. And begin shooting at one another.

But they will also continue shooting at you. Starting with Para. This is Monk.

This will be versus Rana.

[Speaker 3]
Myths. You got the count up! Oh no!

[Speaker 1]
And finally, Morgan.

[Speaker 2]
Fuck off! Hold on. No crit.

I have my cleric feature.

[Speaker 1]
You gonna use it? Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

Alright. 9 damage versus Yana. And...

Normal damage for 19 versus Morgan.

[Speaker 2]
What the fu- Why'd it roll so high?! Just be glad there were only 2 damage.

[Speaker 3]
How dare you touch my 124 health characters. That's definitely all the health he has. I'm sure I won't find more.

[Speaker 1]
The bolter shoots at Morgan.

[Speaker 2]
Rana just whips out one of her bells and chimes it. Softens the blow. Does the Yana lose concentration on haste?

[Speaker 3]
I doubt it. Oh no, the DC's 10, right? Yeah.

I guarantee not, I think. Do you have thingies for that? Trawler.

Constitution check?

[Speaker 2]
Blimey. What was that, Caleb?

[Speaker 3]
Hold up.

[Speaker 1]
What are the odds?!

[Speaker 3]
Hold up, hold up. Where is it? Favoured by the gods, this one?

Okay, boom. Beautiful. More details?

2d4. Okay. Now we're good.

Yeah, what was that? 11! Let's go!

Fuck! I'm so mad I rolled a 2. I'm like, I get it.

But as I committed to rolling 1 in my head, I was like, I can't commit more because I feel like it's going to be a 2 and it'd feel like cheating to me. And then I rolled a 2 and mad at myself. And you rolled the minimum.

It was two 1s on the d4s.

[Speaker 2]
How's it not 1 on the save as well? Physically?

[Speaker 3]
If the physically I could roll lower is 1 less on my dice and then it's still a pass!

[Speaker 4]
I could roll to increase it. What do you need to get? Blankest cow.

[Speaker 3]
Blankest cow. It's just a con save for maintaining haste. We're good.

We're good. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, okay. So, the gate that would normally stretch across the front pillars here is currently down. But the gate that is currently stretched across the...

What's in here? Oh, I just need... I'll just draw a door across this way.

You guys can see that, right?

[Speaker 2]
There is a door.

[Speaker 1]
I literally just stretched across. So the one right in front of you is fading in and out of existence.

[Speaker 2]
You guys are going to have to try to jump through it while it's flickering.

[Speaker 5]
I was picturing him jumping in and out. Like, ooh, I'm over here. Now I'm over here.

[Speaker 1]
It'll just be a dexterity acrobatics check or saving throw if you prefer to go through it.

[Speaker 2]
Do I need to do anything on this map or are we doing that check now?

[Speaker 1]
No, you're starting off with that check. So that's stretched right in front of you guys.

[Speaker 2]
Can I cast a spell before I make the check?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Yeah, it's up to you guys.

[Speaker 2]
I'm getting proficiency in acrobatics. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
Nice.

[Speaker 1]
You've never seen a more graceful dwarf bear. Twirl through me.

[Speaker 3]
I fucking love that he got the highest of everyone.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I think we just need Para.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm trying to decide if I wanted to give myself advantage or not. Of course. Why wouldn't you?

I should've. Para takes 10 bludgeoning damage. Are we in light?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Bright light in this location. Alright, so Para gets bounced out the other end, ejected next to everybody else after a small mishap. Okay.

So a few enemies are going to phase in. Attempting to defend the master's holdings. The tethers are currently locked.

You guys might remember from the Convergence Pits. All of the tether boxes and hashes were locked upon the appearance of Pentatron. And with that, you guys have the higher initiative, so I will let you go first.

[Speaker 3]
Let me read. Unlucky. How high is the ceiling in here?

The church is pretty high up.

[Speaker 1]
It's at least 1,000 feet in the air. Oh, hell yeah. You can fly around.

[Speaker 3]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Let me guess. Who did Kaz call lightning?

[Speaker 3]
You know, like, sounds pretty good. Look at that. Look at that circle.

That's amazing.

[Speaker 2]
It's a haste, though.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
How many rounds into haste are we? Oh, you guys still have it. Yeah, but it only lasts 10 rounds, so in case this combat goes long.

Yeah, just in case. So, like, down 1 or 2? You'll probably, okay, round 5, you'll probably lose haste.

Round 5, okay. It's very important, because if we get to round 5, that means Monk loses a turn.

[Speaker 2]
He does still have shield. It's 10 minutes. Already?

[Speaker 5]
I feel like he's just, like, glowing.

[Speaker 3]
This is a level 4 one, too. This is not stormy conditions. This is a 4d10 bolt.

Do we want me to zap a pentadrone, or do we want me to snap two of the little gamer boys?

[Speaker 2]
I think the pentadrone's better.

[Speaker 3]
Pentadrone? All right, well, I'm just going to pick the one. This one dead in front of us.

Deck save, please, James. Just fails. 15 lightning to him.

[Speaker 1]
All right, it's, like, roughly half a zipline speed.

[Speaker 3]
Fuck yeah. I don't need bonus action shit that's good. I've got room.

[Speaker 2]
Can I please have that same pentadrone make a wisdom save? Is that the end of your movement, Jack? Yeah, that's my...

Boom. Oh, it's dead. Whoops.

So, for many episodes, D12, smorgasbord. You're welcome. The animated chill run is done.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Monxiana and Bera, what do you got for us?

[Speaker 5]
I can just go punchy-punchy.

[Speaker 4]
I have no repeat. I can sit under the bear, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

[Speaker 5]
What exactly does haste give me?

[Speaker 3]
All right, that top left measured template. Can I get some more deck saves? Ziana launched a fireball there.

Oh, jeez. All righty.

[Speaker 5]
I'm glad I haven't gone yet. I probably would have been in that. No, you wouldn't.

Oh.

[Speaker 3]
25 fire. Yeah. I don't think the monodrones can do anything to that.

I think they're a waste.

[Speaker 4]
Monodrones are just dead.

[Speaker 3]
A pentadrone takes 25.

[Speaker 1]
Quadrones. Quadrones are bad. Yeah, I can see it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, those are quadrones, not monodrones. Two of them are quadrones. Yeah, there's quadrones around the map.

They assumed all the medium creatures were monodrones. Whoops.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no, so the pentadrones are the big guys.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The pentadrones are the big guys. I just assumed all the little ones were monodrones, but there's some quadrones sneaking in there.

The bastards. So, yeah, the quadrones survived?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. One of them survived.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so with a quick end spell, that guy's copping an Eldritch Blast, the quadrone is. All righty.

[Speaker 4]
I don't think your critical hit is correct.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, that doesn't seem right to me.

[Speaker 4]
1d6. Does not seem like a critical hit. How did that happen?

I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
How much damage does somebody who plays monks a lot, wink wink, what's the unarmed strike dice at this? That Eldritch Blast misses, that first one does?

[Speaker 3]
This was the second one's at the quadrone and it crits. Excellent.

[Speaker 2]
Unarmed strike dice at d8 is level 11, I believe. I just induct to the bathroom quickly.

[Speaker 1]
And monk is, okay, so he's still at d6, but it should be at least 2d6, post-modifier.

[Speaker 2]
Critical, yeah. Yeah, so slash roll. It says that it's roll critical.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So it should be a 10 instead.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe the critical scaling's not... That's just the default one though, isn't it? Bless you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, people say bless you as well. In any case, this thing is dead. He's perished.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, no.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not giving her a medal.

[Speaker 5]
I guess with the rest of my turn I'll go to the next one. Pick them off one by one.

[Speaker 1]
Monk is just giving them noogies.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Just burrowing into the... It kind of feels like the really small ones have armor that just kind of feels like aluminum foil. It's really easy to crunch them.

They're like really big basketballs, so if you lifted both of them, if you lifted them with both hands, you'd probably be able to crunch them.

[Speaker 2]
And you were pretty strong, you could probably crunch them with both hands. You'd still have more attacks with Monk.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was just realizing that. I just got distracted. No, it's okay.

I've got like one more arm. I think I've got one more hit.

[Speaker 1]
That 15 just misses, Para.

[Speaker 5]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
That 15 also just misses. Wait, no, no. I guess the monodrome is just it.

And there's no way you can't kill it. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Is that everybody?

Is that everybody's turn? Alrighty. So we're going to have the pentatrons go first.

Actually, which one? Where does this one go?

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Monk, go ahead and make that save.

[Speaker 5]
I have a decent constitution. Yeah! There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, you know what? Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
No, I think this one's going to be good. No. It's too funny not to.

Better make another con save.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. He looks like he... He looks like he keeps tripping.

Like, oh shit, I dropped my flask. Oh shit, cool rock.

[Speaker 7]
Whoa.

[Speaker 5]
Whoa.

[Speaker 1]
There's these two. This one's going to come along.

[Speaker 2]
What's Monk's AC with plus 4?

[Speaker 5]
It's... 22. It's also going to dash.

[Speaker 1]
There's a reason they were trying to paralyze him first.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and... So yeah, you can just keep boosting him up. There's those.

He has the technology.

[Speaker 5]
Let's one by one kill all of them.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, features. This is going to do a ranged javelin attack as it walks along. Amazing.

I think I'm close enough to negate that.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, you know what? Yeah. Would you like to use your reaction to negate that?

I cannot. I am not close enough.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I meant... I meant Monk. I wasn't sure.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I wasn't exactly sure who was being hit.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so you want an echo to do this. Do you want to throw it back?

[Speaker 5]
Uh huh.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, if you hit he dies.

[Speaker 5]
He catches it and then spins around and throws it back.

[Speaker 1]
He missed.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
None of you thought of it once. Okay, um... This quadra run over here.

[Speaker 2]
Bone attack multiple times. It's the only time this...

[Speaker 5]
What the fuck? I wish I could say that wasn't normal for me.

[Speaker 1]
I told you to turn off that audio a bit. Okay, so that's 17 damage total, I guess. I think he does have to move.

He has to... He has to...

[Speaker 5]
I usually am not this popular.

[Speaker 1]
God, I have that cool fucking module that tells me how far people have to go. It's so good. This is so handy.

Alright, that is your turn to come to round two.

[Speaker 2]
Mr. Morgan, make some lightning strike if you want.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, Mr. Morgan's not here, but I'll roll it for him. Hell yeah, let's roll it.

[Speaker 5]
He's pretty good with a 5-sword.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, I'll cast it...

[Speaker 3]
I'll cast it on this square. So it hits those three guys. So that's the damage, and they just make saves.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, and it's... Yeah, it's these three guys, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yep. Ah, bastards.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah. That guy now has four hit points. These two now have 23 hit points.

Fuck.

[Speaker 5]
Did I... Am I included in the call lightning right now?

[Speaker 2]
It's over the right-hand side. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
There are so many lines and colors.

[Speaker 1]
The bolt that hits... ...is against this guy, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
So now when Monk hits him, he has advantage. Is it just on the next attack?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. I'd like to tell the dad to enter drone at the back of the call lightning... ...if he can make a wisdom save. Poo D12. Such a D12 roll. D12, rolling along.

You roll for fucking ages. It's always bad. That's my experience.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Ziana and Monk, what are y'all doing?

[Speaker 3]
It's coming at you live... ...in a brave display.

[Speaker 5]
I can reach this guy, right? Can I reach this guy from where I am?

[Speaker 1]
Or do I need to move to... Okay. This guy's dead.

There's nobody in melee with him. Okay. I was just thinking diagonally.

[Speaker 5]
Wait. What am I doing?

[Speaker 1]
You have advantage! We'll do the attack roll with advantage. He's got a gunny bolt on him right now.

Yeah! That hits. Harsh.

[Speaker 7]
What? Whoa.

[Speaker 1]
Whoa. Whoa. What a hit.

Alright, and then you have a second attack. What is that? Are you trying to make it?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, I'm trying.

[Speaker 7]
Yes! Yay! Yes!

[Speaker 3]
Dish out the death. Awesome. I'll wait to see how much death is dealt, and then...

...figure out who's getting dealt with the blaster.

[Speaker 5]
I'll move over to the next guy.

[Speaker 2]
Do you have an attack for that guy?

[Speaker 5]
No, but I can move over this time. That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
He's got a haste action attack. Oh yeah, you have one extra.

[Speaker 5]
Cool, okay. No, just one at a time. Just one at a time.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, well he's dead. Terrorist. Nope.

[Speaker 3]
So now we'll take out that last monodrone on the right, hopefully. There we go. 21 hits.

You have more than... Five fourths, doesn't he? Yay!

Good point. Let's go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, literally all that's up on the board right now is... Quadro... Is that everybody's attacks, movements, stuff like that?

I think so.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Quadrone is going to go over here. I'll tell you what, I'm going to have the drone go down here.

Yes. Alright, Monk. You know the drill.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, Ann. Oh cool, y'all came to me! That's real cool.

Hang on, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Understandable. Alright, this one is going to just... Use its multi-target.

Times.

[Speaker 2]
Nope. Nope. Nope.

Nope. Ann!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that one fails. And then we have Quadrone. Big money, big money.

It's 20 big money.

[Speaker 5]
No. 22. Because it's 18 plus 4.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, those are all their turns. Guys will...

[Speaker 5]
I think Monk just kind of takes a drink.

[Speaker 3]
Are either of the Pentadrones damaged? Uh, yes. In fact, this one is...

Left one, deck safe.

[Speaker 2]
Ah shit, there's a mate.

[Speaker 3]
And then, I bear forward. I may have bared prematurely. I just hope the head breaks.

Well listen, I can keep it for hours, but if we need to cost Conjure Animals in any of these puzzles coming up, then it's sad.

[Speaker 2]
Is it taking damage? Just the Pentadrone. Yeah.

I'll target the Pentadrone. Is he being hurt? He's not actually.

The only two enemies left in the board have no damage. Alright. It's going to save, it's just breaking damage for this one.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, what else have we got? Xiana will... Scorching Ray.

Just roll 3 at the Pentadrone to start with. 3 points. Miss.

No. Nooooo. It's a disaster.

Alright, well. Hopefully this goes a little better. No.

A little better for that. Yes! Whoopsie.

Yup. 60 in force.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it is not working well. I think that's it.

[Speaker 3]
Nah. Fine, that's enough. It has a bear next to it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that is... Heroic. Hero and Monk.

[Speaker 4]
I'm guessing Nessie is not right here, so I'm going to send a Sacred Flame at the little box.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. 19. Yep.

We're about as well as I... Oh no! Damage is damage.

It doesn't have that many in force.

[Speaker 4]
Nessie rolled damage on something that had like 4 dice, and it was 3 ones and a 3.

[Speaker 1]
Is that in this campaign?

[Speaker 4]
No, it was in my last one.

[Speaker 1]
It sounds very familiar. I feel so bad when that happens. Especially to me.

[Speaker 2]
It's better not have Potent Spellcasting.

[Speaker 3]
Cleric's got that way later.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry?

[Speaker 3]
I think Cleric's got that super late.

[Speaker 1]
Or maybe I'm remembering wrong. I think it might be 8th level after Asha's. But yeah, alright, so...

Nessie... Or sorry, Monk is going to kill these two.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! My Life Cleric gets Divine Strike every time. I forgot it was half and half.

It's a plus. It's like a virtual 4 for all the subclasses.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, there's also Blessed Strikes.

[Speaker 2]
You can't replace any.

[Speaker 3]
But if you take Blessed Strikes, you don't get Divine Strike.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, but I don't fucking ever use my melee.

[Speaker 2]
So yeah, it is 8th then. I know, I'm really upset about that. Some domains get Potent Spellcasting, others get...

I'm doing this Kobold, who's like small enough to be needed across canyons.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so you can add 7 to that.

[Speaker 5]
Already?

[Speaker 3]
No, you've got bigger friends to make. Much bigger friends to make in melee, James. Large bear-shaped friend.

I'm going to cast Reduce on you. I'm just going to start hard targeting you. You're going to get me down.

Give me the stats of a huge cave bear, but I'm medium-sized. Oh-ho-ho-ho. I'm going to go the full circle of life back to medium.

Don't worry, we haven't got it yet, but if someone casts... Oh no, we did have that, I think. I think we had one session where someone...

I think it was against the gold dragon. We made Morgan in his bear form bigger again. So we had to cast it.

It was fantastic. Everything I've ever dreamed of.

[Speaker 1]
A bear to touch the heavens. 10 minutes for Anessi to come back, and then you can puzzle time. Easy.

If you are clever enough, you shall have the book in your hands by the end of the night.

[Speaker 2]
Yes! Give it to me. I would ever be clever.

You're risking your lives to give me this book, by the way. I have no reward for you.

[Speaker 3]
Morgan hasn't had a reward for anything he's done. Sorry, wanted a reward. He's got given heaps of rewards, but for example, if he just never saw any money out of the fucking unicorn horn heist, he never would have known the difference.

My man just exists to come along in adventures vibe and live in a tree trunk. Have your own tree trunk. I'm so excited.

Just tell me whenever you need me to remove the money from my character sheet, for I will forget.

[Speaker 2]
How much of it are you? Probably just remove it now. Construction has started.

Okay. It'll just take 120 days. Yep, so yeah, just tell me how much of my gold that is, and if you need to borrow any more gold for building other areas, just hit me up.

I think I've already rinsed you pretty hard. Zianna's covering the tower.

[Speaker 3]
Zianna's covering the tower, easy. Ah, so. 8,000.

Do you have money on your sheet?

[Speaker 2]
16. 22,000 from Morgan. 22,000 from Morgan.

Yes. Excellent. That's fine.

[Speaker 3]
Because you are borrowing for another area as well, as well as him funding.

[Speaker 2]
Or is that, that's not just the group, is it? You're funding two of the temples and the establishments. Oh, okay.

Yeah, I thought so. All right, cool. Excellent.

They're going to be so kidded after all those builds. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine. Morgan's just here to help out. He wouldn't know what to do with anything more than like 50 gold to buy a fuckin' world's fanciest burger.

He'd be like, fuck yeah, man.

[Speaker 2]
Once Rana has this book, I'll get Maia to steal some shit again so we can make some moolah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you need a fuckin' HP sponge for an adventure, he's down. Because even if everything goes wrong and you have like a party full of rogues, you can just roll Morgan at something and buy you enough time to do whatever you want.

[Speaker 2]
Steal the sun.

[Speaker 4]
And you take the moon. Yeah, I could send Teakwood on a heist. That's originally what I built him for, was to go steal shit from the castle.

Because I thought that's where the Queen's diary would be. And then we didn't end up doing that part of the quest.

[Speaker 2]
Not the Queen that no longer exists anymore.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
But the other. I tried keeping up with that ordeal, but I have no clue. So confusing.

[Speaker 1]
Host has limited power. Survive at all costs.

[Speaker 2]
Do I raw dog my psychology assignment and just do the multiple choice quiz without studying? Jesus.

[Speaker 3]
Listen, man. I don't know what I believe.

[Speaker 2]
If they really wanted me to learn the content, then they should have made different questions that you can't Google. Here are my psychology study cards. You'll find someone's uploaded and it's literally the exact questions in the quiz.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's why Mr. Hydes, when we were ever doing prep for all of our math things, he's like, alright, we are just going to, we've taught you the concepts, taught you the lessons. Now all we're going to do is just do as many practice HSCs as possible and you just do every HSC from the past like 20 years and like half the questions, I'm like, I remember this question. Schooling isn't a scam, I promise.

[Speaker 4]
I found out a majority of doctors don't really remember their schooling. They just look it up on Google later.

[Speaker 3]
It's not taught in a way that sticks. This is fucking disgusting.

[Speaker 4]
I think doctors should be required to take like a communications class. Everyone should be required in high school.

[Speaker 3]
Disgusting animals out in the wild.

[Speaker 1]
Now they're using it to clean rugs and make whipped cream. What the, what is that gun?

[Speaker 4]
It's a massage gun. Have you never seen the Punch Bastards?

[Speaker 1]
It's a pillow gun. But it's like very specific.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, yes, they have attachments for that.

[Speaker 2]
It's awesome.

[Speaker 4]
No, it's like the stupid Theragun thing. I hate the Theragun. The one I have is a lot better because it's not like fucking eviscerating you, but still, you know.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder if they make like a wearable holster. Hey, I'm back. Heyo.

[Speaker 4]
Instead of the typical vibration, it goes back and forth. The one I have is my cat's favorite thing. I will be using it on my hands and he will run in and just be like, um, my face now, please.

Thank you. Let's see, do I have an image of him?

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Alright, so. I think we have everybody.

Excellent, alright. So, let's get everybody back. Um.

You guys will be able to tether and make it past the new forcefield barrier, which was already fading by the time you reached it. But you won't be required to actually, like, come through it or attempt to make any deck saves or anything like that. And then in front of you lies the Prince of the Deep, who is currently attempting to shoot some of the infected pentadrones and, uh, Cyclopses that he's currently firing on.

And messing with its programming. The Alchemist you guys have been traveling with presents you with the, uh, oh wait, I don't know, Rana already has it.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's got the bean.

[Speaker 3]
The bean time.

[Speaker 2]
Pulls it out of the pouch. Here, boy, got a snack for you.

[Speaker 1]
Now, one of its lot, one of its, uh, one of its eyes kind of engorges, uh, gets really, really big, and starts yanking the bean in, inward.

[Speaker 2]
I will let it have it.

[Speaker 1]
Once it makes contact with the eye, uh, the eye actually recedes into, like, a pouch or compartment Inside the Prince, its head falls to the ground, and the Alchemist points a receded eye and says, alright, I think we go inside there.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's do it.

[Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 3]
Step that in.

[Speaker 5]
Crawl inside.

[Speaker 3]
There.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so, you guys crawl in, and you do get to encounter a rather similar computer architecture to everything else. Most of the stuff in here, instead of made of copper, it's quite clearly made of an adamantine alloy. There are a few garnets from this creature.

They're used to refract light or transmit light-bound information. You can probably find about three rubies with 100 gold pieces each.

[Speaker 2]
That is your payment, minions. I can keep tabs of that if you would like.

[Speaker 3]
I would like you to do that. You can decide what you're gonna pay us at the end.

[Speaker 2]
That was 100 gold piece rubies in those three of them. Beautiful. Thank you.

Let's loot this box.

[Speaker 5]
So he's just laying mouth open?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, and you guys have, it sounds like, just walked through his eye. Open eye hole. You guys are now in a room that kind of looks like a voice box.

There are three major components of note in here. The first of which is a set of three doors. One of which indicates a door.

One indicates a... I should say door. Cabinets.

Cabinet doors, like they're not made for one. One of them has a symbol of a flower on it. The other has the symbol of a watering can.

And the final one has a symbol of a pair of shears, gardening shears. Now, they're not entirely recognizable. You probably wouldn't recognize them as such if you had not studied them beforehand, but Rana...

[Speaker 2]
They were like levers, did you say?

[Speaker 1]
Those are just three doors.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, doors of the voice box. Hmm.

[Speaker 1]
The second object of note is a machine that is composed of a number of different wires that kind of resembles this cabinet of notes. Recognize something of note. And it's emitting about three different pitches.

A C, an E, and an A. And then the final object of note is a smaller I inside of the receded I.

[Speaker 2]
Before we get into it, I would like to check for traps at the doors, and the wires.

[Speaker 7]
I would.

[Speaker 2]
Am I able to do that?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sure a 10 will reveal a whole lot.

[Speaker 1]
You are relatively confident that none of the arcane, indecipherable machinery in front of you is going to disintegrate your body. Sweet. Good about your odds there.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the door's locked. Does the door itself have the imagery of the flower, the watering can, and who she is on each one?

[Speaker 1]
Those cabinet doors? Yes. Each one has 10 images.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to check the one with the watering can.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. When you touch it, it lights up. If you touch it again, it shuts down again.

But there's no obvious handle. Anybody else looking to investigate?

[Speaker 4]
Puzzles.

[Speaker 2]
With the machine, the wires, are the wires themselves, are they being struck or plucked by something? Is that what's producing the sound? Looks like energy.

If I touch the other cabinet doors, do they do the same as the watering can door?

[Speaker 1]
They do. They light up differently. So the first one that you touched produced a soft, blue glow.

And which one did you touch next?

[Speaker 2]
The flower next.

[Speaker 1]
Flower? Also a soft glow.

[Speaker 2]
And the she is lost. Also a soft glow.

[Speaker 1]
Which resulted in all three of them opening. Sick. There is a compartment behind all three which is available to sort of crawl through before it opens up into a larger space.

[Speaker 2]
Would we like to go through the crawl space?

[Speaker 5]
Hell yeah. Probably, right? Monster skittering.

[Speaker 2]
Let's do it. We'll head on through and check out this next area through here.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, this one has the, is made an image of a simile of a brain. It, once again, has the structure of, again, a kind of like a system. Around, probably about a dozen total.

Thirty seconds remain. Finish them. Yes!

Three down. Okay, so the three main features of this room are halflings going across the floor itself. Once again, these are each one of the second layer of this brain way.

That had twelve total crystals. All of which are emitting stuff. Six of them appear to be red.

And then the final piece. Again, synapse. Computer architecture.

This computer architecture takes on a little bit more of like a pale teal color. How's your first night been yet? Each one of these has three puzzles by the way.

So it's like three opportunities to get around.

[Speaker 2]
There was twelve crystals, sorry, then six of them were red. Is that what you mean? That's correct.

And they were humming. Were they emitting a glow? I can't remember.

[Speaker 1]
These were not.

[Speaker 2]
Are they doing anything other than six of them being red?

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna go start touching shit. Anyone has a better idea?

[Speaker 5]
That's what I was gonna have Monk doing.

[Speaker 2]
Please do. It's your time to shine, Monk. Do what you do best.

[Speaker 5]
Sure. He's gonna go touch one. Actually, that's a lie.

He's touching all of them. Crystals. Yeah, that's what's there.

[Speaker 1]
There's the bottom set of rings.

[Speaker 2]
Each concentric circle. Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
I was just gonna say that the second floor is the one with the crystals and the third floor has synapses.

[Speaker 2]
With the bottom floor, are the spheres in each concentric circle? Is that what you said?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. There's two of them.

[Speaker 2]
How many concentric circles are there?

[Speaker 1]
A total of three. It looks like the spheres all have different symbols on them. For instance, the inner sphere has a watering can and a flower.

Sorry, the inner ring has a watering can and a flower. The outer ring has a flower and a pair of shears. And then the middle ring has a pair of shears and a watering can.

And let me put that in the chat.

[Speaker 2]
And how are the spheres organized in the circles? Are they opposite each other?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, each one is opposite to the inside.

[Speaker 2]
Can we move the spheres? Yes.

[Speaker 5]
I'll move them. Can I give it a gentle volleyball bump? Yeah, I'll rotate them.

I'll do the first one to the right, the second one a little bit to the left.

[Speaker 2]
We should try and get them to all line up so it's flower, watering can. Can we move the spheres between circles? Do the spheres move together?

If we push one, does it push its opposite in the same circle?

[Speaker 1]
It does push its opposite.

[Speaker 2]
So I assume we can rotate them around the circles, the only way we can move them, right? Is there anything to indicate where they should be?

[Speaker 1]
As Monk rotates them when the flower symbol matches up with the watering can symbol, they glow a song.

[Speaker 2]
Is that the outer flower linking up with the middle watering can?

[Speaker 1]
That's the inner and middle.

[Speaker 2]
And what if we get the outer spheres to line up with that?

[Speaker 1]
Then all three circle.

[Speaker 2]
That's good, right? Does it lock in place or anything like it's finished, or are we able to move it still?

[Speaker 1]
A glyph will show up in the middle ring that you'll assume.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
If you interact with it, it works. If you interact with it, you guys will...

[Speaker 2]
What was that? Sorry, I think I cut out.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, so if you interact with the glyph, you guys will be...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so we're done. Okay, good. Good.

[Speaker 1]
So you guys will actually begin progressing downwards throughout the neck. Again, you get the spine of this creature. It is composed of a number of different pyramid shapes lined vertically upwards.

You guys sink down into something that looks like the stomach. There are two windmills here. Do I describe them as waterwheels?

I'll describe them as waterwheels. Actually, that's probably a better idea. You see two waterwheels here that have, again, the same material.

They're composed of the same material as the forcefields you saw earlier. They have that teal blue. They're mostly transparent.

They have that grid structure. Only the... Let's see.

The fifth... Each one has six spokes. Each one has six spokes, but the fifth spoke on each of them does not have a paddle.

In the center of the room, there is a lever that can be turned either to the middle, the north, or to the south. And then on the ceiling of this room, there is three crystals. One has the...

And each of these crystals has the, again, the watery hemispheres and...

[Speaker 2]
Those symbols have been treating us well so far. I'll run a little closer and inspect the waterwheels. Can you please read it again?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so there's the waterwheels, which are... Again, they have spokes apiece on either side of this room. One of them has a paddle.

All of these spokes, except for the fifth one, has a paddle. These paddles have, like, aided work once they meet the gate, they sort of phase through. The second thing that's of note is the lever, which can be turned either to the center of the room, which cannot.

South, north, or position. Position. And then, of course, the final thing is the...

They don't have the order to them, but they do have the symbols of all.

[Speaker 5]
I'll move the lever to the north.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, when you move the lever to the north, one of them drops down the flower.

[Speaker 2]
Is monkey able to catch that? Or does it just hit the ground and smash? It will hover a few inches above the ground.

[Speaker 5]
Go to catch it. Does it stay in my hand?

[Speaker 1]
Sure does. In fact, it feels pretty easy to, in spite of its size, like, roughly your size, it looks pretty easy to, like, manipulate. And it feels pretty easy to manipulate.

[Speaker 5]
Spin it like a basketball?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, I spin it like a basketball. Look, guys.

[Speaker 2]
Impressive. How was the lever before monk touched it? Middle?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, what was that about the lever?

[Speaker 2]
How was it positioned before we touched it?

[Speaker 1]
It was positioned in the middle.

[Speaker 2]
And monk put it to the north. What if we try the south?

[Speaker 1]
If you twist it to the south, the flower crystal goes back up, and the sphere crystal...

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Fine.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. If I put it back to the middle, does the crystal go back up?

[Speaker 1]
The crystal goes back up, and this is one you're gonna have to experiment with.

[Speaker 6]
There we go, I think I made it. I just saw my connection going red. Hey, what's going on?

[Speaker 2]
Can we get Morgan to try and stop one of the paddle wheels to see what that does? Yeah. Is that like a check, or can I just do it?

[Speaker 3]
We're gonna break this thing. Probable Athletics? I will.

Click my funny athle... Wait, I'm a bear. I'm stronger.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I'm a bear for hours. Days, even. You can be a bear all night long.

Is there a way to change my proficiency bonus? What?

[Speaker 3]
The proficiency bonus isn't right. Yeah. Boom.

Whoops. Didn't add my proficiency. I'm fucking stupid!

No, wait, I did. There we go. Uh, 14.

Boom. Oh god, I did. No, I just rolled like an ass.

[Speaker 2]
Does Morgan get crushed?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, no. So, 14. Morgan tries to hold back the windmill, and he notices when he is trying to hold it back.

He's doing a pretty good job. He's kind of like sidling up. But it's still going down, and when the paddles press against one of his claws, the claw vanishes.

Where the paddle meets the floor, it just disintegrates the claw. Anything.

[Speaker 2]
Hmm. Okay, then. It's probably a bad suggestion.

Do we want to try putting one of the crystals in that?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, something I should ask is did you do the... Wait, nope. Never mind.

Never mind.

[Speaker 6]
I was about to ask which one. Fitting the puzzle.

[Speaker 2]
How tough do the crystals seem? How strong did the crystals seem when you held it?

[Speaker 1]
I'll say, they do seem pretty durable.

[Speaker 6]
Let's put it north again to the lever, and whoop. Which crystal did that give us? The...

I believe that gave you guys sheer. Wait, no. Sorry, that was a lie.

The fly... Or sorry, the flower comes down and...

[Speaker 2]
We got the shears down when it was in south position?

[Speaker 6]
Correct, and the flowers... The watering can hasn't come down when it's in the middle, right? Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
So anywhere the crystal fits in the waterwheel or... Sure. Like, is there a slot or anything that it can slide into, or can we just cram it between the ground and the wheel and hope it doesn't kill us all?

[Speaker 1]
More the latter, I guess.

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone have any better ideas than destroying the crystal?

[Speaker 3]
Not really? I don't know. Like, I don't have a better idea, but I don't like this one.

You know?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we can not do that just yet. Hey, Monk?

[Speaker 5]
Yes?

[Speaker 2]
Wanna hold on to the crystal as well as you can and go to the roof with it?

[Speaker 5]
You and I are on the same wavelength tonight because that's what I was thinking of doing.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yes. Okay, let's send Monk to the moon.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, you gotta hang on to the crystal.

[Speaker 2]
Is Monk able to go to the roof when we move the lever back? We'll set it to the middle. That is correct.

I'm up by the moon! How high is the roof?

[Speaker 1]
Only about ten feet up. It's about the most close from where we are.

[Speaker 2]
Is Monk able to free the watering can crystal? Monk, would you like to attempt to do this?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, can I grab it?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make PA strength or either make PA acrobatics or athletics. You can expend the key.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, cool. Spend all of it.

[Speaker 7]
It's not over. Your enemy is pushing for victory.

[Speaker 5]
What would spending the key do? Just give it a bonus? Yeah.

Would one key point equal one plus one?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Oh, sorry. I mean, roll it first and try.

Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Don't think spending key points will work.

[Speaker 7]
I should have done it.

[Speaker 1]
For no apparent reason. Okay, so are you getting adjustments?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think spending key points would get me there unless it's a DC 10.

[Speaker 1]
I rolled an 8.

[Speaker 5]
He, like, cat falls. He looks dumb when he falls, but he lands on his feet. I wasn't strong enough or it's not going to work.

You just weren't strong enough. I wasn't strong enough.

[Speaker 1]
There's probably too much force in, like, moving yourself as opposed to moving the, um... Too much force moving yourself as opposed to pushing yourself off the ceiling.

[Speaker 5]
He looks at Morgan and he's like, you should try it!

[Speaker 2]
The ceiling's not too high for the crystals, is it? Nope, just the floor. If we stand on Morgan...

[Speaker 3]
Like, Morgan's tall enough. He's a huge creature.

[Speaker 5]
Can you just, like, stand on your hind feet and, like, bat it down? Yeah, just bat it down.

[Speaker 3]
Do you understand us as a bear? Absolutely! It's still me.

So, unlike Polymorph, I keep my mental stats and my proficiencies. So, all of my wild shapes are... Like, I've got...

They're all as intelligent as Morgan. As Morgan. Which isn't very intelligent.

[Speaker 5]
But, um... Hold on, I'll give you an example. It understands just patting something down out of the air.

[Speaker 3]
It's going in voiceover flow, but this is what my Morgan looks like. Where's voiceover flow? There it is.

So, I've got my summons and my wild shapes and then me down the bottom. But all of the wild shapes are done up with what stats I would have as them. Like, they're edited to the point where they are done as their me.

Well, the summons are obviously, like... A black bear summon has 2 int. But if I turned into a black bear, I would have 8.

[Speaker 2]
I'll get pulling, bear boy.

[Speaker 3]
I just can't speak. Unless you speak, bear. Alright, what check would you like, James?

[Speaker 1]
So, if you're attempting to yank this delightful crystal out of its perch, I would like an athletics from the fair.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. I'm gonna rage and do it. Because that'll give me advantage.

The rage will drop right after, so I'll just mark that off in a second. There we go. Beautiful.

Wonderful. Alright. I'm gonna mark off my rage.

And... My rage ends at next turn, because I don't take damage or make an attack.

[Speaker 5]
It hit you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, unless it hits me and then I've got another round. 28.

[Speaker 1]
That seems pretty fucking good, as far as I'm concerned. Now, which crystal did you yank off?

[Speaker 3]
Which crystal did you ask Morgan to yank? The watering can. The watering can?

Yeah, I thought so.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the watering can comes off.

[Speaker 3]
Cool. Well, I'm just holding it, like we are done with this.

[Speaker 2]
Now, what happens if we move the lever north?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the flower drops down.

[Speaker 2]
And the one we have is still with us?

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 5]
Grab that other one. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not gonna rage for this one.

[Speaker 5]
Heh, no need.

[Speaker 2]
But now you're pulling down the shields.

[Speaker 3]
Yep. This is the equivalent of, like, Morgan saying, yes, I have a pair of lockpicks and then pulling out a hammer.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
Just beating in all like a buzzsaw and just, like, saws around the lock and then just pushes the door open.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so what are you guys experimenting?

[Speaker 2]
Are we able to get all three crystals if Morgan pulls down the shields? I just gotta make one more. Well, the lever dropped down the flower for us.

Oh, true, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do we have all three crystals now? No, the shears are still at the top.

[Speaker 3]
Is Morgan able to pull that one down as well?

[Speaker 2]
With a 27. Fuck, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
You only have two to work with. Well, we need the watering can back, I think, because the order is water and can, flower, shears. I see.

Maybe we need to touch that.

[Speaker 1]
What was the order in the last puzzle? The order in the last puzzle was, well, there were technically two orders. Watering can, flower, and shears.

Uh, second.

[Speaker 2]
Giving flower, water, and can. Flower, shears, water, and can? Yeah, I thought so.

Well, we have both of those. Let's just tap them together, see what happens. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It seemed like tapping the crystals did. However, you do have access to knowledge checks.

[Speaker 3]
Bold of you to assume any mental stat is. I have survival. I would like to use...

Oh wait, no, I do have nature. But I doubt that is good. Um, but, Zianna has Arcana.

[Speaker 2]
Please, Zianna. What twist, what... XD.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no.

[Speaker 1]
Zianna does... Zianna doesn't have that.

[Speaker 3]
Easy. Uh, Zianna does have to head home, so she is about to leave my place, but I'm good to play Zianna's character. For this last bit of the session.

And she has to get home at a certain time today, so she is heading off.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Zianna, thanks for playing with us. Nice seeing you again.

[Speaker 3]
You hear that?

[Speaker 2]
Nice for playing. Good to see you again. I would like to also do an Arcana check.

[Speaker 5]
XD.

[Speaker 2]
Beautiful. XD.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 5]
We know who's sharing the one brain cell tonight.

[Speaker 1]
A lot of myths about the... I should say a lot of... A lot of myths about the entrance to the deep center around sort of a fall from...

Not necessarily a fall from, but it's a fall from this uh... this uh... center.

kill for it. Garden out of time until eventually this end. Decided to begin destroying things, and the garden which was initially supposed to be like out of control came and which was supposed to be out of control started becoming like really, really annoying and tidy by and large.

Only wild for it. Untamed area. As a final note, I'll say that the entrance to the deep's programming or pattern as it's referred to in most of the most of the most of the lingo and most of the sentence tend to make use of the word reversal.

[Speaker 2]
So we try doing it in reverse then? But what do we do with the crystals? Well we have the shears and we have the flower.

[Speaker 3]
Is there any way to get... yeah but is there any way to get the other one in reverse as well?

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean, sorry?

[Speaker 3]
The other solution to the puzzle can we reverse that one? Um Flower shears water in can? Can we get water in can shears flower somehow?

[Speaker 2]
Um flower went back to the roof so we have so if we put the lever north again it should we should have water in can still and we'll have... alright fuck yeah um hmm hmm How do we reverse? How do we reverse the wheels?

Surely that's just the solution.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah How do you reverse the wheels? Um Of course it doesn't really seem like you've done anything that could Is there anything we've missed?

[Speaker 2]
Can I do like an investigation check? But anybody

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna give her anybody else Please do

[Speaker 3]
I mentioned I have proficiency It's not very good because I have minus one int but I'm happy to try

[Speaker 4]
There it is

[Speaker 3]
Yeah this is very

[Speaker 4]
int and I am not int

[Speaker 3]
Yeah I'm dumb as hell

[Speaker 5]
I can try, I don't know

[Speaker 3]
I was telling this story yesterday to someone how I made potato soup Incredible stuff I was told the steps to make mashed potato and they never explicitly told me that after I'd done boiling the potato chunks to take most of the water out before you mash it so I just didn't think and just took the masher to it and was like this definitely looks wrong I had to fucking do it all over again Jesus I'm dumb as hell Did not let this man cook

[Speaker 1]
13 it kinda looks like these as you're looking it looks like each one of these is made of some type of fruit and something you're pretty familiar with only because you're a druid people really love that I think people love

[Speaker 5]
Break em

[Speaker 3]
What if we break them in the right order then What if we break water, I would assume water in can shears flour Well we break one of them open to start with anyway Let's break water in can

[Speaker 2]
Okay So if we We have water in can because we pulled that down from the roof

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to just take my hammer to it I don't have a hammer, I'm a bear Um Can I strike it with one of the giant fists

[Speaker 4]
Are we going to put it in the paddle and see if it broke it Oh yeah the paddle breaks

[Speaker 3]
Yeah Thank you

[Speaker 4]
But doesn't the paddle like destroy everything Oh It Well it only it touched your claw and destroyed it but not your whole self so maybe Maybe if we're quick it'll shatter the

[Speaker 2]
can by yeah

[Speaker 4]
Well let's try breaking

[Speaker 3]
it ourselves first and if we can't break it then it's probably the paddle

[Speaker 5]
We have my gun

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone have a blunt weapon

[Speaker 4]
to slap this bitch

[Speaker 3]
I have a hammer on the other side of my

[Speaker 4]
I actually do have a mace I just don't use it We do have a mace give it to the bear

[Speaker 3]
Give the bear a mace Why do you think it's called a bear mace They're all d20 plus 5 9 A 20 to hit the amber with a mace A mace is a d6 Fucking 6 bludgeoning god damn it Does it crack Does it seem like it could be damaged by our mortal weapons Mortal weapons

[Speaker 4]
It is cold iron I don't know if that helps

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna pass you back your mace Do we want me to unwild shape and try the hammer or are we just using the paddle Let's just do the paddle I think we use the paddle too

[Speaker 5]
Don't waste a wild shape

[Speaker 2]
James is like these idiots were onto it like half an hour ago when they made that side check That's my favourite part of all puzzles is when you second guess yourself

[Speaker 3]
Crack open the most important DM 5e supplement puzzles for toddlers

[Speaker 2]
It goes in the square Brain exercises for under 4 year olds

[Speaker 3]
That's right the square hole What about this semi circle That's right the square hole Psychological damage every time I do that video

[Speaker 1]
Which crystal do you put into the paddle Watering

[Speaker 2]
Watering can Ok Do you put in the left side paddles or the right side paddles Are they spinning the same direction

[Speaker 1]
Nope

[Speaker 2]
One's going south one's going north Hmm

[Speaker 5]
This one was the middle one

[Speaker 2]
Watering can we didn't use the lever to pull down Yeah But we can get it back up like if we

[Speaker 3]
just move one of the other levers then it goes back up like it just leaves

[Speaker 2]
I don't think the watering can has done that That's probably fine I don't think we should have the watering can first now I'm getting scared

[Speaker 3]
The other order was what Watering can flower shears so we can do shears first then

[Speaker 1]
You guys can experiment here

[Speaker 2]
Let's do shears first then We'll just do shears

[Speaker 3]
We'll do shears because that's also how we solved the top puzzle as well In case it remembers what our answer was for the first one Right

[Speaker 2]
We'll put the lever south and we'll break the we'll use the left paddle Oh The left one

[Speaker 5]
I thought that one was just a flip I'm putting the lever to the left I'm grabbing whatever one this north whatever north one and I'm putting it in the north paddles

[Speaker 1]
Oh the paddles are left or right Grabbing

[Speaker 3]
It's fine we're breaking we're breaking shears Okay here we go In the same direction

[Speaker 5]
of the paddles Whatever

[Speaker 1]
The direction of the paddles is weird But if you put it in the left side paddles it comes out on the right glowing red

[Speaker 2]
Red was a good last puzzle

[Speaker 5]
Red was good

[Speaker 2]
Does Does it do a full circle of the one it comes out on?

No so it goes it disintegrates on the left and comes out the right And there was nothing in the amber right?

[Speaker 3]
It just broke it?

[Speaker 2]
Uh correct Cool Those shears What next watering can or flower?

[Speaker 1]
Uh flower Let's do the same with flower then Flower comes out Wrong Blue was good in the first puzzle Let's just do um watering can Let's complete the sequence Let's just do watering can and see what happens Sure thing Watering can is glowing Do we want to try shears again?

[Speaker 2]
Wait shears is gone All the crystals destroyed? No They're on the other wheel Can we get So shears is red Can we feed it through again? We feed it to the other side maybe Oh Sick We still have our progress I'm in the blue now Yeah Can we take all the crystals off the wheel?

They stay blue Yep I assume you guys are good Um Well What did we put in second? Shears If we put shears through again does it go red? It goes blue Oh sorry If you guys already did that Yes Have we finished the It's still blue?

Oh sorry No it goes And then what did we put through second last time?

[Speaker 4]
Flower So we'll try watering can now Second I'm so glad you're paying attention I didn't remember at all I am That's the only thing I paid attention to Blue again Did we get progress when it was red or blue?

[Speaker 2]
One of them was red I think it was the shears And then the other two were blue We made shears blue by putting it in after the flower Yeah Looks like you gotta make a decision here Can we just try a recombination of feeding the crystals to the roof?

[Speaker 5]
You gotta press that celestial You gotta press that roof Oh we just We're done Okay We solved this puzzle So are you Let me ask you this way You have a combination that's blue and you have a combination that's red Blue pill or red pill Okay Blue We're going blue We're going blue We're taking Xanax maybe Everybody say blue?

[Speaker 1]
Blue Take us to a more forgiving puzzle This puzzle's forgiving Take us to an easier puzzle That was pretty simple All of the amber pieces at this point shatter and again out of this grid technology produce a rather beautiful gold bound book that seems to radiate health and vitality Can I please look at the book?

[Speaker 2]
Monk grabs it like oh cool my book and I'm just kidding I'm just kidding She's about to pass out Laughter It is It is in fact the book of Exalted Deeds Yeah That's it Should we leave?

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to ask the alchemist who has been here not helping Yeah He's been there face palming We should hide here a little earlier actually Can we get my tummy egg first? Okay Yeah What was that last one?

[Speaker 2]
Can we teleport out?

[Speaker 1]
Uh yes Red card takes everyone back Getting spat back Oh We return to uh wherever her has deigned or deigned and have one book of Exalted Deeds Here is your payment Rana hands each of you a rebate Laughter Will you get paid for this?

[Speaker 5]
Laughter Huh Monk starts to bite the ruby Everyone gets 100 gold.

[Speaker 3]
There we go Done That I could do something with Laughter Sierra told me it would be a cool place to nap on the drake Now I was here Alright well Um Um Alright well Congratulations folks You're going to 4000 Yes Oh Zeana is really close actually And I think Morgan's creeping steadily towards it too What level is Morgan? Morgan is level 11 but he is 98000 XP of 100,000 Ooh So 2000 XP and Morgan is level 12 which I don't know slash don't believe anyone's higher But I don't know. If anyone's higher it'd be Pera right?

Pera yeah I was like the only person who I believed would be higher is Pera

[Speaker 4]
I am 4000 away from my next level up as well

[Speaker 1]
Pera's been fucking killed in the beginning Laughter You ground out all those cleric levels Alright finally The big thing is

[Speaker 3]
The next level's a enormous power spike because it gives Morgan level 3 challenge rating beasts Oh Which I don't think any of them are bears but they are good Oh my goodness It's, listen I'm sure I could work something I'm sure I could work something out with my gracious DM to flavor Hold up, what are the challenge ratings for you things? Great white shark These are such unbelievably not bear creatures I very much believe

[Speaker 4]
I mean if it's a great white shark you could just be a shark bear There's an ankylosaurus

[Speaker 3]
Sabretooth tiger Whatever a bristled moorbounder is Giant lightning eel Giant scorpion Giant snapping turtle Killer whale spotted lion

[Speaker 2]
and young horizonback tortoise

[Speaker 4]
What the fuck is this thing's face though

[Speaker 3]
This is your moorbounder What is that I see a picture of it, what the fuck It looks like a cat

[Speaker 2]
James it's time I can now cast legend lore It's time I was half expecting somebody to cast that in this section

[Speaker 1]
Nobody's cast that in the cafe yet

[Speaker 2]
Well That's going to be my first downtime thing before I read the book I would like to cast legend lore on it and I also would like to figure out a way to track it across the multiverse so we I don't get I don't know what happens if I don't

[Speaker 4]
know my end of the deal

[Speaker 3]
Probably I would assume nothing great Yeah

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to bed Goodnight Thanks for playing

[Speaker 2]
See ya

[Speaker 1]
That did, that did go

[Speaker 2]
That's the first time we've given out this one Sweet, mine now

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah Make sure you do write out the downtime action

[Speaker 2]
I will, I will write that out properly I assume legend lore is not a downtime action but the rest of it will be a downtime action

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it'll be like you consulting your in conjunction Cool

[Speaker 2]
So hard to destroy this bush

[Speaker 3]
I think the only threes that are worth using are the two that I've already got Wait Where's that Armoured Sabretooth Tiger It's wearing half plate Am I allowed to use that? It's So there's a cut I didn't actually realize

[Speaker 3]
Let's see, what else do I remember? I think there were goblins around this area, but I can't remember clearly. Once again, notes of it somewhere, but might have misplaced them.

Okay, yes, I have looked through my screenshots as well. I do not have any on where the items were thrown.

[Speaker 2]
And you guys hear me all right.

[Speaker 3]
Hello, James! I don't know if you caught that last bit, but it seems the notes I made for where people's things were thrown have taken a wonk, so that's nice.

[Speaker 2]
No, that's okay. Like, I have the original world saved. Thank God.

Otter took a bunch of screenshots as well.

[Speaker 3]
That is fantastic news. I do not have to worry about it anymore. I had been like, oh no, it seems the notes are gone.

That's fun. How are you doing this week?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm okay. My medication was delayed again. I'm gonna have to get some blood work.

So I'm waiting to get, I'm not gonna get it today for a variety of reasons. Probably gonna, I might try to get it tomorrow morning or maybe the day after, I'm not sure. But I'll be able to get my ADHD meds after that.

So in the meantime, what I'm doing is some self-medicating with alcohol to keep the constant stream of voices and thoughts a little bit quieter than they usually are.

[Speaker 5]
That's the best standby medication ever.

[Speaker 2]
You gotta love it. You gotta love it.

[Speaker 1]
They do plenty of things and blow you fleshy things to keep you occupied.

[Speaker 11]
What fleshy things to keep you occupied? What was that about your mom?

[Speaker 2]
I was like, oh, there's some innuendo there. And then this is what happens is the second part.

[Speaker 1]
No, I was gonna do just, I was gonna do like some flashy things, like some of the animations, maybe like flick some lights on and off.

[Speaker 4]
These are flashing.

[Speaker 5]
I don't know if I'm flashing anybody.

[Speaker 1]
I'll expand the doors open and shut really quick, so it doesn't look that strobe-like effect. Just so you're not epileptic. Like, oh, look at the shiny lights.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, check this out.

[Speaker 4]
They're calling me.

[Speaker 1]
All right, perfect, so I believe everyone's here. What would you like to do? There is a session in the quest board, or you can do like some adventuring.

Uh-oh.

[Speaker 2]
The heart does that about twice a session. It will be fine. She'll be there.

[Speaker 5]
That's what we got in the quest board.

[Speaker 1]
I just made a heartfelt apology to Heart to make her feel bad. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to joke about the flashy lights. Please come back.

[Speaker 6]
Wait, what happened to Heart?

[Speaker 1]
Because Heart disconnected. I need to do a heartfelt apology before they come back. I'm sorry, please come back.

I'm waiting for the flashy lights.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I only have TIG available because Meek is playing in Candyland.

[Speaker 2]
Meek is presently in Candyland, depending on where this session takes place. So I did hear some questions about like where sessions are.

[Speaker 3]
I heard you were self-medicating with alcohol. How does that work? You drink alcohol.

Okay, don't die, and best of luck with getting your medication.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you, thank you. No, it's just easier method of relaxing, focusing, and stuff like that, kind of, but in the opposite direction to where I no longer have the train of screaming voices inside my head. So there's a little bit easier to focus on just one, but because it's more difficult to focus on, more difficult to even acknowledge more than one to begin with.

So I have a nice little render going in the background. I have some timers set for me to do things today. And then, of course, I will be, by the time I go into work tomorrow or tonight, I will be, well, fresh.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, good luck.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if you're going to work with a nice buzz. That's going to be nice and fresh work.

[Speaker 2]
Man, I metabolize it so quickly. It's so stupid. It doesn't take much to actually get me going, but I metabolize and it fades really, really quickly.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, so you have like a shark liver.

[Speaker 2]
I have like a, did you say a shark liver?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, a shark's like core of his body mass is nothing but his liver, so it's hard to poison her.

[Speaker 2]
Interesting, interesting. I've never given a shark beer, a twisted tea. We should try that.

If the Americans can fund a study to test whether peacocks are more sexually active under the effects of cocaine, we can give sharks twisted tea, and I'm sure that it would be cheaper. We spent a lot of money on that. It was like, well, according to Rand Paul, the phrase, his exact phrase was, I believe that we can stipulate, yes.

But we spent the $15,000 anyway. No doubt a significant portion of that money was dedicated to resupplying. Yeah, these peacocks went through the cocaine pretty quickly.

[Speaker 5]
Getting a shark drunk would be cheap research. Just give them to a fraternity for a few weeks. They'll do it all for you for free.

[Speaker 2]
No, we don't need to do it cheaply. I also heard a couple of questions about the map, which is currently undergoing something of a major revision in the background and might well finish during this section itself. Were there any questions about the map?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no. I was just pointing out where I thought things were beforehand, because I do remember the vague area of some locations, but not exactly where they were. So I was just like, well, there was a village here, the evil space crabs up there.

[Speaker 5]
Crab people.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, they're like... Some of the crabs knew of the spaceship. It's right next to the hidden block.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 2]
On the Isle of Dread.

[Speaker 1]
Or with the spaceship that we can get a Starfinder II items from?

[Speaker 2]
So if you want to play a Starfinder II session, it's going to be up towards the top right. What exactly did they give me? It was towards Broadbark Fool, which is towards the top right.

There's an Arctic mountain range that's very close to the spires at the north end of the valley, which are represented by that kind of like a starlight kind of hexes. And there's actually several different communities that are kind of nestled in that area. So there's a grove of fire druids, wildfire druids.

There is a necromancer's college. There is a town of ogres, ogre farmers, who cultivates and tend to coral. And quite close to that area was a...

There's a whole separate plot line about resident seeds, which were like this leftover technology that... I could explain this to you guys. The valley itself used to be floating over a thousand years ago.

It was quite literally floating in the air once they discovered some basically dunamancy in critical world terms. And they had a lot of machines set up to keep it afloat until one day it was no longer afloat and it came crashing down. The valley did, which had previously been raised rather high up, came crashing down.

The entire valley did not all come crashing down equally, of course, but this dealt a lot of damage to the people living there, the underdark as well. Which was actually doing quite good in this region until that happened. And so some of those seeds are still around.

And there are remnants of those seeds that point to a city in the top, again, in the top right. So there's like this little cluster of activity over by the Arctic Mountain Range. Now that's finished.

Oh, there's a question about goblins as well. They live to the left of that red section on the map on the left. The left-hand side of the left of those Red Mountains primarily.

[Speaker 1]
How big is each hex?

[Speaker 2]
Each hex is approximately 24 miles, putting the length of this map at roughly the size of Argentina. It's 100 hexes high by 50 hexes wide.

[Speaker 8]
Argentina or Chile?

[Speaker 5]
How about Rhode Island?

[Speaker 2]
Rhode Island probably would occupy like two or three hexes. How long is Rhode Island?

[Speaker 5]
I just know it's a small state.

[Speaker 2]
Width, 37 miles. So it would be one hex. Oh, wait, north to south is 48 miles.

So it would be two hexes high and a hex and a half wide.

[Speaker 3]
Wow, a whole half. Woohoo!

[Speaker 5]
And that's where all the stubs are built. Weird. So I need to go back in the sewer for anything or is that one done?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, should be done.

[Speaker 4]
Huzzah. I mean, you always need to go back in the sewers.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, someone got a pet alligator out of it.

[Speaker 4]
I got a pet alligator out of it. It was great.

[Speaker 5]
And in about a month or so, it'll be bigger than your character.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, yes, much fun. So, Ver, are we picking from the quest board again?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, quest board or just some random adventuring.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, let's see what's on the quest board. So I believe there is helping a gentleman who is seeking some assistance with some funding. I think that one is a ship.

And something about swimming underwater. So if you have a water character, Alas, the cat hasn't unlocked swimming yet, but soon. I believe there is also a magical item that'll help me out with that.

It's one of the items you can do underwater braiding. It's nice. We can do the money guy first.

[Speaker 3]
And yes, and my level two character is available for that one.

[Speaker 4]
That's good. Perfect. If you would like to chuck your character in the party.

Okey-doke. Yay, taken to all the negotiations with his minus one charisma. It's funny because when James takes a drink, it blurs his can.

[Speaker 1]
So it looked like he's like not trying to sponsor things.

[Speaker 2]
Nobody can know I'm just picking Twisted Bean.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we got a one, two, and three. It's nice, it's in order. No, the level that's not nice.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, James. Yeah, that's why I put the warning beforehand. Because Nessie specifically said a while back that she doesn't.

She's not into that sort of stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Which is totally, totally understandable. I was about to, I was about to think. Because now, once you guys have gotten to the place, I, you can kind of like shuffle those things off to the side.

Like, you know, any, any kids that have been. I can make mention of kids speaking of that. But not really engaging with it.

I was going to use, make it save.

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't seem, is this for the first session? Because it doesn't seem like Nessie's. Oh, it's for the second.

[Speaker 2]
It's for the second one. Which is, which is totally fine. Because it's mostly dealing with the dungeon.

And not dealing with the town itself or any of its inhabitants. But the important thing right now is which one we are doing. So let's go down to the quest board.

[Speaker 3]
We are helping a guy with his money problems.

[Speaker 2]
Is that Wishful Bones? Yep. Excellent.

Excellent. Well, as usual, I will bring the cannon.

[Speaker 3]
Huzzah.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, Alice put in an adventure. It's an adventure to go explore the world.

[Speaker 4]
I'm bringing Levent. Levent? Levent!

The sailor cat. The kitty cat? Yes.

[Speaker 5]
That character looks very abstract. If you'd like to introduce yourselves.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. The cannon, you want to go first?

[Speaker 8]
I'm a cannon. Large, about six foot something. Six foot five.

Clearbow.

[Speaker 2]
Haven't been transferred or transformed into something of a... What the fuck is that? Now I'm manifesting as something of a Yalgoi myself.

I carry a book around with me and a shap. And I'm very interested in investigations. I also have a lot of markings and badges indicating some presence or some place within the hierarchy of Druids in this valley.

[Speaker 3]
Nice, nice. All right, we shall go next. This here is Levent.

They're a catfolk sailor type thing. One would call a privateer. They would...

They avoid the fact that technically that's a legalized criminal, but they're very proud of their work and will happily hand you a business card so you can hire them for anything you may want to do. They're the Calico catfolk. They're about five, seven, so shorter than the both of you.

And they're wearing what you'd probably see around the region of Turkish sailors. So they're having a fantastic time. So mostly you're just...

[Speaker 2]
So did you say Turkish sailors? Are you finding the Ottomans?

[Speaker 3]
Their original outfit and stuff was based on Ottoman sailors. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, based on Ottoman sailors. All right, so you were being targeted by the Pukulga.

[Speaker 10]
Who?

[Speaker 2]
The first rotary machine gun meant to convince the Ottomans of the benefits of Christian civilization. We have made it into this world via Dr. Silver, one of my only IRL campaigns in this world. I see.

Very complicated.

[Speaker 5]
And the Pukulga has two types of ammunition.

[Speaker 2]
It does. The circles and the squares.

[Speaker 3]
And the square bullets.

[Speaker 1]
I love it. Perfect. And Tig?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yes. Tig is a huge centaur. About eight foot nine.

Really big, heavy, built like a brick house. A former pro athlete. Didn't retire by choice.

Now he pretty much travels around trying to excite others in sports and stuff like that while trying to make the area safe for mainly children to, you know, enjoy life. That's why he could still do things like crafting and stuff like that where he can maintain things, especially his gear.

[Speaker 4]
What kind of pro sports did you used to do? Water polo. Well, Tracy, didn't know you were so good at riding horses.

No water polo. No, I made an imaginary sport called blitz ball.

[Speaker 5]
I try to describe it as like the most violent, it's like take rugby and like amplify it by like a thousand for injuring people actually get you points.

[Speaker 4]
I see. So I'm still trying to work on his voice and his mannerisms.

[Speaker 3]
No problem. Same with Levent here. I haven't quite.

[Speaker 4]
I haven't quite solidified that either. Yar! Shiver me something.

Shiver me timbers. As you go about your day. Oh, sorry.

Go ahead. No, you're fine. I was making a joke.

Do your little quip.

[Speaker 1]
As you go about your day, you know, you've heard rumors from different people. I don't believe there's a unified organization for quests yet. So you've heard from different friends, people, that there's some people seeking help outside of the guards.

And so we've all joined up to meet him and inquire about the guy.

[Speaker 4]
And I believe...

[Speaker 1]
I've not given a picture. Um, you see the man. He's, you know, kind of looking pretty frantic.

He's skitterish. He's not looking too well. He's got scratch marks on his arms where he's, like, nervously scratching his arm.

And he's like, oh, it's easy coming up to see him. It's like, oh, hey, any chance that you can help me out? I'm a bit of a blind.

And he's, like, scratching his arm a bit. It's like, oh, I need some help. No one else will help me, please.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to open an investigation. Pursuing a lead into what this man...

[Speaker 4]
What is binding this man? It looks like he's... Oh, that's not yours.

Yep, your whole...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, no, it's literally like, pursue a lead, investigator. Nonsense.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so he looks like he is extremely nervous. Give us a kind of... Give us a roll for what kind of check that you got for information.

So depending on what you roll... I need someone to aid you. I do.

Perfect. Give us the record knowledge check, please.

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Do you think he's an upstanding citizen? And he's just very, very nervous at the moment.

You know, you can see the signs of fatigue on his face. You know, that sometimes when people get really stressed, when animals get stressed, they get nervous, you know, they call self-harm. You've heard, you think this is a perfect example of this.

You know, an upstanding citizen under duress, he's concerned, he's out of shape, you know, he's struggling to stand still. And just like a nervous tick has caused him to scratch marks on his arms. He's like, if you don't help me out, I don't know what's going to happen.

Mmm.

[Speaker 3]
Why do you need this money so bad, mister? Does that vague hand signal to indicate looking for a name?

[Speaker 1]
Name's Jeffrey. You know, I had bad luck. I ran into some bad people.

And I'm not gonna lie, I dug myself in a hole and I don't know how to dig myself out. So he's looking a little bit nervous about what to say. Can you try to soothe him?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, I will attempt. If you're like, there, there, just tell us what we need to do and we'll do our best. This would, what do I want for this?

Diplomacy?

[Speaker 1]
No, whatever you'd roll, it'll be in relation to that roll as a response. So how do you handle it?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Oh, give me a second.

[Speaker 5]
The diplomacy is not strong with this one.

[Speaker 3]
Give me a second. I did it. I did it with a hero point.

It was so bad.

[Speaker 1]
This is bad. Jesus.

[Speaker 3]
You see, that's why I did it with the hero point.

[Speaker 1]
He hushes up to you, he gets real close. And you can, when you get closer to him, he definitely has a stench about him that he hasn't showered in a couple of days. You notice as you get closer, his clothes are sweaty and quite dirty now.

And he goes, I borrowed a little bit of a debt from, this seems hesitant to say anything, but it's like, oh, this is one of the local loan sharks in the area. And I thought I had the money to pay it, but I lost my job. And I just don't know what to do.

I was thinking about, I know one of the places he has, and there's plenty of money there. I mean, they're not exactly legal and we could probably rob them and I'll split you the money with it. You know, or if you can find another way to help me out, you know, I'll be in your favor, you know, and I'll help you out whenever I can.

And I'll do anything in my powers to help you out in the future if you ever need me.

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 8]
Fairly reasonable gentleman, I must say.

[Speaker 4]
Mm hmm.

[Speaker 3]
I will, I will lean into everyone else. I love it. We'll lean into everyone else and say, well, considering the amount of debt he has, I don't think he can afford to go into ours.

And then just won't say that to him. But we'll just lead it lean in and somewhat stageless for that. Okay.

Rubbery it is. Mr. Jeffrey, sir.

[Speaker 1]
Because I normally like this. Normally, you know, I'm pretty good with my hands. I'm great at crafting things.

So if you ever need anything made, I can, you know, help make some stuff for you. You know, it's just that it just takes time to make money and I just don't have that time.

[Speaker 3]
Mm hmm. Okey dokey.

[Speaker 4]
I'll get you to place yourself. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on. Where are we placing results? Thank you.

Oh, we're there.

[Speaker 5]
Keeps using the wrong token.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that was my character. Kept doing it. Wonder if it still does it.

[Speaker 4]
No. Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. So everyone should be able to see that. It should be in a tan square.

[Speaker 3]
Mm hmm. Oh, um, Mr. Nibble, don't forget to make your character sleep so he's no longer injured.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. Same with McCannon. If you need to do your rest and preparations.

You are injured.

[Speaker 8]
I sure do.

[Speaker 2]
That reminds me. We need to add a log in on the GM account. Change the date to the 24th.

And a note. What's the gentleman's name that we're assisting Jeffrey said Jeffrey Welling. There we go.

[Speaker 5]
Well then type five six issues that with the ears up or down.

[Speaker 3]
Okey dokey. Is Mr. Jeffrey following us or did he just point us in the general direction.

[Speaker 1]
He will be there as soon as I remember.

[Speaker 4]
I like that you named them. That's nice. I like the not great Robert.

The not great.

[Speaker 2]
The anti suspicious.

[Speaker 1]
Jeffrey is there.

[Speaker 5]
It's like taking a legal name of. I'm not a criminal.

[Speaker 6]
You're on. You're on.

[Speaker 5]
Staying in the court.

[Speaker 6]
Right. Come on now.

[Speaker 1]
So it's not one of the nicest places in town. There is a few guards posted around. There's a couple of merchants doing their daily trades.

You know, there's a temple here. A little bit of like a background. Park.

Small merchant places. All around. He says he needs about 50 gold to pay off his debt.

And he used his tools as a deposit because they're quite valuable. And he's unable to perform his craft values tools.

[Speaker 3]
I see.

[Speaker 5]
That's okay. I couldn't afford to run out of gold.

[Speaker 1]
And that's what kind of really drew him to this point. You know, he, he thought he'd be able to have the money by then. Something's occurred that you haven't arrived out of him.

Just something events occurred. And. So without his tools, he's kind of been in a big bind.

So if you have the money. So he's seeking some assistance. He needs about 50 gold to pay off his debt, gets his tools back.

And he'll be fine after that. But you should be in the market. He advises of a place up here.

Which is. The loan sharks base of business. So it's one of the local taverns.

It's pretty popular. It's pretty seedy. They have them in the back rooms.

It's not going to be great just to barge in there. You know, and just read the place.

[Speaker 4]
You need to be smart about it. All right.

[Speaker 9]
We could try sneaking around. Can we try sneaking around the back?

[Speaker 2]
Well, if we could have some dirt from the local guards. See if they have any kind of vulnerabilities, you know.

[Speaker 3]
Excellent point, Mr. McCannon.

[Speaker 10]
I second the idea.

[Speaker 2]
If anything is not my. Any kind of. Similar debts.

Might be a favor to somebody outside the city.

[Speaker 4]
Are we talking to this guy?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. As you approach the guy. He's a little funny badge.

Henry on him. You know, as you notice Lee, as he's around him.

[Speaker 3]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
You know, some of the other guys start paying attention to. Greetings citizens. How can I help you today?

It's a fine day. Is it not?

[Speaker 3]
That it is.

[Speaker 1]
And so how can I help you? There's plenty of stalls around. If you need some instructions.

Or guide a way to find things.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
I can also give you a general direction.

[Speaker 2]
We were looking to speak with some of the guards specifically. We were given information that some of them have either run into financial trouble or have. I've been exposed to some other vulnerabilities, something that would.

So they could expose them to the potential. Blackmail debt or something similar. And so as an investigator, I wanted to come in.

See if I could close that loop and restore security to this particular place. You wouldn't happen to know anybody who's been having either financial difficulties or some kind of. Social safe.

Maybe engaged or accused of some social taboo.

[Speaker 1]
You notice when you mentioned things that are the financial difficulties of God and blackmail content. He does not appear happy. His face visibly tightens.

Yes. Well, we're not. Might be paid the most.

Most of the scarves here are pretty loyal. I don't think you'd find anyone really with too much to worry about, especially nothing with being a blackmailer.

[Speaker 2]
That's strange. Oh, that, that worries me greatly. Do you think that somebody might have said this on this trail to.

For nefarious purposes, then.

[Speaker 1]
It looks around. It's like, I don't know. I haven't got the slightest idea what trail you're on.

[Speaker 2]
So somebody else said to us on the trail of. Potentially being blackmailed or having some kind of financial. You know, financial incentive to expose their security.

And so if somebody was lying about that. And that's, that's worrisome to me is, you know, it's law enforcement.

[Speaker 1]
If you have any concerns about the quality of God, you know, you can speak to the captain.

[Speaker 2]
Speak to the captain. You seem like a fine God. It seems like there's not any problems with the guards.

Then it seems like somebody's lying to us about them. We better figure out why.

[Speaker 1]
There's always some salacious rumors about God. It's hard to believe what's true or not. But if there was any real problems, you know, people wouldn't just sit by and not say anything about it.

Would they?

[Speaker 2]
I see. I see. I think I agree with you, sir.

Where can we find this captain?

[Speaker 1]
Captain's normally at the guardhouse.

[Speaker 2]
At the guardhouse. You've been, you've been wonderful, sir. What's your, what's your name?

[Speaker 1]
Point to his name badge. Henry.

[Speaker 2]
Henry. Put in a good word for you. Thank you.

Thank you for your assistance. Oh, fuck. I rolled a one.

Oh, that's rough. Only just. I love it.

Somebody else take over in the guardly proceedings.

[Speaker 3]
You're not going to re-roll?

[Speaker 2]
Nope.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, you held that conversation fantastically. So we just have to go to the guardhouse or whatnot.

All right.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry. So just from my understanding, just make sure I got this right. You went up to the guy and ask, Hey, is any guys around here that we can blackmail?

[Speaker 2]
We were like, I was pitching it like, Hey, we've report. We've received a report that one of these guards around here is being blackmailed in some way.

[Speaker 1]
Is there any one that you have dirt on that gets blackmailed?

[Speaker 2]
No, it's being blackmailed. Do you know of anybody that's like trying to fuck with your guards? Do you know of anybody?

Do you have any criminals around here that are trying to fuck with your guards?

[Speaker 1]
It'd be like going up to a police officer and saying, Hey, are any of your companions being blackmailed?

[Speaker 2]
Speaking from personal experience, it's typically, it doesn't go terribly well.

[Speaker 1]
Just making sure I got that part right, because I'm like, I'm pretty sure he's asking this guard. Hey, are any of your friends being blackmailed?

[Speaker 3]
We would like to solve that problem.

[Speaker 1]
What are they over? By some random adventurers.

[Speaker 3]
We have a professional investigator here. Random investigators. No such thing.

[Speaker 1]
If I've ever watched a cop show, that makes it so much worse. Oh, yeah, for sure.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we could go to the guardhouse. We could also attempt to sneak in. What would you like to do?

Guardhouse it is. Okay. Off we go.

I don't know which direction it's in.

[Speaker 1]
Where are you going?

[Speaker 3]
Guardhouse.

[Speaker 1]
The guardhouse? Guardhouse would be off the map. It would just be like the city's guardhouse.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Like the barracks where the guards stay.

[Speaker 3]
All right. So just, I suppose, imagine we're there.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. You spend like 20 minutes getting there. You get to the guardhouse.

Hello! Geoffrey's a little bit hesitant to enter into the guardhouse. Yeah, he stays outside.

He's like, why are we going to the guardhouse for? Oh, we are trying to see if we can get on their good side. And after we get on their good side, tavern time.

Like, you're going to ask the guards if it's right? That we raid a tavern?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. What we're going to do is we're going to ask them if any of their guards are in trouble. And if we can help them.

Because we want to help the noble folks of... Where are we? Which town is this?

They're like paused. Which town is this? We want to help the noble folks of this town.

Bromloch. Yes, of course. This town in Bromloch.

They were specifically asking about the town's name, but it's not really needed here.

[Speaker 4]
I don't need to worry about the guards.

[Speaker 1]
You want to worry about helping me. I'm in trouble.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, yes, yes.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to be a lot worse than what happens to the guards.

[Speaker 4]
If we get the guards on our side, no trouble whatsoever, right? I mean, I would have thought if the guards were doing something wrong, they would have done something about it already.

[Speaker 3]
Fair enough. All right, I suppose... In front of the guardhouse, we just like turn heel then?

Unless the other people would like to talk with the guard captain?

[Speaker 4]
What was the name of that tavern? Sorry, what did you say?

[Speaker 5]
What was the name of that tavern that the loan shark deals out of?

[Speaker 4]
The Oily Goose. Wily Goose? The Oily.

Oily? Yep. Fantastic name.

It's great, it leads up to a bunch of things.

[Speaker 1]
This name was done before James posted that goose picture in the sewers chat.

[Speaker 4]
They think James could be me. Just for context...

[Speaker 5]
I was about to question if, what kind of mount can a centaur get?

[Speaker 1]
Just for context, just in regards to everyone would know this, that Bronnock, you know, while there might be some guards that might do a bit of a shady side, or they take a little bit, they don't blatantly allow illegal stuff happens and they will crack down on it.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Unless it's approved, in which case they won't do anything about it anyway.

[Speaker 3]
We could... oh, approved illegal stuff, okay. I was going to say, we could bring the law down on the loan sharks and then there'll be no problem of a loan.

[Speaker 4]
We can probably steal it. Or the guards confiscate all the money.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's true. We should probably rob them and then take a ledger and then like a week later be like, oh, we found this somewhere.

[Speaker 4]
All right, robbery it is.

[Speaker 3]
Again, when James comes back, then we can talk about if we're going to do the guard route first.

[Speaker 4]
In the meantime... Could ask what guards frequently oil a goose. Oh, yes, that's probably wise.

Yes, yes.

[Speaker 3]
But we need your input, James, because we want to know if you would like to go along with the guard idea, or if we're just straight up going to turn heel and go around the back.

[Speaker 4]
Do you want to take a five minute break while James is going to the bathroom? All right, fair enough. Let's do that.

[Speaker 3]
In the meantime, oh, I can't give Jeffrey a business card. This is a terrible, terrible day.

[Speaker 4]
You can't.

[Speaker 3]
No, I can't. I don't have permission.

[Speaker 4]
Aw. Well, Hart, you can listen to that thing I sent you. It's only about three minutes.

Oh. Ah. Ah, okay.

Give me a sec. Let me mute myself. Kind of awesome.

[Speaker 5]
Bring along a character that, girl, I can't investigate. Can't really talk to people. Can't intimidate.

Can't lie.

[Speaker 4]
Can't sneak. You can cause a distraction. Yeah.

Start a bar fight. Start a bar fight! Two thousand pound centaur starts a bar fight.

That'd make a good story. It would. For a fighter, he's, like, trained in, like, ten skills.

Ten skills is a pretty good option. Yeah, still can't figure out why my other character has a speed of fifteen.

[Speaker 1]
Probably armor. Do you have low strength?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, but it's light armor. There's no speed penalty. Plus, it's a goblin.

There should be a base of twenty-five.

[Speaker 4]
There could be. They're over-encumbered.

[Speaker 5]
I have to go check on Meek-Shee, because I noticed that when I just logged in. I was like, whoa.

[Speaker 9]
We might check later. Oh, right.

[Speaker 4]
Let's ask the guardsfolk about who frequents the tavern. And if they have any information on the people. So, I'll knock.

Where are you knocking? On the guard tower place, so we can be left alone. Or can we just wander in?

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I mean, barracks aren't normally pretty to have with people just wandering. There'll be, like, a little guard out front, and it'll interrupt you, so you need to come up close.

And, like, greeting citizens! How can we help you today?

[Speaker 3]
Hello! We here are here on just a small investigation. We were wondering if you knew if any of your guards went to that tavern over there.

We've heard strange, strange things, and would love more information on it.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, I just blinked out. Was that sorry?

[Speaker 3]
Okay. We were just wondering if you knew anything about the Oily Goose. We heard some strange things about it, so if any of your guards knew anything at all that could clear up the air, that would be fantastic!

[Speaker 4]
Like, Oily Goose, Oily Goose, Oily Goose.

[Speaker 1]
Normally, if there's any complaints about people doing any wrongdoing, we'll investigate the matter. Some places are just naturally shady. Unfortunately, you know, people are like that, citizens are part of it.

There may be some shady places there. It's best to stay away from places, upstanding citizens like yourselves, to stay away from places like that, just in case there is any issues.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, thank you very much for your help, mister... Does the gesture asking for a name?

[Speaker 4]
Jacob. Mr. Jacob. Lovely name.

We'll do our best to avoid the place completely. Good to hear. Thank you for your help.

If we need any more, we'll come right here. Okay. Otherwise, you can just contact a normal guard, and normally they'll assist you if you have any emergencies.

Okie doke.

[Speaker 3]
Do any of you guys have any input? Because that's about the amount Levent's going to do. Otherwise, they're going to sneak around the back and steal stuff.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I would've just asked them if they had good drinks there. Whether we succeed or not, we should at least get a little buzzed or drunk and get something out of it. Because this guy would like barely two coppers to pitch together.

I mean, you can go there for a drink. If you'd like. You're right.

[Speaker 3]
We can begin wandering off and discussing the plan. A plan.

[Speaker 4]
Which can be that... Mr. Teg over here? Yeah, scout the area.

See what's around. Alright, let's see if there's anything of note around the area before we... Before we dive right in.

As you can see on the map, there is... Here. You can walk around.

There are windows, there are doors. It does attach to another building. Oh, what's the other building?

I don't know. Fair enough. It's just a general shop.

Clothes shop. Merchant shop. Tavern.

Attached.

[Speaker 3]
To a general shop. We could also sneak in through there if worse comes to worst. But, I suppose we could go through a window.

[Speaker 1]
This is a pretty decent marketplace. You've got a little market square here, you've got your observing shops down there.

[Speaker 4]
Nice, nice. Well, we have scouted that there are some windows.

[Speaker 3]
So, what I have as a rudimentary plan is that Tig goes in the front and orders drinks and makes sure the attention is on the giant centaur who came to order drinks. While the rest of us sneak around the back. A person can stay with Tig to make sure nothing terrible happens and can investigate the front.

So, there could be two in front to make sure something happens. They can even stage a bar fight between each other. The other two go around the back and do some sneaking around.

[Speaker 4]
How does that sound, folks? Door is up there if you'd like to go in.

[Speaker 3]
So, how does that sound? Who wants to be in the sneaky mission? Who wants to be in the front?

I'm being moved. Don't put me in yet!

[Speaker 4]
Just put me in the doorway. So, if you go down here I'll move you down here as well too. So, you can see inside.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you're going to be able to see this information really. You can go in there because you're scouting around. So, general place in there.

This area here is closed off so you can't really see inside there. There is a door. It doesn't appear to be for general use.

So, it's got like a little staff-only door.

[Speaker 4]
Okey-doke.

[Speaker 3]
McCannon, you're the investigator. Come along. Can you move McCannon so he can also see since James is AoE?

He's also being sneaky.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. So, as before, you can see inside here. So, it's a tavern.

Plenty of patrons. Some pretty drunk. As you get closer to this door, it appears to be like a service door for the kitchen.

[Speaker 4]
You get the smell of general foods. You know, roast pork cooking, stews, things of that nature. And that's all you can really see.

Those two rooms. There is some more, but nothing they can see from the outside.

[Speaker 3]
So, McCannon wishes to be on the sneak team. Jeffrey, how good are you at being on the sneak team? Wait, that's the wrong voice.

Jeffrey, my man, how do you feel about being on the sneak team? Or would you like to be with Tig?

[Speaker 1]
If I was sneaky, I would have done it already. I don't think it's best that I go in there.

[Speaker 3]
Unless I have the money.

[Speaker 1]
Otherwise, I don't think I'll come back out.

[Speaker 3]
Entirely fair. You will be ripped to pieces. Alright, just stay out here, I suppose.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to stay out here by the little gala. Enjoy the water. Keep an eye out.

If anything happens, watch the signal that I give in case something bad happens.

[Speaker 4]
You scream very loudly.

[Speaker 1]
What do I scream? Because screaming something in front of the guards isn't going to be a very good thing.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my god, you're a cool bird. Caw-caw. Yeah, that works.

Make a crow sound. If something happens, I do a very loud caw-caw.

[Speaker 3]
Sure. Or, to make it less suspicious, point out how there's a really cool bird. Point at a pigeon or something.

People will just think you're weird, but we'll know that it's because of the signal.

[Speaker 4]
So, if I see something bad, I say caw-caw. Yeah. Wow, cool bird.

Alright.

[Speaker 1]
He goes over here and looks at some random wildlife. Yeah, like that.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I am stuck in the wall.

[Speaker 3]
If you don't mind to drag me out. I'm in a tree, I suppose, but yes, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
You're trying to look for a wall. There's a little gate here, it's a gate of community. Little gates everywhere.

You don't want to look too crazy jumping over fences and such, do you? In front of the guards.

[Speaker 3]
Would McKanan work better alone in being the staff inspector, or would he prefer company in the back? Because I have decent stealth, but poor thievery. So I can help with that, or I can help with Tig.

Okay, work better alone. I'll be in the front with Tig endearing ourselves to the customer and or staging a bar fight. Mr. Tig, my great and fantastic friend, we are going inside. McKanan, do your thing. Does it like a thumbs up?

[Speaker 5]
What kind of drinks are we going to get?

[Speaker 3]
Fear is always a great choice and despite being very small, will like put an arm around you to give the friendship thing.

[Speaker 4]
In we go. I'm being stepped on.

[Speaker 1]
The door is clearly not designed for a central.

[Speaker 5]
I'll suck in my gut.

[Speaker 1]
You managed to squeeze in and it's quite a tight fit. Immediately as you start to enter in, you notice there are quite a lot of people sitting around drinking and the waitress, Tracy, she's got a little name tag on her, goes, howdy folks, how can I help you today?

[Speaker 3]
Hello, me and my good buddy are new around the area. We were wondering if we could have some of your finest drinks, especially this little big guy. He hasn't drank a lot before, sir.

[Speaker 1]
She looks a little hesitant on her face and goes, as you can see around here, we're pretty busy. I don't think there's going to be enough room for both of y'all in here today. Might need to come back at a later time.

There's a few other fine establishments nearby.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, he can squeeze in, can't you? Pointed look at Tig.

[Speaker 1]
He looks around at Matt. Anywhere you think you'll fit.

[Speaker 4]
I'm more graceful than I look. See, he's more graceful. Come on, bud.

[Speaker 1]
We only really have no chairs. We don't have anything really.

[Speaker 4]
If you want more, there will be enough room for the table.

[Speaker 1]
Is he trained?

[Speaker 5]
Does it look like I need a chair?

[Speaker 3]
Like I pat him like one would do a prize horse. He is very trained. Well, I believe he is.

[Speaker 4]
Are you, Tig, my good sir?

[Speaker 1]
Quite a few people in here. You can see they've got little descriptions based on what kind of impression you'd get from them. A couple of farmers, a couple of commoners, people who live in the city.

Some of them appear quite drunken. As you try to stumble past, this guy is like, oh. If I knew I was going to be at this farm, I would have stayed at home and drunk.

When the others quip, he's like, oh, it's just your style too, isn't it?

[Speaker 5]
I get that a lot, but unlike your cattle, I can drink you under the table.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah!

[Speaker 5]
Ten times his body mass, it's pretty easy.

[Speaker 4]
Drinking fight, let's go!

[Speaker 3]
While they're doing that, Levent will close the door so McKanan can go around his sneaking business.

[Speaker 1]
So you notice the door there leads to the kitchen, pretty obvious signs, got staff, no entry. The other ones up there is also a no entry. I forgot to do the stairs!

I accidentally deleted the stairs, I should say. That's okay. And so there's the stairs up here.

[Speaker 4]
Are we allowed to go up the stairs? So the stairs are there, and there's nothing really stopping you from going up there. Okay.

Miss Joyce, are the stairs more tables that we could perhaps sit at?

[Speaker 1]
It's kind of for some of the more sophisticated clients of ours.

[Speaker 3]
Are you saying that we aren't sophisticated? Don't worry, they know exactly what they look like.

[Speaker 1]
It's not so much that doesn't give sophistication, just a bit of a bit of a cost to go up there, if you understand what I'm saying. I see, I see.

[Speaker 4]
Well, we'll stay right here for now.

[Speaker 1]
Make sure you need the funds to go up there so you don't interrupt those fine gentlemen.

[Speaker 4]
Okey dokey. Handing over to McKanan. McKanan, in front of you, you see there is a tavern.

[Speaker 1]
There is a few windows that bring illumination into the common bathroom hall. There is a side door that goes into the kitchen, which is also like a service door for entries of supplies and goods. You don't really see much other visible entry points into the tavern.

[Speaker 4]
How would you like to proceed?

[Speaker 1]
With enough strength and force, you believe you could break down a wall, which would cause quite a noise, as with most walls.

[Speaker 4]
A Japanese paper wall? It's a brick and mortar wall, really, all around. Like most of these buildings, brick and mortar, some timber inside.

And you left the guy with the highest athletics and a mule kick out in bar to drink. You also feel like you have a bit of a waitress joysie. She has quite an allure to her as well.

When you're near her, you kind of feel a little bit persuaded to anything that she says. She really has this kind of darling presence.

[Speaker 3]
I sit on one of the benches and I'll just be like, So, Miss Joysie, must I say you look lovely today.

[Speaker 4]
Well, thank you. Is there anything you'd recommend on the menu?

[Speaker 1]
We've got some beer, we've got some stew, but we've got a wizard in the kitchen back there. He can almost whip you up anything that you want.

[Speaker 4]
Right.

[Speaker 5]
If you want to excuse the pun, give me a pony keg of your finest ale.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, you do have to beat that farmer in shots.

[Speaker 1]
I might need to explain a little bit more in detail what that is. We use the standard measurement system in this tavern. I'm not too sure what size a pony keg is.

[Speaker 4]
It'd be a liter. No, about...

[Speaker 5]
What would that be in liters? I'm trying to think in gallons here.

[Speaker 1]
I just don't know what a pony keg is. I'm not sure if it's a slang for something.

[Speaker 5]
No, it's a pony keg. It's like a dwarven keg. It's something you can actually carry around under an arm.

It's almost like carrying a five gallon bucket or twenty liters of whatever.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it's like a five gallon keg?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, something like that. Let me just quickly check how much kegs are. Oh, those are modern ones.

Oh, here we go. Keg of the ale will set you back two silver pieces. That seems reasonable.

[Speaker 1]
I was going to say, none of those kegs are pony sizes.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I switched them to the... Oh, is this still the wrong one? Aye yai yai.

[Speaker 1]
That's the Acorni keg and the Gregg.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, Gregg. Hold on. Let me copy the image, please.

Alright, here we go.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just saying, if you say five gallons, I can figure that out. I'm just like...

[Speaker 4]
Ah, a tall pony and a short pony. So, 7.75 gallons.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so while you are chugging the farmer under... drinking under the table, I am going to go start conversing with folks and just ask their general opinion of, like, oh, do you like this place? I've heard this and that about it, but, you know, first time here.

I'm going to go make friends with people.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, as you start getting ready to talk to people, she knocks on the door and is like, oh, can I get a keg? They're going to do a bit of a drink in here. And you hear a loud, horrible...

And she walks through this door and she opens up the door, and as she holds out her hand, the keg kind of comes to her hand, and the door closes, and she brings the keg out over here, places it on the table, and the drunken farmer's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, what an idiot. We're going to drink him under the table.

[Speaker 4]
And he's going to be more than happy to move there and start drinking with you.

[Speaker 3]
What do I roll to make friends with people? Just be like, this place is nice.

[Speaker 4]
Roll a wallet check. A what? A wallet check.

[Speaker 3]
A wallet check?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. You show how much gold you have.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not doing that. I'm going to get robbed.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sorry, that's the best way to make friends. I have so much money.

[Speaker 3]
I will show my silver. I'm not showing them I have gold on me. Be like, oh, look.

Isn't this place nice? Can you tell me any cool things about this place, maybe?

[Speaker 1]
When you show the silver, and you ask the question, can I reach out and grab the silver?

[Speaker 3]
I slap a hand. I'll buy you a drink if you give me information.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is a great place. Delicious food. They point to the drinks on the tables.

And the food. There's a little bit of bread. Some kind of meat.

Looks like white meat. I assume it is a fowl of some sort. Delicious food.

Good people. Yeah!

[Speaker 4]
Always easy on the eyes. Great place to drink. No dubious nonsense.

[Speaker 3]
And no dubious nonsense.

[Speaker 1]
When you say that, he does a fake laugh. We are fine, upstanding citizens. Thank you very much.

And they all have a little chuckle and laugh.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, alright. How much would be a round? How many people are here?

[Speaker 1]
For a mug of ale, it's a copper.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, that's fine. I ask Miss Josie to get a round of ale for all of them, which will set me back six copper.

[Speaker 1]
Everyone cheers when you do that. And they start to warm up to you. You see the door opens for a second.

It's looking quite rough. Gives her a tray full of drinks.

[Speaker 4]
And then she'll pass that out to everyone around. Drink up, sweethearts.

[Speaker 3]
I will abstain from drinking because it is I'm buying people around, but friendly times. I'm going to see if I can get up the stairs while people are...

[Speaker 1]
You're not buying yourself a drink?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I'll have one.

[Speaker 4]
Might as well stay on the good side of these folks. And then, Miss, can I please have I wonder if I can do this for you. So you should have an alcohol in your inventory and if you click on it I will get you to a save, please.

A DC-12 Fort save. I believe you can click on it in the chat.

[Speaker 5]
Should I hero point that?

[Speaker 1]
Have you ever had a way, like, you've drunk some kind of alcohol then you've drunk, like, tequila or something, and it's just hit differently? So if you constantly drink beer all the time, then you try some other kind of alcohol you kind of get a different kind of tolerance to it?

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Well, this is the situation now. This beer is hitting you just right and giving you good buzz.

[Speaker 4]
I'm starting to think I should have pre-gamed before the mission. Let's see if I can get to stage 7. If you get to stage 1, it's fine.

You're good.

[Speaker 1]
One of the drunks over here is like, you know, if you're buying a drink, you might be rich enough to play the games upstairs.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. What games go on upstairs?

[Speaker 1]
You've got poker, dragon ante, other games of that sort.

[Speaker 3]
I'll go up to this door and I'll go check that out. I want to go to this door real quick and be like I want to thank the chef. What do you call the drinks member?

The bartender. They've done a performative sip, sort of, just the top of it. It's like, wow, this tastes great.

I'd like to thank the bartender.

[Speaker 4]
The bartender's over there. You got the drinks from here, though. Alright.

Yeah, that's just the storage room where we keep our drinks fresh and cool. Well, I'll thank the storage man.

[Speaker 1]
If you slide over a little bit. You'll see him in there. And when you open up the door, he looks at you and he's like, what?

Good job on the drinks! Ah, sorry! And he waves you off.

[Speaker 4]
Upstairs it is, then.

[Speaker 1]
The thing's moving around the kitchen that shouldn't have been moving in there.

[Speaker 4]
What was moving in there? The utensils, the knives, some of the items. Can I thank the storage man for his good wine management?

I mean, they're gonna look at you weirdly, but yeah, sure! Splendid! Is he okay?

I heard he was with John. You just pick the door open and he's like, thanks, sir, or whatever. Does he look okay?

[Speaker 1]
There is a door behind him. He's looking kind of more like a bouncer rather than a waiter. And you also don't see any...

He looks kind of rough. One might expect he's a security guard or a fighter back in those days.

[Speaker 4]
He is also armed. I'll go upstairs before I start any nonsense in the back here. Okay.

That is good information to know. My upstairs adventures can happen after McKanan's adventures. Is he back?

Ah, hello!

[Speaker 1]
James, can you currently see the map? I can see the map, yeah. Okay, perfect.

So you see there is a door up here, a door down here which is the general entrance. This one up here is the service entry. I'm just gonna move you in here, so this is essentially what you can see from the outside.

[Speaker 2]
I was gonna go through the server's entry and try to figure out if I could block my way.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, roll stealth. Are you gonna be sneaky or are you gonna be like, oh hey, you know, I'm a city official, yada yada. That's what you mentioned about before.

[Speaker 2]
I wanna use intimidation for the city official thing, if I can.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Ah, that door isn't lining up. When you open up the door, you see the chef there and his working stuff.

There is an oven, there's a bakery place, he's preparing some food, cabinet portions, and you knock on the door, what do you say when you come inside and you walk into the kitchen?

[Speaker 2]
Are you kidding me? It was supposed to be closed down today, didn't they tell you?

[Speaker 1]
He looks at you like, what are you talking about?

[Speaker 2]
Closing that oven. Came from the wrong spot, they got shimmer sand in them. They're supposed to cook off, well they were supposed to be disposed of and cooked off in about 30 minutes from now, assuming that we lit them up at 8 in the morning.

[Speaker 1]
Give us an arcane check, please.

[Speaker 10]
Can I substitute a copy?

[Speaker 1]
Sure. Oh, sweet. Being with your knowledge of magic, you notice that these aren't normal equipment.

You notice some of the utensils, even one who's distracted, are still moving. The fire is smokeless, and it doesn't appear to be using any fuel. It's not a wood fire, it's just a He's visibly concentrating on things.

He's focusing. You can tell when you speak to someone and they've got something on their mind and they're busy and they're preoccupied. You definitely get that vibe from him.

In all sense you get, there is magic in place, especially with the utensils moving about in the sky.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just inspect to make sure that the coals haven't gone anywhere, because it seems like you haven't used them for the fire. I do need to figure out where they are.

[Speaker 1]
You do know where you're entering into, right? The oily goose?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, this is the kitchen, right? Has an oven?

[Speaker 4]
No.

[Speaker 2]
I'm lying to him, saying that I'm going to check it to see. I'm implying that there's some kind of fuel that's been dispensed into his kitchen, but was not supposed to be. It hasn't been added to your oven, clearly, because it's not using fuel.

I've got to go looking for it. I'll just leave you to your business.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, just be mindful. Focus on the work. You need to be careful where you move.

The knife swings out wide off the table there, in the air. Almost like a cutting motion.

[Speaker 2]
Is that a trapdoor?

[Speaker 4]
A basement?

[Speaker 2]
Am I in cum, pizza? Are there kids down here?

[Speaker 1]
There is a trapdoor right there, next to him. These loan sharks are...

[Speaker 2]
Are you going to go down the trapdoor? If I can do it sneakily. Let's see if I can take a peek, because what I'm hoping is that the guy's concentrating on the stuff in front of him.

[Speaker 1]
It's quite a heavy door.

[Speaker 2]
I think I smell it, down here. Must have come with your last shipment.

[Speaker 1]
Drums about it. Focus on his tasks. Whenever you walk from the fire, it seems to stutter a little bit.

You're more than welcome to try and open up that door if you'd like. I'll give it a shot. It's quite a thick trapdoor.

It leads down to the ladder. There is a staircase going down there. It's about a 10 foot room.

It has quite a bit of meats and cheeses. It's what you'd expect for an ice room for a ladder in the Wild West. It's quite cool.

[Speaker 2]
I checked for any other doors or secrets that might be attached to the ladder.

[Speaker 1]
Then, give us a check. So, perception, if you're just having a quick squiz. Other relevant checks based on how you're searching about.

As you're walking down, you're really focused on a certain section. You notice that you kind of don't follow the safety rails. There's no safety rails there.

You kind of step off the step. You fall about 5 feet. Stumble a bit.

Make a bit of a noise. Careful down there. If you break anything, you've got to pay for it.

Where exactly do you say you're from?

[Speaker 2]
The city will pay for any kind of damages. They weren't supposed to send you these calls to begin with. Don't you worry.

[Speaker 1]
They keep them in the city. He's like, do you have any paperwork or anything to verify where you're from? He's quite agitated now.

[Speaker 6]
I did, until I tripped. Give me a moment. I've got to look for it.

I think I lost my glasses.

[Speaker 1]
I think if you don't have any paperwork, I think it's best that you leave and get some.

[Speaker 7]
No, it's with me. I just lost it. My wallet's fallen off.

My glasses have fallen off. Give me a moment.

[Speaker 1]
He's like, don't worry. I'll wait.

[Speaker 6]
I'm like, padding around. While they're looking for any other trip doors.

[Speaker 1]
The floor is stone. It's quite cool to the touch, but you don't notice anything around there. There are quite a few.

The floor is stone. Like stone blocks. It's quite cool to the touch.

You don't find any sort of further doors going down or access to any other pathways. There are quite a few barrels holding supplies and goods. You wouldn't really know what's inside them unless you open it up.

[Speaker 2]
Hold on. My partner's outside. I'm going to go get his papers.

I think that would be best. He's in the wagon. What do you think?

We walk everywhere? Shitty officials. Got to put that budget to some good use.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think it might be best if you go get your documentations and return them before there's any other unexpected accidents that might occur here.

[Speaker 7]
My goodness.

[Speaker 6]
Help me up. I'm tipsy.

[Speaker 2]
I'm stumbling outside the room. What did he find down there?

[Speaker 4]
A larder.

[Speaker 1]
A storage room for supplies. It's like a cooled box. Normally they do it underground because it reduces the temperature of goods.

It stores the meat. He's got links of sausages. A couple of barrels down there.

Basically it's a storage.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
He also loved that implicit threat. 10 out of 10.

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to go look for my TV.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so you go for the front door. Straight away you can see Tig.

[Speaker 1]
He's looking pretty drunk. Or he's starting to get tipsy. And he's drinking with a farmer who's making rude gestures now about him looking like that horse he once mated.

[Speaker 4]
Trying to be insulting. You see LaVance over here. It looks like she's just about to go upstairs.

As you enter in, you notice the waitress. She notices you open the door and she's starting to approach. She gives like a little wave.

A threat?

[Speaker 2]
No, I'm going to go find her.

[Speaker 1]
All I heard was a threat.

[Speaker 2]
The waitress is speaking for a threat.

[Speaker 4]
You see LaVance is just over there, about to climb the stairs.

[Speaker 1]
LaVance, as you're about to climb the stairs, you notice the door opens you take a quick glance and you see there is McCann in there.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. I'll do like a small wave and just ask things like, oh, should I come over or are you good?

[Speaker 6]
I'm going to indicate them I'm following you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Okay, I continue up the stairs then. I just mentally hope that Tig will be okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, he'll be fine.

[Speaker 3]
Fantastic.

[Speaker 5]
It's not like he's wearing any weapons to look threatening.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I imagine you're wearing new weapons and that's why people are a little bit concerned about you with your javelins, your spike shields, your chainmail armor with skirting.

[Speaker 5]
You know, he's going to put it away so he doesn't need to be wearing his gauntlets and everything while he's drinking. It makes it hard to pick up the mug.

[Speaker 1]
So you're saying you're unarmored at the moment?

[Speaker 5]
He's unarmed. He still has his armor on.

[Speaker 4]
Perfect. Okay, so Levant's going to head upstairs. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect. Levant, as you head upstairs you see McCann and see the signal that he's following you. And McCann, as you start to go in, you're greeted by Waitress Joycey She's like, howdy-o, how's it going?

What can I help you with today?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, I was wondering if you could get me a lager, please.

[Speaker 1]
Certainly, darling. We'll be just behind cover. And she'll like go over here and she'll say something and she'll have like a nice frosty mug of lager and she'll be back within like 20 seconds.

You see she just walks to the door. She's a little bit busy at the moment If people don't mind you sitting next to them, just take a seat where there is a spot free. And if there's anything else you can help me with, just give us a wave.

[Speaker 2]
You got it. I'll take a seat next to the farmers next to the staircase. Or patrons.

[Speaker 10]
I used to try some fire whiskey.

[Speaker 1]
Did you say the fire whiskey?

[Speaker 5]
I think he's trying to get more drunk than him. He knows fire whiskey has more of a punch to it. He doesn't know if they serve that there.

[Speaker 4]
He's just guessing.

[Speaker 1]
If you are talking about some extra beverages Hear the farmers when you hear about the strongest stuff. Joycey is after the house special! And she's looking a little bit hesitant about you.

About it. And then she looks at you for a confirmation.

[Speaker 5]
I've traveled across the land. There's nothing this house has special that I've probably not had before. Bring it so I may confirm my suspicions.

Yes, how far can I dig this hole? Yes.

[Speaker 1]
She goes to the door and she's a little bit hesitant How outstanding and virtuous do you get the vibe of being? You don't really seem like someone of a sneaky type.

[Speaker 5]
No, he seems well kept He keeps some sort of image of not prestige, but someone who cares somewhat about his looks because he tries to get people to do things to better themselves. It's hard to put it into words. You know he's crap at diplomas.

He has to do it visually.

[Speaker 1]
What kind of sense? You know I like to say some people you get the vibe of good natured things of that nature. And then you get other people that just appear really shady.

How shady do you seem?

[Speaker 5]
Probably not at all. He used to be almost like a professional sports player, so he probably couldn't get away with that if he tried. So more like, probably friendly more outgoing.

Probably leaves people gullible and easy to take advantage of you know, something like that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, she comes back she has two mugs.

[Speaker 1]
A quick glint is the mugs are definitely different. How special for you? And she'll hand it to the farmer and she goes, one for you too sweetie.

And she'll put the other mug in front of you.

[Speaker 4]
Splendid. A shot glass. How quaint.

She gets to the farmer a bit of a scornful look.

[Speaker 1]
But otherwise she continues on the farmer. She has a bright smile back in her face and she goes, hope you enjoy sweetie. And she'll go back to talking to some random people.

[Speaker 4]
Can I get another alcohol check?

[Speaker 5]
Same one or a new check?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, just do the DC12 Fortitude again if you want to scroll up a little bit or I can post it again.

[Speaker 5]
Come on Nat 1, show me the money.

[Speaker 4]
Dammit. That's good.

[Speaker 1]
I think you can voluntarily fail saves, bud. Do you wish to voluntarily fail a save? No.

[Speaker 4]
You can't buy it from stumbling and stepping over people. Unless I want to do that.

[Speaker 1]
What are you doing? You're now around these people so I'm not too visibly happy that you're with them. But you know, they're still, you know like when a stranger walks up and you change your topics.

You know, they're just talking pleasantry to some random gibberish at the moment. And the bank has gone upstairs.

[Speaker 6]
You wouldn't happen to know where to go if somebody needed some money, would you?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, a little bit of that. Well, obviously the bank. Or the city lord.

[Speaker 2]
I got turned down for a loan because I'm an adventurer. Bank doesn't want to bankroll rat catchers. If I die out there I stop making payments.

I understand their predicament, but you know.

[Speaker 1]
How upstanding does McKinnon look?

[Speaker 2]
McKinnon is Columbo. Like, looks not completely disheveled, but rumpled. Right?

Not slovenly, but definitely rumpled.

[Speaker 5]
Like Borderlands stoned?

[Speaker 2]
Rumpled. Just rumpled.

[Speaker 1]
One of the guys is like, how much you talking about?

[Speaker 2]
Just enough to carry a few wagon repairs. It's vintage. You know.

Maybe 50, 100 gold. Somewhere between there. Should be enough for the repairs.

Make sure I get on my way.

[Speaker 1]
When you say 50 to 100 gold, it's like, what kind of wagon are you repairing? It's vintage.

[Speaker 2]
What can you say? I'll tell you what, it's a good thing to use as collateral. As long as it's working.

[Speaker 1]
It's a frigging wagon as collateral?

[Speaker 2]
It's a little bit larger on the inside than the outside. That's the biggest of that.

[Speaker 1]
When you mention that, you notice the noise just perks up a little bit. It's like, honey, if you need some help with that. I think I might have something that can help you out with that.

If you want to go upstairs, just ask for the boss.

[Speaker 6]
Upstairs and ask him for the boss. You got it.

[Speaker 5]
Wagon upholding with shag carpeting.

[Speaker 2]
What a bit of shag going on. I'm going to walk up there and follow and ask for the boss. This is my favorite bar in town.

[Speaker 1]
Oops. Double McCannon. How's the problem?

Perfect. You guys go upstairs and it is a nice, fine place. There is a couple of games tables.

There is... There is a couple of people playing games around this table.

[Speaker 4]
Let me just quickly check them down. You see there's a bartender.

[Speaker 1]
And a couple of people playing a game like a dragon's ante. I'll drop down the party token. So he's not left in the dark.

Perfect. So he's there. He's got a couple of people playing around with him.

There's a guard at the top. Person over there pouring drinks if you want it.

[Speaker 4]
Looks like a guard.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, sorry. Just as a quick thing. When we were going up here, are these doors accessible?

[Speaker 1]
Before you go in there, would you like to go a little wander around?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Yes, I would. I'm going to close that door.

Hang on. Just so I don't accidentally go down the stairs, which is the downstairs place? Or are all these rooms we can just go into?

[Speaker 1]
So you should be able to go into there, yeah. Sick. Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
I'll just wander in here.

[Speaker 1]
The hallway does not actually have a doorway. See? Not going down there!

That is an oversight.

[Speaker 3]
You can just tell us if it's an actual room or if we can't go there.

[Speaker 1]
You should be able to interact as if you can.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that one works.

[Speaker 3]
This one does not.

[Speaker 1]
It is locked. So that's the doorway where you came. That's essentially the staircase.

[Speaker 3]
I'll go over here. Since we're in a hallway with no one here, I'll ask my cannon. Hey, do you want to go with me or do you want to go off and explore other places?

[Speaker 7]
Let me go up and...

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to head out to take a nap before work. I would like to do my best to distract the boss. Kind of wind him on his way.

Be the big distraction, the distracting client to the boss. Primarily by offering... One, I have my wagon, but I'd rather not offer it as collateral as possible.

What I'd like to do is offer my services as an investigator as collateral for the loan.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the boss is going to need something a bit more physical than your skills. Something he can hold onto to ensure you do perform your service.

[Speaker 2]
Right, so he's going to spend his time negotiating that with like... Okay, well if that's the case, what's something that you might need from somebody? You know, what's something I can go get for you?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, ooh. He'll have a think and ponder about that and you'll see he'll signal over the little guard to him. I'm just going to move you in this room just because you're chatting with him.

They're also doing some small talk over a game. If you want to join in, you're more than welcome to. But he'll talk about the guard and the guard will seem to walk off.

And the guard seems to go downstairs for a second. He'll leave him alone for a second. Yep, and then so you'll be in a little chat there.

Sorry, and you said that you need to head off now?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I got to take a nap before work. My hope is that I can serve as a distraction for the boss in that room. Just negotiating back and forth.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you'll be able to negotiate it. And yeah, you'll be able to distract them and they'll be busy while Levant does their thing.

[Speaker 3]
Is the guard supposed to be there?

[Speaker 1]
The guard will be passing you by. So you see the guard walks by and he'll walk downstairs.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. That's fine. Let's start down the hallway.

Might as well, might as well. Oh, this goes all the way around.

[Speaker 7]
Alright folks, I shall see you later. Best of luck on your hike.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you, good night.

[Speaker 5]
I feel like I should redo Para's 16th level. It kind of died when I added my feet, but I think I didn't lose anything, so I think I'm fine.

[Speaker 2]
But yeah, it's working now perfectly again, so it's all good.

[Speaker 1]
All right, I talked a little bit with Fatigue, whose name is very appropriate. They just, I, like, they clearly just wanted something else. No, no, well, it turns out, no, the opposite.

They wanted to play ASAP, but also they don't have much time this week. But also, they didn't want to get their hopes up, and it's like, this person needs medication. Don't we all.

Hey Nessie.

[Speaker 7]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Sir, can you not be sitting on my arms? I'll continue talking with them. They were pretty quick to give up.

I respect them knowing what they want, but I don't know what they want, so give away your respect immediately. They do not understand what they want. They gave the illusion of knowing what they want, kind of, but no, I don't doubt that they- No, it's like, Texas Tomboy and I breaking up about, what, oh, I guess literally a month ago now, initially, and then a conversation a week later, and then a conversation two weeks later, it's like, eh, eh, eh, eh, just calm down for a sec, it's okay.

Talk about your feelings. And then everything's fine. Now that we are back together, I should put some nuggies on.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yes. Just the way my mother cooks them.

[Speaker 1]
What is wrong with the culinary world these days? That was so good. I'm very excited for referee chat to be the new...

[Speaker 2]
Someday, someone I've talked shit about is going to join as a referee, and they're going to see it.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, as long as they don't think to, like, search up their name, then you should be fine.

[Speaker 2]
That's why I don't use names. Hi. Hello.

How's it going?

[Speaker 3]
It's going. What did I miss?

[Speaker 2]
Ah, just talking about the newest player to join and leave the server.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, who did? I think she got a little confused, because Zykara was, it seemed like Zykara and Nameless were fighting to, like, get in on a session. And Nameless, I'm actually pretty excited about.

Bar was, Bar was, like, nervous at first. I was like, they're probably being slow. It's their first session of D&D ever.

But it seems like they're pretty excited and pretty engaged to actually do shit, so...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I was telling Nessie about it.

[Speaker 2]
I remember my first session of D&D. I played Jack the Monk, named after yours truly.

[Speaker 5]
Unsurprisingly, I played a cleric, and I honestly don't think I played a lot of D&D that day. We had a...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, but that was the other one. Zykara wanted to join. Oh, sorry.

Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
No, you're good.

[Speaker 1]
Zykara, you're not. He messaged me. He's like, why can't I play during normal hours?

I said, uh-uh. I'm like, bro, I had a conversation with you last night and told you to message me back, and he said, sorry, I fell asleep, the tranquilizers kicked in. I'm not, you will not play in a game that's after 5pm CST at all.

Ever. There is a Euro time slot. It is for you now.

[Speaker 5]
He's like, but- I'm so curious why he was so insistent on trying to tell me why he took a break. Because it's none of my business.

[Speaker 3]
I think he thinks that if he explains himself, you'll give a shit. Not realizing that nobody does.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, it doesn't affect me. It's the young guy thing. You're trained to defend, excuse, explain, rationalize, the fucking deer thing.

If you have a dick in America, that is how you were brought up. That is how you were raised. Defend, explain, excuse, rationalize.

[Speaker 3]
I need to check on that. I mean, I need to check for one.

[Speaker 1]
It is also how a bunch of other people are raised.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I've worked hard to break out of that, because really, nobody cares.

[Speaker 4]
That's the problem. I mean it in the nicest possible way. And if they care, they will figure it out.

They will ask you if they care.

[Speaker 5]
Because it doesn't affect me any. You weren't here, and now you are. It just is.

I don't need to know why. I am curious on how he's going to get his character back.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, we did kind of kill that guy.

[Speaker 4]
We didn't kill him. That's what I'm curious about.

[Speaker 2]
He's just being assimilated.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Hi, Augie. Hello.

[Speaker 2]
Who are we missing? Bara.

[Speaker 5]
One, two, three, four. We are missing someone. Who are we missing?

[Speaker 4]
Bara? Is she not missing?

[Speaker 2]
No. She didn't. Is she un?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, she might have un. Because now it's only seven.

[Speaker 2]
Don't tell any of the new players that I'm kind of fierce.

[Speaker 5]
It's Rana and her grandmas now, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
So, Rez is the one who... Rez?

[Speaker 2]
Rez was late to join, but he did actually say before I said we were full, so I was fine with him playing. And I did say that, I think.

[Speaker 5]
I think Rez undid, but I think Bar also might have, because there was eight earlier.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
And Rez was already gone.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
You might be right.

[Speaker 4]
I remember making a joke about the usual suspect, so that would have included Bar.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know if Bar has a character to play this. Actually, I guess Meryl wouldn't have...

[Speaker 2]
She could have came with... Kyrona could have come with Jesse and Rana.

[Speaker 1]
We were on the same vacation. Kyrona has to be the one on the caravan right now, because Bix is... Bix is still traveling back from the wizard tower session.

I got that wrong.

[Speaker 3]
When did we get back from that? It was the 19th, right? Or was it the 18th?

[Speaker 1]
There was a shit ton of stuff. If you look at the current day... If you look at the second of this month, a party arrives at the rogue tower.

Mimosa's caravan arrives at the search area. Return to Linwood Isle. Session start.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yo, the establishment's finished. Let's go.

[Speaker 5]
What's establishment?

[Speaker 1]
Tomorrow, the Mimosa's caravan will arrive at the Dwarven Hold, and the day after that, the dragon hunt party will return to Sierra's Keep. So we're actually going to be moving... We're not going to move the in-game calendar.

How do I put this?

[Speaker 4]
Time's fucked.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No, no, no. How do I put this?

In-game, we're going to say, basically, that, like, alright, Rana gets caught. She gets recalled to the school. After the fight with the dragon...

Actually, because I think Rana didn't participate in the dragon fight.

[Speaker 2]
Rana didn't, but Jesse did, and Jesse's the one that has to cast teleport. Jesse retroactively... Oh, no, he didn't level up until the end of the session.

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
No, so I got a way of doing it. So basically, after the dragon hunt party returns to Sierra's Keep, we're basically going to be starting the session on the 6th.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I was... Yeah, I'm happy... Like, Jesse and Rana can teleport away before they return to the Keep.

Yeah. Like, I don't think... I think I'm fine for time jail, at the very least.

[Speaker 1]
What is it? The Mimosa's caravan arrives at the search area.

[Speaker 2]
The establishment, though, is the first of the buildings that I ordered at Sierra's Keep to be built. I ordered them all at the same time, it was the shortest. We now have, like, a tavern that acts as a spy network.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that's nice.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh! In a month... I'm just here spying, and what happened earlier today?

[Speaker 2]
In about a month and a bit, Hera and Morgan will both have temples of religious worship, and Azeana will have their tower, built for spell and magical research.

[Speaker 1]
Mark those on the calendar, if you can.

[Speaker 2]
I already have.

[Speaker 3]
Any established crime rings? But why can't I see them? What the fuck?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, it is...

[Speaker 3]
We can make one! That's on Karis's to-do list, is to create a network of criminals.

[Speaker 2]
The 5th of Wolaire is when that'll be finished, James.

[Speaker 7]
The 5th of Wolaire...

[Speaker 4]
The only character I have who would help you with that is my druid grandma.

[Speaker 1]
I think you might be on the wrong... day. So the current...

[Speaker 2]
Have I skipped a month? No, I haven't. The...

So the... establishment finishes on Nolak, which was last month, right? We're up to the 3rd of Wolaire.

[Speaker 1]
No, this month is Wolaire. Uh... What?

[Speaker 2]
1050... 1056. If I go back one month, it's Nolak, yeah?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
The establishment finished, like, 3 days ago.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um, and they were about a... uh, a month behind. So I just put it to the 5th.

Can you...

[Speaker 1]
can you put me a... Can you send me a screenshot of that? It's not...

it's not super important, but...

[Speaker 2]
Um... Yeah, uh...

[Speaker 4]
It's something I set up, don't do it.

[Speaker 2]
I've got my... my bank account here in the screenshot, too. Um...

What are you... What are you asking for, exactly? The Wolaire?

Um...

[Speaker 1]
If you could take a screenshot of the simple calendar.

[Speaker 2]
Just of all three... uh, both of the dates I've got?

[Speaker 1]
Um... Just... just any of them, because what I'm wondering is, because we've been going a full year now, so I'm wondering if you accidentally went...

I'm just trying to figure out if you...

[Speaker 2]
No, all the dates are there from things you've put there. Unless you don't have access to seeing them.

[Speaker 5]
Um, we can have ones that are hidden from... Like here, I'll set one for the 7th. Um...

And then I can make it...

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'll just post these in voiceover flow.

[Speaker 5]
Save, save. Um, I just made one on the 7th, can you see it? James?

Check.

[Speaker 1]
I can...

[Speaker 2]
So you can see?

[Speaker 5]
Not. Okay, yeah, I made it for just me. And then I can edit, and I can go...

Boop! Game Master can see, and then...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, there we go, hello! Now I can see it. Where's permissions at?

Oh, yep, I see. Um... Game Master's fine.

And reference.

[Speaker 5]
There's just so...

[Speaker 2]
So many people. I'll reveal this on the... Yeah, I'll...

I'll... Yeah, I'll make that so you can see it now, James.

[Speaker 1]
Game Master, I'm gonna go back and delete the inactive logins.

[Speaker 2]
That's a lot of logins.

[Speaker 1]
That's a lot of... Yeah, I'm gonna do it, like, bite-size. Like, what's a month?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. And, like, you can just put all of their character sheets in a folder if any of them come back, or... Export, I don't know.

I just delete them all, but...

[Speaker 1]
I put them in a defunct character thing. I'll put them back. I'm gonna see if I can bully...

I'm still gonna see if I can bully Orville, Armorin, and the other guys coming back. Just, like, hey, Thressee has had you in a time loop inside the Woad, which means that you guys don't have to worry about one-to-one time. We're just gonna play through just a brief, like, military campaign of, like, max a month, but, like, just big sessions, fucking shit up for the entire month.

[Speaker 2]
Where is the Dwarven zombie hold at?

[Speaker 5]
It is this... here. Here, let me ping!

Ma'am. Why isn't it letting me ping? Oh, because I'm in the wrong section.

You're, like, almost on it.

[Speaker 2]
I always get that. Why isn't my tokens moving? Oh.

Oh, wait, it's, like, right next door.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, hold on. What's up here? What are we doing up here?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, the search area?

[Speaker 3]
Are we in the search area?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Yes.

[Speaker 4]
That's where Keebee is. Yeah, do you remember where Keebee was last week in the Dwarven city? Yes.

Yep, that's where we're going tonight.

[Speaker 7]
Yes! Yes!

[Speaker 1]
If you wanted to pick up any of your characters... We'll get to that, actually. We'll get to that.

Alright, so...

[Speaker 2]
Migrating back to the Sierra's Keep. Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
So, right now, on the 3rd, which is today, today... Yeah, that's the session start. Tomorrow, Mimosa's caravan arrives at the Dwarven hold and does their thing.

And then the day after is when the Dragonhunt party returns to Sierra's Keep. Now, who do we have intending to come along on the session today?

[Speaker 5]
I was intending to bring my new warlock Hestia Loveford. Ooh, Hestia.

[Speaker 4]
I was gonna bring my druid Old Lady Dragonborn. Very good.

[Speaker 3]
Aw, I'm bringing Old Lady Edith.

[Speaker 4]
She's high as fuck all the time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, I love her.

[Speaker 1]
And then we got... and then we have Rana, obviously. Yes.

Okay, cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Are we short on people now? How deadly have I convinced you to make this, Jane?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's fucked, man.

[Speaker 1]
Ask the ladies, actually. They could give you some very good information on how deadly you can get.

[Speaker 2]
I have three other characters we could bring.

[Speaker 4]
There's like one monster that does a minimum of 54 damage in one hit.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if Edith dies, don't bring her back.

[Speaker 5]
She's gonna throw that out there. Well, I don't think you actually can be revived if your soul is not willing. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
That is correct.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, Riveva Vohai does not have that specific thing in there.

[Speaker 4]
She does want to be tempted.

[Speaker 5]
But it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
You know.

[Speaker 4]
And then there's a creature that's beautiful eyes fuck you up. Ooh, okay. I don't remember exactly what it did, but I remember throwing my cloak over it.

[Speaker 2]
How many days has it been since we got back then?

[Speaker 1]
We'll be doing it on that particular note. Today is three days before that happened, so we're skipping ahead three days.

[Speaker 2]
I was just trying to weasel out a foraging session for Sierra.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. I don't think so. No, that's okay.

You can do that between this session and wherever, I guess. But basically, whatever you guys will do, we'll be counting on from the 5th and progressing onwards. But, okay.

So, Rana. A glowing blue orb manifests in front of you right as you're landing at the keep. There are several new and fresh faces coming to check out what the boat brought back and check out the loot and stuff like that and help carry things off and make new pledges for adventuring.

And it's at this moment that the orb expands, covering a few people's worth, and looks ready to contract when you can see a blue spectral person right in front of you. Specifically, it's the Houndmaster, the Dwarven attending to the necromantic college of Grodvok Thule. It says, Rana, Rana, we need to bring you back.

We have to bring you back and take some friends with you. You'll be supplied with anybody that you need, of course, but we need to bring you back.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, Houndmaster. And she just looks over and just, you, you, and you, please come with me. All bystanders just hanging out, just being roped into this.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Oh dear. Right away.

I love strange adventures. Bystanders that are all old people.

[Speaker 6]
A bunch of old ladies.

[Speaker 2]
You all seem like you are experienced. Come.

[Speaker 7]
Please.

[Speaker 3]
Quite experienced, Lydon. In many ways.

[Speaker 2]
I think Rana has met Edith before. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
We've been around for a while. Old zombie hunt. Excellent.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Actually, I think Edith is my first character.

[Speaker 2]
This should be good. Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god, are you glowing on me?

[Speaker 2]
Into the glowing portal, please.

[Speaker 1]
The portal collapses and takes anybody who was in there to Grodvok Thule.

[Speaker 3]
Some poor soul that has no idea what's going on comes with us.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there is, like, because there were bystanders.

[Speaker 2]
That was rude of me. Sorry. I am Rana.

Would you like to introduce your characters, please?

[Speaker 4]
I'm Deidre.

[Speaker 2]
Lovely to meet you.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, it's lovely to meet you too. Hestia Loveford.

[Speaker 3]
I love the name Hestia.

[Speaker 2]
What do your characters look like?

[Speaker 4]
She's a dragonborn that has moss and, like, tiny trees and plants growing out of her. Ooh, what colors?

[Speaker 2]
She does look experienced.

[Speaker 3]
What color dragonborn?

[Speaker 4]
She's white.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, she definitely looks like a crunchy hippie.

[Speaker 3]
Crunchy hippie? I love it.

[Speaker 5]
Crunchy.

[Speaker 3]
Those are fun people.

[Speaker 5]
My inspirations were Adelaide from Aristocats. That's the old lady that owns the cats.

[Speaker 7]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, what is her name? Oh, god. That one goth lady with the boobs?

[Speaker 3]
Elvira?

[Speaker 2]
I have seen a few of those in my time.

[Speaker 3]
Are you talking about Elvira? Elvira, yes. Got it.

[Speaker 5]
Elvira.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, THE goth lady.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, THE goth lady with the boobs. And then, just, I think that was my main two inspirations.

[Speaker 4]
Those were good instas.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think that there's enough old lady representation in fantasy and media. So, I think it's fun for an old person to be going on an adventure. That's why I made Edith.

[Speaker 2]
They're always portrayed as the old grown or the mystic. Not like the daring adventurer. That's cool.

[Speaker 5]
I like to think so. Also, grannies are hot, so.

[Speaker 4]
Is Vorana a melee character?

[Speaker 5]
Or is she a cleric? She is a...

[Speaker 2]
She's a cleric, but she... I really want to use her called Junic Dagger, so she will be probably... She can turn on her halo that gives undead disadvantage on attacks, so ideally she should be in melee combat.

[Speaker 4]
What is she?

[Speaker 2]
Human.

[Speaker 4]
She's a cleric halo.

[Speaker 2]
Just a regular human.

[Speaker 4]
She's an angel.

[Speaker 2]
Read some books, got her halo.

[Speaker 4]
She's a huge fucking nerd.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes she is. If anyone's going to um actually you, it's her.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any melee undead with us? Oh my god.

[Speaker 5]
No.

[Speaker 3]
What the fuck? That's what I asked, because I wanted to point out that...

[Speaker 5]
James wants us to do hirelings. Hestia would totally have hirelings.

[Speaker 3]
Do I even have money? Hold on, let me see if Edith has money for hirelings.

[Speaker 5]
I don't have money for hirelings.

[Speaker 3]
I have 1,500 gold, is that enough for a hireling?

[Speaker 4]
I have 440 gold, so that could be something.

[Speaker 3]
They're like 30 gold a month. Oh, well can I have gotten one?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's a bunch of them at the fucking keep.

[Speaker 3]
Take one that would be adorable to hang out with a grandma.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, do you want to take Jimmy and Arthur? The biggest, buffest guy. Oh, the biggest, buffest.

[Speaker 4]
Kind of two different things.

[Speaker 1]
Jimmy and Arthur will die.

[Speaker 2]
Jimmy, we can't piss off Jimmy's family.

[Speaker 1]
I love that you remembered it was Jimmy's family specifically, who has one of the big wizards in it.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, he has an evil wizard as his uncle. We absolutely cannot let him die.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no. We don't want to make a powerful enemy. While that's great for plot, it's not good for us.

[Speaker 1]
Take the two wardens along.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
The father and son who look the same age right now. Mermaid boy, yes.

[Speaker 3]
Mermaid boy and barnacle man. Wait, I think that's backwards. Is that backwards?

No, I think you're...

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's mermaid man and barnacle boy.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Barnacle boy is very funny, because barnacle in... Spongebob, I think, means fuck.

So, he's fuck boy.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, fuck boy. Anyways.

[Speaker 1]
So, I think that you could get away with... Yeah, while we have the wardens there, just... Just add a d8, basically, to whenever you hurt them.

You could have one of the wardens just add a d8 plus 4 to your attack.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, d8 plus 4.

[Speaker 1]
And they can circle, so you could place them in me, if you'd like.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, I'm just going to do a thing so I can see how that works. Would that be damage or attack?

[Speaker 1]
That would be damage.

[Speaker 3]
What am I doing? What am I adding? d8.

[Speaker 1]
d8 plus 4?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Plus... d4. Let's see if that works.

Did that work? Okay, I think that worked. Wonderful.

Okay, I just needed to make sure I could do it.

[Speaker 1]
Prepare a maximum spell level of 2, and they can prepare 3 of them. Alright, I have all the info I need to run these guys in the background. They'll prepare 3 spike growth seeds.

[Speaker 3]
We'll be fine.

[Speaker 1]
You guys might have a bad time. Alright. Okay, so, y'all are now inside Brodvok Thule.

There is the massive, massive crystalline bone chandelier hanging above you that provides light to the entire school. Which is built into the, not just sort of semi-inside the mountain, semi-inside the Underdark, but it's also carved out a little bit further below. And are basically built into the sides, whereas there's this massive gap from basically hollowed-out mountain.

Professor Tulkrua stands before you, the Dwarven Houndmaster. He's the one who trains Hellhounds and other undead animals, and specializes in the training of undead animals, or the recovery of undead animal creatures. Well, this is a little bit of a personal call, but it's also business for the school.

You recall the necromancer that you fought at one of the nearby towns? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Really, necromancers?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed, as we all are here, technically, or at least we study undeath. Some of us for, some of us against.

[Speaker 3]
Steering glare from Edith.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Well, you can be mad at me all you want, but luckily for you, Grana here is somewhat proficient at destroying undead and focused on it. Yes.

I see you've gotten a little helping hand from the Ashen Coil.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I'm actually not sure how this happened, but I'm actually sure what it does.

[Speaker 3]
The Ashen Coil?

[Speaker 1]
Looks to be familiar. The Ashen Coil is the psychopomphon god of, primary god of death, the human god of death. Oh, she's a witch.

[Speaker 2]
You can see, it's just a floating serpent, isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Basically, yep. Small representation of the floating serpent.

[Speaker 2]
The snake, it's wrapped around Rana's arm and it uncoils, and Edith gets a good look at it. It was a boon, I think, from the Ashen Coil, as I am also devoted to them. It is.

It should be handy, assuming the job that you have in mind for us, Houndmaster.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Indeed it will be. So, I come from a rather minor hold, far down to the south.

It's not too far away from Baroness Sierra's keep.

[Speaker 2]
But it has not been a better use of resources for you to come to us, then, Houndmaster?

[Speaker 1]
I actually wasn't entirely sure of the location. Not in this case. You see, the hold has been overrun.

Playground for this necromancer. Dwarves don't take well to raising, and it usually takes... If someone wants to use dwarf flesh for the creation of Undead, it usually results in a number of different abominations.

And just general unpleasantness overall. And while I'm not welcome in my former home, it's not exactly... I don't like to see it in such a state.

And in fact, I have some assets that I would like to be recovered. Officially, though, you are here because you have faced this necromancer before, at the very least his creations. And we have need of someone to dispatch and do a little clean-up within this hold.

See if we can establish a workload. We think so. There is an extraordinarily large necromantic presence there.

Something indicative of either extremely powerful Undead, or the necromancer himself. Which might be saying the same thing. Now, insofar as the assets...

[Speaker 3]
Give me some time to grab my notes.

[Speaker 1]
So, the reason we're not sending you to the front door is because that would be expected. And would likely result in some kind of ambush. However, I do have a teleportation circle inside one of my old homes.

[Speaker 4]
No, we won't see our notes. A teleportation circle inside the city?

[Speaker 1]
Unfortunately, the one that I need is a fair distance away. The home that I need you to go to is on one of the lower levels. There's an elevator nearby that can take you to it.

But I strongly encourage you to get there as quickly and as quietly as possible. But, officially, you are there to deal with one of the Undead present. I'm not sure if you remember the small girl who posed as a...

As a student here?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I do remember her quite well.

[Speaker 1]
All of our tags and divinations have indicated her presence there.

[Speaker 2]
Well, we must deal with this then. We can't let them remain.

[Speaker 3]
No, we cannot.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. But we can't let them use it as a locus for more power at the moment. I find myself concerned.

As far as the item that you are to retrieve from my particular residence... ...produces, it seems that our rogue student is somewhat nearby. It's a vase.

You'll find it inside of an English summoning circle. You are not to engage with the vase. And when you take it out of the circle...

Where do I put this? I don't know whether to... I don't quite know what to order you to do.

Do you know the spell Banishment?

[Speaker 3]
Can clerics move around their spells and stuff?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, awesome. I will have to figure out how to do that. Because I'm sure a cleric knows something like that, right?

[Speaker 5]
The clerics learn Banishment. I know Perrin has it.

[Speaker 1]
I prefer that you let them be banished. But if not, you could stick an effect of holding. Or you can...

It needs to be suppressed, in other words.

[Speaker 5]
Banishment is 4th level.

[Speaker 3]
Banishment is 4th level? Alright. Well, then I can certainly...

I need to change my damn spells anyway because I have a lot of...

[Speaker 2]
Actually, James, Banishment targets creatures. Would it work for this as well?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, as a matter of fact, it would work for this.

[Speaker 2]
Rana has the spell Good and Evil. Which also can banish a fiendish creature. So I assume it would work as well?

I can ping the spell. Indeed. Whoops, I changed the spell slot.

The second part of this is the dismissal.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent, that will work. The vase itself will remain. It's just that the presence within will be expelled from time.

[Speaker 2]
Good. Okay. I will take Banishment as well.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what I can get. Plutonium. Does it take into account that I am a cleric?

[Speaker 2]
It should. I don't have permission, but James could probably... Since we're both grave clerics, we should have identical spell lists.

[Speaker 7]
What would you like me to do?

[Speaker 2]
I think Edith would have the same spells. What spells were you thinking of taking? You should just be able to import them all.

Plutonium is probably easier.

[Speaker 3]
I'm trying to keep up with it. I'm used to D&D Beyond.

[Speaker 2]
Once you've got them all imported, I can remind you of what spells you should always have.

[Speaker 3]
I mostly have healing stuff.

[Speaker 1]
Give me just one moment. Sure. That'll give us a second.

[Speaker 3]
I might get rid of this spell. That's not going to help me here. So that's a third level that I need to grab.

You know what, we'll get rid of that too. No, maybe.

[Speaker 2]
I have too many 5th level spells prepared. Flamestrike is so good though. No, I'm going to focus on being...

I'll be a melee fighter. I'm going to unprepare Flamestrike. I'm going to take Poly Weapon.

Or maybe just keep... I'll keep that end spell evil and good because it's also melee. Control Water, probably not helpful.

Banishment is helpful. Freedom of Movement is helpful.

[Speaker 4]
Debuffs are going to be our friend, or anything that hinders them. I have lots of...

[Speaker 3]
I really don't have any attack things. I have a couple.

[Speaker 2]
Just Guiding Bolt is all you'll need.

[Speaker 4]
Just remember that almost everybody except for Bar went down. Bar had almost full health. And then Para had like 5 hit points left.

And the rest of us had gone down.

[Speaker 2]
That'll be fine.

[Speaker 4]
We also didn't go into strategizing. It was like a just get in, get out kind of thing. They did a lot of saves.

[Speaker 5]
They did both. But the saves were what was killing us. Bacon of Hope is great.

[Speaker 4]
Because I said there's this one creature where it's... You're so distracting.

[Speaker 5]
It was a lot of Constitution and... Wisdom? No.

I don't remember a lot of Wisdom. I think there was a couple Wisdom.

[Speaker 4]
But there is one beastie that you gotta cover its eyes or else you're constantly rolling.

[Speaker 5]
A bodak.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, they're bastards.

[Speaker 4]
There's lots of them in there. And then lots of critters and skeleton beasties.

[Speaker 5]
What's our sight kind of dealio?

[Speaker 2]
Rana's gonna have her halo up the entire time.

[Speaker 4]
I have dark vision of 60 feet.

[Speaker 3]
I don't have any... I don't have really any attack spells. Most of mine are just utility.

Should I throw in... Just take Guiding Vault.

[Speaker 2]
It's a first level spell. And it upcasts really well. It's 4d6 radiant damage.

It's a spell attack roll. And if you cast it at a higher level it's an extra d6.

[Speaker 5]
That's the one where I kept missing every single shot. Which was just my luck. I was casting it at my highest level spells.

It sucked.

[Speaker 4]
I took Entangle and Thunderwave and Earth Tremor and Ice Knife. I took a lot of area of effect.

[Speaker 2]
Holy Weapon's not good enough. How long does it last for actually? It's a bonus action.

It lasts for an hour? Holy shit. Okay.

Holy Weapon it is.

[Speaker 3]
How many second level spells is the Cleric supposed to have?

[Speaker 2]
You get to prepare spells equal to your Wisdom modifier and your level. I assume your Wisdom's either plus 4 or plus 5, hopefully.

[Speaker 4]
My Wisdom is plus... You're bringing Freedom of Movement, right?

[Speaker 7]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
So am I. Should we keep that?

[Speaker 2]
I'll drop it if you want to keep it.

[Speaker 4]
I don't care. If you find something you'd rather have than Freedom of Movement, go for it.

[Speaker 2]
It's just... Zombies typically... I have protection from poison.

I don't know how relevant that will be. Freedom of Movement stops paralyzing effects, which ghouls and things have.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. It might be good for both of us to have it, because if we are spread out we can touch.

[Speaker 2]
I'll keep it as well. It is a touch range spell.

[Speaker 4]
I do have Divination, but I don't think... Oh wait, never mind. I can't get rid of that.

[Speaker 2]
Stuck with that one.

[Speaker 4]
I am bringing the giant insect spell, so...

[Speaker 2]
That's so funny.

[Speaker 4]
There'll be big bugs fighting big bugs.

[Speaker 1]
Probably a really good idea.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of went through and prepared for it.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are going to... I think what we're going to do is we're going to have you clear out the initial home. I guess we can do that pretty quickly.

Then we'll take a short break. I'm still split on how I want to approach the movement of the city. I have a few different...

I'll pick one by the time that we've finished that. It will also give me an opportunity to have a snack, because I don't mind.

[Speaker 2]
Joe, was this house, sorry, the Handmaster's house at the vase?

[Speaker 1]
It's one of them. The vase is further down the city. This is the one that has a teleportation circle in it.

Sure. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
They're everywhere.

[Speaker 1]
There's a guildsman elevator that's quite nearby his official residence. That can be taken downwards. Basically into the slums.

Dwarves don't really have slums, I guess. Into the lower quarters, like the apprentice quarters and stuff like that. And then further below that into the mines.

They're just abandoned shacks. People kind of got cast off or couldn't find work. Or just decided that they weren't going to engage with dwarven society anymore.

And that's one of his, quote, homes. Is in there. And that's one with the vases.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not bringing banishment, by the way.

[Speaker 2]
I've got banishment and dispel evil and good.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, yeah. Alright, I'll be back.

[Speaker 2]
I will try to get Rana in the front line. I don't know how. I don't have anything to draw their aggro.

But if they attack her, she has a 20 AC and they should have disadvantage if they're near her.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, we'll just hide behind you. It's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. If they're approaching you, Rana's not particularly tanky in health. She only has 82.

[Speaker 4]
More than my 64.

[Speaker 2]
Her high AC and the radius should make up for it if we get surrounded. Coming into the halo bright light will give them disadvantage on attacking you as well. So, we just have to bunch up if we do get surrounded.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't think it was hard to aggro them. Pretty sure we just made a little bit of noise and they blocked. You cannot hit my face.

Stop it.

[Speaker 2]
James, with the Falchionic Dagger, I found the phrase that was included in it. It was in the chat flavor message. It says, for every point of damage dealt, you summon an equal number of spirits from the land.

Where do the spirits summon to? I can move them to anywhere within 60 feet. Do I just move them when I summon them?

Yep. Okay. Because if I have five spirits up, I can banish a creature.

I assume it's like a pentagram.

[Speaker 1]
That's the idea.

[Speaker 2]
That's really cool. If I'm using my dagger a lot, I can heal. That is the plan.

Buddy?

[Speaker 4]
What? Otter also has a lot of healing stuff, too.

[Speaker 5]
No, I don't.

[Speaker 4]
You said you had healing stuff.

[Speaker 5]
I have some, not a lot.

[Speaker 4]
Oh my gosh, okay, fine. I have two spell slots, girl. When I talked about healing, you got at me like you had all the healing.

[Speaker 1]
I'm just going to assume you guys are going to be throwing out Destroy Undead and the other stuff. The Turn Undead. I certainly hope that you two will move through this city a lot more frequently.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I can get my Destroy, my Turn Undeads and Destroy Undeads back in a short rest.

[Speaker 4]
Can I also swap in my healing spells?

[Speaker 2]
I have Masked Healing Word. I can swap that out for Masked Cure Wounds, if we'd rather me use my highest slot for that.

[Speaker 4]
Also buy some healing potions. I remember Para had 15, but she couldn't get to anybody to help them. That's great.

[Speaker 2]
I have one slot, one spell I can prepare. Spell Magic.

[Speaker 4]
Buy some healing potions.

[Speaker 2]
Prayer of Healing is very good out of combat healing, I'll stick with that. Protect Evil and Good. I don't think I need to bother.

I don't think I need to bother.

[Speaker 1]
It's probably going to pop up pretty frequently.

[Speaker 5]
I'm just picturing you using that alien motion detector thing.

[Speaker 2]
I really like the base cantrip of Detect Magic in Pathfinder. It's like, yes, there is magic. Next.

Alright, I can take Masked Healing Word and Masked Cure Wounds.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, currently I have... And Beacon Effect, which is a really good spell.

[Speaker 4]
No, baby noises. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I was muted.

[Speaker 2]
Enhanced ability for con saves. Yes, that's good.

[Speaker 3]
Bane, Bless, Cure Wounds, Detect Evil and Good, False Life, Sanctuary, Guiding Bolt, Gentle Repose, Lesser Restoration, Prayer of Healing, Brave Enfeeblement, Dispel Magic.

[Speaker 2]
You've got Dispel Magic?

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Sick. I'll un-prepare it.

[Speaker 3]
I have magic, so I should not have magic.

[Speaker 2]
Can we get an evening to prepare, James, so we can do our spell preparation for this?

[Speaker 3]
Yep. Sick. I do need a long rest as well.

[Speaker 5]
So I don't get to pick mine. I've got Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Witch Bolt, Darkness Shatter, Revivify, Thunderstep, and Sickening Radiance. But I only get two.

I have two slots.

[Speaker 2]
We can just force you to take a coffee break.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It's time for your short rest. Drink the coffee.

[Speaker 5]
But I have lots of cantrips, so...

[Speaker 2]
Altrich Blast, question mark? To go?

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Excellent.

[Speaker 3]
Who's your patron, if you don't mind asking?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know. James never told me.

[Speaker 2]
Be the Celestial?

[Speaker 5]
Celestial. Of course. And she is technically an aasimar.

Ooh, okay. That's pretty cool.

[Speaker 2]
The human's the one with the halo, not the aasimar.

[Speaker 3]
Do you know if you're a fey warlock? An archfey warlock? If he uses the big powerful fey in the world.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I think I know. I know Kyron has Oberon.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Yeah, I'm thinking about having Karis take a level in warlock and go from there.

[Speaker 2]
It's so easy to take a level in warlock too. You just sign the pact.

[Speaker 3]
Exactly. She's done it before. I have a feeling that I might be making her also a warlock.

[Speaker 2]
I am happy to frontline. Who is going to be our... Who can deal a massive damage attack?

Because the grave clerics both have Path to the Grave, which is double damage on the next attack.

[Speaker 5]
All of my spells are forced 4th level, so they're pretty big damage.

[Speaker 4]
I have a lot of elemental stuff.

[Speaker 2]
This would be good for things like fireball, once they're single damage.

[Speaker 4]
I have flaming sphere.

[Speaker 5]
That's more of a damage every time. I have magic missile, and it's always 5th level.

[Speaker 2]
Missile's also not good, because I think it would be only one of the missiles that deal a blow.

[Speaker 3]
I have Guardian of Faith and Spirit Guardian, so I can turn myself into a Beyblade.

[Speaker 4]
I have Thunderwave.

[Speaker 2]
It would need to be something singular and big damage.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, singular, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Like a flaming strike. Not like singular and target, just... We don't want damage over time, if we're going to time Path to the Grave.

We want, as I said, your fireballs, your single instances of damage that deal large amounts of damage.

[Speaker 5]
Sickening Radiance is centered on a point sphere. Oh, but it's over time as well.

[Speaker 3]
Do you know if Spirit Guardians...

[Speaker 5]
Shatter!

[Speaker 3]
If the appearance for Spirit Guardians... Because it says you can pick necrotic or radiant damage. What would the Ashen Coil be using?

Radiant or probably necrotic, right?

[Speaker 2]
It's up to you what you pick. The Ashen Coil could flavor necrotic damage as inflicting death upon people that need it. Or the Ashen Coil would also use radiant damage to call undead to the grave, for example.

You get to pick. Oh no, it's just based on... It's radiant if you're good.

Never mind.

[Speaker 3]
Well, she is good.

[Speaker 2]
It's based on the person. It's your will that shapes the damage type.

[Speaker 4]
What about Moonbeam?

[Speaker 2]
Moonbeam's good. Moonbeam's good. How high of a level can you cast it?

[Speaker 4]
Up to 4th.

[Speaker 2]
I think Moonbeam's D10 is equal to the level, right?

[Speaker 4]
What's Flamestrike? 2D10 and then you add a D10. I can put it in the chat.

No, I don't want to.

[Speaker 2]
Moonbeam's really good. I like Moonbeam. We can gear up the...

Because it does a high damage on the first one, and we can keep doing it every round. They take the Moonbeam damage.

[Speaker 4]
I also have Locate Object.

[Speaker 2]
That could be handy. It's good.

[Speaker 3]
I have a cool cantrip called Tuathan Tone.

[Speaker 4]
And it does lots of different things. What the fuck. I have Wither and Bloom, which is a 10-foot radius sphere.

Centered on a point.

[Speaker 5]
How much does it do? Let me put it in.

[Speaker 3]
That's cool.

[Speaker 2]
My only problem with that is it's necrotic damage, which typically isn't good against high on that.

[Speaker 4]
Then I will put it out for Locate Object.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I had a lot of...

[Speaker 3]
I had a lot of necrotic stuff that I had to switch out because it just won't work. I also have Enhance Ability.

[Speaker 2]
That's good. Enhance Ability is really good.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I figured that one would be good. I can bless you guys.

[Speaker 2]
James, am I able to quickly buy a Bag of Holding from the school? Would they have like a guild monster that I could do that from?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That would help explain why it's more expensive.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, sure. My carrying capacity is over because I have 6,000 gold. Now I have 4,000 in a Bag of Holding.

Still over carrying capacity.

[Speaker 4]
I also have Slate Storm, Erupting Earth, and Wind Wall.

[Speaker 2]
Situationally sounds useful. I think we're good. I think we're good to go.

[Speaker 4]
And then I have Elemental Bane.

[Speaker 2]
Worth making Bag of Holding character sheets, giving them 33.33 strength.

[Speaker 6]
Go ahead and... Oh boy. Are we up at the top here?

Oh. Oh, okay. Big map.

What's going on?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, what's this up here?

[Speaker 1]
This is where you're spawning. Cool.

[Speaker 3]
We're spawning in an interesting location. A house! What do I have on?

What the fuck? What's going on with me?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I would have known you were referring to Elvira if I had seen that token. That's beautiful. Both your tokens are beautiful.

[Speaker 3]
Ooh! Oh, that is awesome!

[Speaker 2]
Now... I guess when we're moving about the city we can stealth. I'm going to have my halo on going into this fight, though.

[Speaker 4]
I have a zero to dex, so... Yeah, my bones are a bit freaky.

[Speaker 3]
Why do you have a slashed out ear? I don't know, maybe...

[Speaker 5]
Um, deafened?

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what's...

[Speaker 7]
What?

[Speaker 3]
I have no idea. Yeah, she just asks what a lot.

[Speaker 1]
Definitely.

[Speaker 3]
We're keeping that. I want that kept.

[Speaker 1]
What's the best way to do an aura for your character?

[Speaker 2]
Is that a dynamic active effect thing that I should be looking at?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, but first we're going to do... Or convenient effects, I think is the one. Yeah, convenient effects.

You just create an effect. Do you have access to that?

[Speaker 2]
Actually, I think... I assume the map's lit up. I think my light radius should be fine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah. I didn't activate... I didn't activate the commission on this one.

Am I just for the sake of... Am I just for the sake of darkvision? Yeah, sorry guys, I'm fucked.

But in any case... Go ahead and repeat.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no. Aww. Eden, she's...

very disoriented after being teleported. No idea what's going on.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, do we know... if we're going to be going straight into combat with this fight? Not with this teleport.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
She would have her halo up still.

[Speaker 2]
Nothing bad has ever happened.

[Speaker 1]
No, never.

[Speaker 2]
Rana wouldn't even have her weapons drawn. She would trust his... opinion.

Opinion. Can I dump in the bag of holding? Short sword can go because she's using dagger.

Crossbow can go because... hand shirts.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, very first tomb dwarf is just going to take an attack at me. Dragonborn over here.

[Speaker 4]
I knew you were going to say that.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, uh...

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, not disadvantaged.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I love when fires...

[Speaker 2]
It's only disadvantaged if they're in melee combat with me, so you're fucked.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 5 piercing damage. That's its turn, and we come to danger.

[Speaker 7]
She's, um...

[Speaker 4]
I guess... Which one hit me?

[Speaker 1]
The one to your bottom, right?

[Speaker 2]
If you put them in the initiative tracker, you can see.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah. Okay, okay, there we go. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Edith got a 1 for initiative.

[Speaker 3]
She couldn't hear very well.

[Speaker 4]
I need to do a constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
A con save?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Let's hope.

[Speaker 1]
Damn it! This is a leveled spells only zone. Oh my god, what was that sound?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it'll be for now.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. What sound?

[Speaker 7]
Is it from me?

[Speaker 1]
Better go straight for the...

[Speaker 2]
He is in the aura now of my Halo-y.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 2]
It's a save, it doesn't matter. Well, no, he still has to attack. Oh.

Doesn't matter. I didn't get to cast it. Was that at me?

Oh, yes, you have me targeted. I make the save, so I just take the damage. I wish I was an Asima for resistance.

[Speaker 1]
I need a god to attack. Alright, that's his turn. We come now...

And two crossbows. Oh, just to run again.

[Speaker 2]
My AC would be too low on my shields not raised.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have it on your person?

[Speaker 2]
She keeps it on her back and she activates it with her bonus action because it's animated. She uses both her hands in casting and attacking. Two misses.

[Speaker 1]
These are going at Edith. Actually, no, the closer one, these are going to go at one of the wardens. No!

Mermaid boy! This... hits.

If it's enough to actually stick, it is not. It's fine.

[Speaker 3]
What happened?

[Speaker 1]
This one is going to do the same here. Hits. Damage.

Miss. It is not enough to make that stick. He is also fine.

That brings us to Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty, Rana will spend an action doing turn undead. All undead under a... They will be destroyed by this, I believe.

Yes. Are any of these under challenge rating 1?

[Speaker 1]
TR3... TR3, no.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. So that should hit everything, I believe. Yes.

Everything will need to make a wisdom save. It is pinged in chat. With her bonus action, she will activate her animated shield.

Raise her AC to 20.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus Christ. Alright, encounter is over. You guys will...

[Speaker 7]
Pick them off one at a time.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, more quickly.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we can just all hold our actions still. We all attack at once. Cook them one at a time.

How long does it last for? 1 minute. That is 10 rounds.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think they get extra saves.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think so. They do have to dodge if they can't run away, though.

[Speaker 1]
That is not going to help. These are all hit point adjusted for Chillness Valley, so 24 hit points. Okay, we should be fine then.

[Speaker 2]
Are we fine to use cantrips to kill them, or do we need to expend any resources?

[Speaker 1]
If you're attacking at the same time, you're fine. Especially given you have the two wardens there. They're both going to deal extra damage versus up edge.

[Speaker 2]
What can I do to get my 8 hit points back? 36.

[Speaker 1]
Good body fire.

[Speaker 2]
What do I get for not buying health potions?

[Speaker 4]
I have 4. Do you need one?

[Speaker 2]
I don't need one, but I would like to be full. I'm missing 6 health. Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

I think she's fine. She'll be ready now.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are in Art Deco House. The floors here are filled with red carpeting. It still seems a little dusty, but it's still quite bright in spite of that.

There's additionally red capes there. Draping all over a banner. It's a very simple banner that just has a skull with a dagger going through it.

It looks relatively uninspired, but it is still Art Deco, so it's all very flat and sharp angled. Or hard edges, I should say.

[Speaker 4]
Well, even with the zombies, this place is pretty nice.

[Speaker 7]
It is.

[Speaker 3]
I certainly could do without the zombies. They smell awful. Just dreadful.

[Speaker 5]
I think that's just what they do.

[Speaker 3]
What is this? Are these stairs or something? Yep.

Awesome.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I would assume. Do we want to check the doors before we go upstairs, or go upstairs and then...

[Speaker 3]
So, first of all, I think we should get oriented with where we are. I kind of want to do a thing where I figure out if there's any baddies in the area. Or how many there are.

Let me see. I think it's called Eyes of the Grave? Yeah, within 60 feet.

How big is 60 feet? Would that be up as well? Hold on, 60 is...

Yeah, that's plenty. We'll be in the house. I just need to know if there's any in the house that we're in.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, there's more undead in the house.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, let's see if I can see their locations.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, can you?

[Speaker 3]
Eyes of the Grave, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Any undead? Locations of any that isn't behind total cover.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm, okay, yeah. It is true.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I feel like we should just start opening doors. Oh, hitty. All together, or we each grab a door?

[Speaker 4]
My favorite is each grabbing a door. It's always a fun surprise.

[Speaker 3]
We each grab a door. We could invite in way too many. Way too many monsters into one place.

[Speaker 4]
So, I take it like these are hallways?

[Speaker 1]
So, uh, let me know.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, which way are we going then?

[Speaker 2]
Sorry James, I've forgotten what you said again. The Handmaster sent us to get a vase from a house that's not this house, right? Right.

There's a wedge here, just because it was convenient. Did we need to do anything here?

[Speaker 1]
You have a general instruction to kill as many undead as you can find. Of course. And we haven't really been given many more instructions beyond that.

Okay, easy.

[Speaker 2]
Now let's start clearing the house then.

[Speaker 4]
I have to get rid of all the coffins. I was waiting for you to say burn it down. It's too pretty to burn.

[Speaker 5]
Also, it's dwarven, so it's probably all stone. Not the best material for burning.

[Speaker 2]
Penny, I'm happy to start over here with you all.

[Speaker 5]
Alright. I think I'm gonna step back.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna ready a, um... I'm gonna ready a... What is it?

What's it called? A guiding bolt. I'm gonna ready a guiding bolt to shoot any zombies that I may see through the door.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna get my staff ready to whack him.

[Speaker 2]
The problem with readying a spell is that if you don't do the action, it wastes the spell slot.

[Speaker 4]
So I'm just gonna hit him with my staff.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you open the door and there is... This isn't quite a hallway so much as it is a balcony.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Well, then I'll just...

[Speaker 1]
It's in a mostly sheer cliff face. And there are two side rooms next to you. They kind of look like storage rooms.

But you can, from this vantage point, see out across the city. There are three major fires burning deeper into the core, more towards the back. With a blue and very unnatural flame.

Or unnatural hue, I should say.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that's certainly not good.

[Speaker 1]
The longer you stare, the more you can see imitation skulls or faces just kind of erupt out of the flame. And then get burned back into the rest of the fire. Leaving an impression in the air, like staring at the sun for a little bit too long.

[Speaker 2]
Can I roll history or religion on what these blue fires could mean? Sure. Religion, if that's okay?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, religion would be fine.

[Speaker 2]
22. Have I read about this sort of fire before?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, so this would have been... I fucking did.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know if I know that one.

[Speaker 1]
I reset my brain for a moment because I almost said Professor Severus Snape. And I realized it was going to come out of my head. And it immediately wiped out everything, every other thought I had.

[Speaker 7]
Lady. Stop it.

[Speaker 2]
Google Chrome has taken all of your brain RAM.

[Speaker 1]
So Professor Lemmy, Professor Sebastian Lemmy, instructed you on the art of... Or sorry, not on the art of creating soul fire, but on the art of quenching it. And his instructions were pretty simple to never even attempt to quench it.

But if you had to, if you were in some kind of emergency, it gave you a few different options. Soul fire comes from a conflagration that's caused by cursed fire. Something that's been cursed with necrotic magic.

And which a bunch of bodies have been piled into. Very handy for bodies that don't have any kind of use for actual corpses. Like they're too damaged or the corpses don't take well.

Because they're from, let's say, a species that doesn't take well to necromancy. For instance dwarves. And so you just pile the corpses on there.

Just burn them. Just burn them up. And begin summoning critters from the depths there.

It's not recommended. It's extremely dangerous. Because it usually involves dealing with fiends to even produce this.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, great.

[Speaker 6]
Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Fuck. I'm freezing fuck indeed.

[Speaker 6]
Rana just steps up to the cliff. Oh dear.

[Speaker 1]
Methods for quenching it are usually summoning a celestial and dumping it in.

[Speaker 3]
Don't we have one here?

[Speaker 1]
Wish magic is usually pretty good at dispersing it. And as a last resort, if you have a tremendous quantity of water, attempt to bless it at the moment that it's washing over the soul fire.

[Speaker 4]
I do have a bless spell. I do have create water. I just don't have it prepared.

[Speaker 6]
Rana would tell the party about the cursed soul fire and what it means and how to put it out.

[Speaker 2]
The fire is a problem.

[Speaker 6]
I'm also worried about how it got here. If there are fiends in this city then that is not good. Hmm.

For now we should finish clearing this building. Yes, one thing at a time. Exactly.

Surely. Yes, the bottom, the south door here. Monster and treasure.

Ooh.

[Speaker 2]
Entry. Rana will activate her shield before opening a door.

[Speaker 6]
That is a...

[Speaker 4]
That is a rule for this game. He didn't say interesting.

[Speaker 1]
He said hmm. Yes, because somebody made me feel self-conscious about it, okay?

[Speaker 7]
Like it.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks guys. Now James is going to put a lich in this room.

[Speaker 4]
Because interesting can mean anything. Big music. Please don't bite me.

Keating is so bad. It's so scary.

[Speaker 2]
Man, that guy has a tongue.

[Speaker 4]
He sure does.

[Speaker 1]
Somebody go ahead and roll me a d6. Shotgun.

[Speaker 7]
Got it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. The ghasts are going to go first. And we're just going to do a group initiative for this one.

Because it's going to go by really fucking fast. Sure.

[Speaker 2]
When they step up to the door they'll be in my aura. Disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck. Why does this guy have... Fuck.

The actual shit.

[Speaker 4]
You finished it?

[Speaker 2]
What the fuck? Oh my god.

[Speaker 7]
That's awful.

[Speaker 2]
Everybody turn away.

[Speaker 5]
I am reminded of that Maurice video and now I have to find it.

[Speaker 4]
DJ starts dancing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the ghast is going to make an athletics check versus the druid here. Jesus Christ.

[Speaker 4]
Aww. Do I have to do an athletics roll or can I just say that the... Can I spare myself the indignity?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's totally fine.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, cool, because I have a minus 2 to strength.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, I was wrong about the halo. It's just attacks against me.

[Speaker 3]
Just instantly, instinctually give up because you know you won't win.

[Speaker 1]
It's going to force you through the next door over.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Time to roll for Ruben. Time to roll again.

[Speaker 1]
I'm going to eat so much shit for telling Jeffro that you shouldn't do this in the middle of a game. I still believe that, but...

[Speaker 4]
I think with the right party, you're good.

[Speaker 1]
The ghast is going to push you into a treasure chest and shut you in and lock it. So that's his turn. A ghoul is going to go out here, kind of like follow along.

He's going to go out here. So Hestia and Rana, respectively. 13 hits.

13 hits. 13 also hits. Both of the wardens are going to add 9 damage to those rolls, so that's 17.

The one that Rana killed, so that one's dead.

[Speaker 2]
I need to get a token to keep track of the spirits.

[Speaker 1]
There you go. You're on the dead body pile.

[Speaker 5]
Would the one in front of Rana be the one dead and not the one in front of Hestia?

[Speaker 1]
No, because that was the one that made... That was the one that sucked in the attack of opportunity from you, moving out of Rana's reach. So in order to reach you to go over here, it had to leave Rana's reach.

So that's the one that got an attack of opportunity from Rana.

[Speaker 5]
Ah. Oh, okay, I see how it had to have worked, okay.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I assume an 11 does not hit. To who? To Hestia.

No, it does not. Oh, wait, that's disadvantage.

[Speaker 2]
Disadvantage against me, friendly.

[Speaker 1]
I pressed the wrong button. Oh, there we go, 7. Alright.

So 7 does not hit. That is their turns. You folks are up.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, well, this one right here, I'm gonna use Primal Savagery, just right off the bat. And I'm not hit. Do I have bonus actions?

Nothing useful. So that is me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. Alright, Rana, Edith, or Hadrian.

[Speaker 2]
I have a question. So the Caldunic Dagger summons spirits equal to the damage. Is it the one, or is it including my modifiers?

The dagger dealt 7 damage, does it summon 7 spirits?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think so.

[Speaker 2]
I would like to position them around the big guy then, and it says I get the option to banish a creature between 5 spirits, which would use those 5. Do they get a save against that? I'll ping the dagger again.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Would it be like I cast the spell banishment?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it would be like casting the spell banishment. Alright, Daedra and Edith.

[Speaker 3]
So there's just two left, right? Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And Daedra, you can roll something while Edith is rolling.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. I guess we'll just...

[Speaker 1]
Um, how much health does this guy seem like he would need?

[Speaker 3]
He does? I don't want to use any big spells yet, so I think I'm just going to go with the cantrip.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'm going to hit... Like 16 killed one of them, so... I'm going to hit this guy with my staff.

[Speaker 1]
This little punk. If you hit him, he dies. Alright, come on ladies, roll!

[Speaker 4]
I am trying to figure out how to roll my staff because it keeps wanting to use the magic instead of the attack.

[Speaker 1]
Inventory, staff to woman. Oh, I see what you mean.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Just roll a d20.

[Speaker 3]
I know what I'll do. I will... Hit him with a mace.

Yes.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, we won't hit him with a mace. Does a 16 hit? 16 hits.

Cool. And then we add the d8 plus 4, right?

[Speaker 1]
That was already done... Oh wait, no. Wait, no, yes, that was already done.

Okay. This round, basically. Okay.

They're both set up with bows right now, and they are very good shots.

[Speaker 4]
One! Woo!

[Speaker 1]
Did it.

[Speaker 4]
I did. It suffered one hit point.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, you only dealt one damage?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I did. Because it's only a d6, there's no like...

[Speaker 1]
You don't have a... You don't have a dexterity or strength modifier?

[Speaker 6]
No.

[Speaker 4]
I'm a spellcaster, I shouldn't be up here. I can try frostbite again.

[Speaker 1]
She has one hit point left, alright. You're both good to go.

[Speaker 4]
And then next turn, next turn...

[Speaker 1]
Ghoul's gonna try to attack...

[Speaker 4]
I can bonk him again.

[Speaker 1]
...one again. Sure. Miss.

Ghoul's gonna attempt to attack Edith. Does 15 hit at Edith?

[Speaker 3]
Probably... Let me check... Yes, it does.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you take... 6 slashing damage. And I need you to make me a con save.

[Speaker 3]
She curses really loudly. Con save, you said? Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, that was a good one.

[Speaker 2]
It's just there pinged in the chat. Click on it.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, okay, I can just do that.

[Speaker 1]
Very nice. Not paralyzed. Alright, the party is up.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna do it again. Huzzah. 19 hit, yeah?

Yeah. Huzzah, 6.

[Speaker 1]
5 damage. Alright, next.

[Speaker 2]
Both of them I will hit with Word of Radiance. They'll need to make a con save. Both fail.

I believe that kills the top one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that kills both of them.

[Speaker 4]
Pretend to hit it, so it looks like it came from my staff. Just for fun, not to claim it.

[Speaker 2]
Step in and make sure there's nothing hiding behind the corners. Cool. Both these rooms have treasure.

Fill out pockets with this dude's stuff.

[Speaker 4]
I'll look in this room, since I'm already here.

[Speaker 1]
250 gold pieces worth of coins in here. Along with a lot of parchment and just kind of mundane inks.

[Speaker 5]
Is there anything written on the parchments? Yes, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Does anybody speak Dwarvish?

[Speaker 5]
I do. I can speak any language, or read any language at least. Oh, that's cool.

[Speaker 1]
So there's a lot of orders in here about procuring parts. Procuring brains and canine corpses. Specifically, they were taking winter wolves from the nearby mountains.

And... There was some discussion in here. Somebody make an insight check.

Who is reading this?

[Speaker 3]
Probably you picked it up.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds like Hestia's one of the people reading it. He's speaking coyly about two items in particular. Or speaking about...

Every time he mentions a vase, he'll give it a pronoun, he'll give it he. Every time he refers to the vase, a person who's reading this.

[Speaker 3]
What is it about? What is he saying about the vase?

[Speaker 1]
It's stuff like... The vase was... The vase worked perfectly, he was very pleasant today.

He was very forgiving today. He gave me exactly what I needed. And it only cost a little bit of blood.

That's a bad relationship.

[Speaker 7]
Not mine.

[Speaker 2]
I don't believe you put pronouns in my game, James.

[Speaker 7]
You're ruining everything. 250 gold worth of treasure.

[Speaker 1]
I can't believe it has that gift in there. All of these are dated lore. 1049.

[Speaker 2]
Sure, that could mean nothing.

[Speaker 5]
A few years ago? But same month.

[Speaker 4]
What was in my treasure room?

[Speaker 1]
92.

[Speaker 2]
I reckon 92 is good, or like a saw trap.

[Speaker 1]
Check. Oh, it's on the treasure table. Oh, there was one other thing I needed to do.

So that actually will be... Somebody make me an investigation check for this room.

[Speaker 5]
How real. The one that Deidre's in?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. No, this will be for the one that the guests were in. Oh, I will roll.

[Speaker 2]
I rolled 10. Incredible. You're welcome.

Look at us go. I have plus F.

[Speaker 5]
What do Ley Dice do? Can they do anything?

[Speaker 2]
I have Scola Dice. Roll.

[Speaker 1]
This isn't for figuring out something, though. No, this is absolutely it.

[Speaker 4]
I have Miner's Dice. That's not going to help you. Roll a 2d8.

[Speaker 2]
18 for Rana. Do I investigate anything?

[Speaker 1]
As you're going through the quills, just kind of inspecting around, looking for any hidden clues or anything. Any of the cants that alchemists or certain flavors or traditions or wizards, but necromancers in particular, use. Just anything that you can make use of.

You'll notice that one of the quills is not in fact a quill. It is a wand.

[Speaker 2]
There's a magic wand here. Is anyone proficient with them?

[Speaker 4]
What do you have to be to be proficient with them? Arcana probably.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know what this does. That's the main problem.

[Speaker 3]
I have a plus 4 to Arcana. Same.

[Speaker 2]
Can we use Arcana to try and identify it, James? Or would that take the identify spell?

[Speaker 1]
You could use Arcana to get a good idea of it. I'll have a look.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, yeah. We can all do a little gander at it.

[Speaker 5]
We'll stare at this stick.

[Speaker 4]
I'm picturing the end scene of the Goonies where there's just a hand holding this stick and we're staring at it from above.

[Speaker 1]
You guys are doing a pretty good one. It looks like it has a bunch of arrows pointing on it and sort of weaving around the end of the little starburst.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, I'll try it.

[Speaker 2]
Be my guest. Ew!

[Speaker 4]
Be careful, darling. No, pish! Kish posh, no.

[Speaker 3]
You don't know what it does. Just be careful.

[Speaker 4]
That takes the fun out of anything. Cool. How do I get it?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you get rid of one. Oh, that's why. So you get rid of one charge and you fire off a magic missile.

That's what I would have guessed.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Just a wand of magic missile? It's a wand of magic missile.

[Speaker 4]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Plutonium import!

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I have just imported it to Rediscovered Islands. Nice. I'm going to need to refresh the permissions just in case.

[Speaker 4]
Don't. There it is.

[Speaker 1]
Budimus. And I will figure out a... I'll figure out a inventory management that just lets me mark an item as taken.

I've had so many bad experiences with the automation in these different modules that now I'm like, I don't want to touch this. I don't want to touch that.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, the sort of easy route would be to make a folder called Taken Items, and when someone takes an item, they are required to move it to that folder.

[Speaker 2]
We can do that. Can you do subfolders and folders in this?

[Speaker 5]
Oh, you can.

[Speaker 2]
You can do...

[Speaker 1]
the problem with subfolders is the...

[Speaker 2]
I guess we could just have a... yeah, move from Discovered to currently.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, like... yeah, you could just have your individual folder there that says My Loot, and then you could drag it in from one folder to the other.

[Speaker 2]
Anything like that would work.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that would work. Shit, that's a good idea. Thank you, guys.

[Speaker 5]
And I could help. Yeah, export the responsibility to the players, and then if they don't do it, then oh well, someone else took it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's like the players who haven't been adventuring in a while, their stuff is going to start getting auctioned off.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to make sure it all ends up in Mimosa's purse, just so I can really make that joke happen. Dump it all out one day.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, they have to... Soibatsu had to get rid of some stuff to... He had to work the corner to keep up with his living expenses.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, we still need to do Daydream's magic treasure ride. Yes, we do.

[Speaker 1]
I might just quickly grab a snack. Very simple.

[Speaker 4]
Am I allowed to create a... no, okay.

[Speaker 1]
It is 750 Electrum Pieces.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, sounds spicy.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 5]
That's the step above gold.

[Speaker 1]
No, it's... Step below gold. Sort of.

Step below gold. Yeah, it's worth half a gold piece each.

[Speaker 4]
What an odd form. It's rose gold, I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
That's right, platinum's above.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, Electrum. So how much was it?

[Speaker 1]
750?

[Speaker 4]
750 divided by us...

[Speaker 2]
We found 250 in the first room, we can divide 1000 by 4?

[Speaker 5]
Was that also Electrum?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Electrum.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, this is Electrum.

[Speaker 1]
My bad. You guys could always tally it up in... I'm going to tally it up in session reports to start off with.

That'd be great.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Yeah, let's do that. I don't want to do math right now.

Maybe we'll find more and then it won't end in a .5 in the division.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to BRB real quick, but I can hear, so... Okay.

[Speaker 1]
We've got the other two rooms. Well... We've got, actually...

[Speaker 4]
Did I take damage from being pushed into the room? I don't remember.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, you didn't get a chance to do that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's our next move.

[Speaker 1]
Hey, what are you folks doing?

[Speaker 3]
Well, we have doors over here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

[Speaker 3]
And we also have upstairs doors. Or, at least doors, not stairs.

[Speaker 4]
Well, let's clear out the bottom first.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm happy to do.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I don't like stairs.

[Speaker 4]
Get winded, dear.

[Speaker 3]
They're just awful. These bones aren't what they used to be.

[Speaker 2]
Piranha will activate her shield and open the door.

[Speaker 4]
I'll get my... One hit point staff ready.

[Speaker 1]
You came across another... Balcony.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'll get... I'll get my... My little guiding bolt ready.

[Speaker 4]
Ooh, more fire.

[Speaker 1]
Nothing in here. Oh, no, it's just the balcony. It goes off to a cheerful face.

On this way, you can actually see that there's a waterway pretty far down below you. There's a canal being fed by a spring inside the mountain.

[Speaker 3]
How bloody is it?

[Speaker 1]
Not at all, but there are corpses in it.

[Speaker 3]
Eyyy. And it not being bloody with corpses in it is concerning.

[Speaker 1]
Indeed. Undead usually don't.

[Speaker 3]
Should we take a listen to what's on the other side of the door before we open it this time? Is anybody good at perceiving things?

[Speaker 2]
Man, imagine if I had a 15 perception.

[Speaker 4]
I know. Nice!

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna listen through the door. You can move! I guess you would roll the...

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Room context.

[Speaker 4]
Holy crap! How big is your list? I guess 200.

[Speaker 1]
So, for a monster and treasure, you roll twice on the treasure chart, and then you add 10 to each result. It's actually 86 and 65.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's sniffing out what treasure's in there.

[Speaker 7]
If someone else would like to listen to this.

[Speaker 4]
Hi! I mean, I guess I can't. Feels like you got it.

[Speaker 2]
I just don't want to do everything. Someone else can listen while I do this one. It's really...

[Speaker 1]
So, when you press your ear up against the door, you don't hear anything, actually. It feels really, really cold.

[Speaker 4]
Is there a gap at the bottom of the door?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. This is dwarven stonecraft, so it's... No gaps.

You listen just a little bit longer, and you swear you hear the slightest bit of whimpering. Like somebody's just getting ready to cry.

[Speaker 2]
This is to the south, right? That's correct.

[Speaker 3]
What do you hear?

[Speaker 2]
There's someone in there. Step back, and I'll open this one.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Step back.

[Speaker 2]
Ah!

[Speaker 3]
Wonderful. Wonderful.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, ready? And Rana will give a countdown. Shield active.

AC's 20. Let's do it.

[Speaker 1]
One second. Are you guys getting ready to attack? When do you open the door?

[Speaker 3]
Um... Knowing that there's whimpering, Edith probably wouldn't. Thinking that there could be somebody trapped on the inside, in fear.

[Speaker 4]
I still got my staff ready.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's gonna be ready to attack. If there's something alive in here, then it's probably evil.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you guys find a human woman. Sorry, no, you find a dwarven woman. You find a dwarven woman who's kind of like slumped over and crying.

And her arms are just kind of hanging down. And floating like halfway out of her body, like one of those funny kids Halloween costumes, is a wraith.

[Speaker 3]
Is this a real person with a wraith coming out of her?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, kind of like just like halfway out.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, oh dear. Um, we need to help this person.

[Speaker 4]
That's quite the growth she's got.

[Speaker 1]
She kind of like raises her head. And the wraith on her back kind of like leans further back and slips further away, as she does.

[Speaker 2]
Have I ever heard about this before, James? I feel like this is a pretty lethal problem to have.

[Speaker 1]
Could I do a real- Yeah, can this woman survive? This woman can do nothing but survive.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that sucks.

[Speaker 2]
That's worse. A religion check for this one? Or a kano?

They're both the same number anyway.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I might do that as well, actually.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so this woman has been wraith-bound. Like fish that do that. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, like they get into the bigger fish and make it a zombie. Oh no. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Let's see here, so- Edith, you know that this is the product of wraith-binding. This is a spell. Typically, it's typically a spell that's used basically to keep somebody alive by tying their soul to something that's undead.

[Speaker 3]
Tying their soul to something that's undead.

[Speaker 1]
Pretty much. And it typically results in- After they're killed. On account of the wraith that sort of paired with them.

[Speaker 3]
So if we kill this thing, it's just going to pop up somewhere else?

[Speaker 1]
If it was successful. Then we need to kill it. And Rana, you notice this is the first time- None of the other creations of the necromancer that you've been engaging with so far have had anything to do with being corporeal undead.

Looking at it, this is just kind of studying it, meditating over it. In a split second, you're like, this doesn't quite look like he's standing. You guys are still deciding, so I'm going to roll another reaction check.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to just go ahead and Guiding Bolt.

[Speaker 1]
Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
Because this thing is not good. 19?

[Speaker 1]
19 hits. Everybody go ahead and roll initiative.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that would be plus a- What was it? I did plus because we have our little friend here with us.

[Speaker 1]
Another 28 plus.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know how she's rolling so high on time. 28 plus 4?

[Speaker 1]
I just rolled it.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 7]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, Edith, go ahead and roll for initiative.

[Speaker 4]
Initiative. Otter's still gone. No, I'm not.

Oh, well. Why didn't you roll your initiative?

[Speaker 5]
I thought I did.

[Speaker 3]
I'm at the bottom again.

[Speaker 2]
Hestia, go!

[Speaker 3]
She can't see we're here for shit, apparently.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, we'll start off with the... We're going to start off with the Keen Whale.

[Speaker 2]
Hestia's rolled, I am.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. Alright, Hestia's up first.

[Speaker 7]
Um, alright. How did that happen?

[Speaker 2]
We TPK'd a wraith. Runna can't go back. Staying dead out of shame.

[Speaker 5]
Um... I don't know if I have anything that would prevent something like that. Oh, boy.

Oh, boy.

[Speaker 2]
Do the classic Baldur's Gate strategy of just shutting the door.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, just close it. Does that work? Can we just close the door?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that'll block a lot of sound, right?

[Speaker 7]
Heavy.

[Speaker 4]
The door's very close. She's deafened, so she'll be fine.

[Speaker 3]
So, at least, um, how much damage is this going to be? Do you know?

[Speaker 2]
All of it. If we fail.

[Speaker 3]
So this will kill everyone?

[Speaker 2]
It'll put you to zero if you fail the save.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Hestia, what do we got for me?

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, I'm going to... God, what am I going to do? I'm gonna...

I think I'm gonna use a spell. Actually, hang on. Okay, I wouldn't be able to see his face.

I'm gonna cast Witch Bolt. I'm gonna step here. Actually, can I cast Witch Bolt from here, or would I have to be in the room with her?

[Speaker 2]
I think that's fine. Oh. Yeah, I think it's fine from the edge of your square to it.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, we're gonna Witch Bolt. Uh, 16?

[Speaker 1]
16 hits. Awesome.

[Speaker 2]
50 twelves. You can organize them to be 1, 2, 3, 4.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god. Alright, that brings us to the banshee. And...

Let me go ahead and...

[Speaker 2]
My save, I pinged it in advance. Please accept it.

[Speaker 1]
You succeed. Patrick succeeds. Hestia does not succeed.

[Speaker 3]
Hold on, I'm praying to my god for just a moment here.

[Speaker 5]
We don't happen to have an herbalist with us, do we?

[Speaker 3]
We do have an herbalist. We do, what do you need?

[Speaker 5]
Dice. 10.

[Speaker 3]
10? What do you need, dice? Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Like, 3 or 4?

[Speaker 3]
What do I roll? How can I help you?

[Speaker 1]
You roll d8s for Edith, because she's a cleric.

[Speaker 2]
If you roll, like, 4d8s. Do we just want to blow up?

[Speaker 3]
We'll do 2d8. Because I think that'll...

[Speaker 2]
I... I would recommend more.

[Speaker 1]
More? I mean... You need to roll...

You need 10s. I'm gonna give you a solid 30 seconds.

[Speaker 3]
There you go. Perfect.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not taking any chances.

[Speaker 1]
17 psychic damage. If you did roll 2, that would have failed.

[Speaker 3]
Roll 2? Oh wait, not roll 2. Psychic damage?

We all take psychic damage?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Making the save, we take 17.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Daedric. You're up.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Chad Dre for rolling a 20 on the save.

[Speaker 4]
I know. I'll use my handy dandy new wand of magic missiles.

[Speaker 1]
Respectable. Eh. No.

Keep in mind, those are only checks, not saving throws.

[Speaker 2]
Can I undo that? You can do it. Thank you.

What is it to shut the door? Object interaction?

[Speaker 1]
Object interaction, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I'm gonna step forward and shut the door.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
Step closer? I'm just gonna hit it with the... Awful.

How do I do that? It fails?

[Speaker 1]
12. Alright, high damage. Anything to do with your bonus action?

Uh... I'll cast Shield of Faith. Alright, you did.

[Speaker 3]
How bad does this bitch look in?

[Speaker 1]
There's a door in front of you. But she looks... When you open that door, you'll see that she's battered.

She's at about half.

[Speaker 3]
How is everybody else looking health-wise?

[Speaker 4]
You'd be better.

[Speaker 3]
What'd you say? I'm sorry. You'd be better.

Okay, um... I think just above half. Just above half.

I can't tell if I want to focus on... Wait, hold on, what's the... Estia, do you think you could finish this off if I was to focus on health?

Um... Because if not, I'm gonna Guiding Bolt.

[Speaker 5]
Go, go, go, go, go! Rana shut herself in there, so...

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna open the door. Like, how dare you shut the door on me? Um, and I'm gonna...

3rd level it. Please hit. For the love of god.

Okay, 22 definitely hits. Plus... Plus the...

The boys? Yeah, which is... I can do that.

Natural...

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he already did it. Keep rolling 9s. That's probably a good thing.

Alright, this is looking really bad.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, Estia hopefully can finish it off.

[Speaker 1]
I'm also going...

[Speaker 5]
Alright, um, if I remember correctly, I just hit now. Oh no, wait, you shut the door. Does that ruin my Witch Bolt?

Edith opened it again.

[Speaker 2]
Oh.

[Speaker 5]
I could say that I caught it.

[Speaker 3]
I caught the door like, hey, don't open it. Don't close it.

[Speaker 2]
Um... I wouldn't have shut the door if... I don't think I'd shut the door if it ruins your Witch Bolt.

Is that fine, James?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine. I mean, you would just have to go around to avoid doing the Radiance thing. Alright, Estia, what would you like to do?

[Speaker 5]
I would like to hit with my Witch Bolt again. I believe that's just the same damage, yeah?

[Speaker 2]
It's the 1st level version.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Is it just the 1 or is it all of them? It's just the initial damage. I'm so sorry.

[Speaker 2]
It gives you tons, yeah. The up cost only affects the initial damage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I mean, I only have one option for Spell Slots, so it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, now we have this lady again. Lady? Sure.

No, I'm gonna do it. I won't be stopped.

[Speaker 2]
This is why the door, I was gonna shut it. I should have shut it. Now I'm safe.

Sucks to suck if you fail.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, can I use my Rises, though?

[Speaker 1]
Who are you going to save?

[Speaker 3]
I'm saving myself. Unless this 1d8 doesn't work.

[Speaker 4]
Man, that's a nasty one. Okay, I did it.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm good. We're good.

[Speaker 1]
I'm good.

[Speaker 3]
You're not good. But I am.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, two of us. It has two non-drop to zero hit points. Edith and Rana both take 17.

That brings us to Dree. Go ahead and make me a death saving throw.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, it does.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, now to Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Bonus action, I'll cast Mass Healing Word. Because the two of you are on zero, I believe it does full.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, because you're in a section. Raid Cleric, that's correct.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, it doesn't mention... It says it's a bonus action, but it doesn't mention it in the text. It just says when I roll healing.

I'm going to cast my Healing Word. That would be upcast because of my book. Extra d4.

The people down would get 15 healing. And... There's a 15 for the unconscious people.

Edith and Rana get 11.

[Speaker 7]
There you go.

[Speaker 2]
With my action, I'll cast Word of Radiance again. Hand trip.

[Speaker 1]
That just barely does not... Well, I guess I have to. Death saving throw, which she will not succeed.

There we go. Alright, she is up with one hit point.

[Speaker 2]
I'm all done.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Edith. Edith, you can hear barking behind you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, alright, who's down? Who's down at the moment? We're good.

We're good? Okay, great.

[Speaker 5]
We're good. Low, but... Mhm.

[Speaker 3]
I should probably finish this first. Yeah, we have 15 hit points. I could mass heal, but I could also finish this thing off.

I'd say finish it off.

[Speaker 4]
It's really low.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, yeah, I'll do that. I'm going to attack it with... What is this?

Abjuration. I'll do the... I'm going to do this.

I think I understand it. The first one, abjuration.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and she has to do... She has to make a wisdom save, right? Um, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Wisdom saving throw, it doesn't... Does it save what the saving throw is?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, wisdom.

[Speaker 5]
Wisdom. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Are you spellcasting DC?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, my spellcasting DC is 15. Okay, so she takes 1d6 force damage, so...

[Speaker 1]
That should be 2d6 at your current level.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, 2d6. That should finish her off. And you said there's barking behind me?

[Speaker 1]
There is. Everybody can hear barking.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, boy.

[Speaker 1]
Um...

[Speaker 3]
This thing's dead, right? Are we still in combat? Is this thing going to attack us?

[Speaker 1]
You're out of combat.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, well, in that case, I'm going to immediately begin... Um, healing. At least try and heal everyone.

Oh, oh, not much. But, it's something. It's something.

It's good.

[Speaker 2]
You're old, Max. What?

[Speaker 3]
Oopsies.

[Speaker 2]
We clear this lost room, we can take a short break.

[Speaker 4]
Now, I am good at... If... If it's not a zombie.

I am good with animals.

[Speaker 2]
Do you want to take that chance?

[Speaker 4]
Well, no, but I don't see what choice we have.

[Speaker 3]
Didn't we hear stuff about, like, creepy-ass dogs?

[Speaker 4]
I don't remember. Did we? I mean, I assume they're going to be, like, zombie, freaky dogs.

Which, I mean, ideally, what we could do is we could, you know, just... Let it eat the siren.

[Speaker 2]
Well, actually... Before we do that...

[Speaker 3]
Open the door, throw the siren in there, and shut it.

[Speaker 2]
There was two treasure rolls for this room, I believe, James, right?

[Speaker 1]
Indeed.

[Speaker 2]
You...

[Speaker 1]
Might have.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome. But... Rana's probably read about...

[Speaker 1]
Yes, also the one up north.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's probably read about dogs that bark you to death. Fuck those guys. We...

Really should just try and blitz this next room, and then... Rest. If everyone else is fine with that.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Alright. Rana's gonna kick the door open.

[Speaker 7]
There it is.

[Speaker 2]
Do we get the element of surprise on these dogs, or are they ready?

[Speaker 1]
No, they're super fucking ready.

[Speaker 2]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 4]
Can I just... Oh, I only have it once.

[Speaker 2]
Can I step forward as the door opens, or is that... Too much for out-of-combat?

[Speaker 4]
Um... No, that's fine. Breath weapon.

I can... Just... Breathe cold fire at them.

[Speaker 2]
Honestly, just hit me with it. I'm not a monk or anything, but like... That's really good.

I just don't want them attacking you guys. Because Rana would, like, shove the door open and step in the doorway.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, everybody get in here.

[Speaker 4]
There he is, there he is.

[Speaker 3]
Let's see. Oops. Uh, yeah.

Sorry, I'm trying to... Get... Used to the...

Doing it the other way. Through the actual tracker instead of opening up everything.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Shield of Faith would have ended. I can do Word of Radiance.

Uh, no. I can't hit all of them. Just...

Can I stand in a half-square and... Hit two of them with this?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you'd have to push into the hellhound square. Uh...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, nevermind. I will... I'll just hit the closest one with it.

Like that.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Top, in the middle. Because if I kill him, then I can step to his place.

[Speaker 6]
Damage.

[Speaker 2]
16 damage, yep. Fortunately, the halo does work against fiends as well. So...

Bring it. This is where we find out they're blink hellhounds and they just teleport out.

[Speaker 4]
I wouldn't put it past this place, honestly.

[Speaker 1]
Just not updated? Uh... Oh, Rana, you never entered yourself into initiative.

Neither did Hestia.

[Speaker 5]
Um... Hestia did.

[Speaker 4]
I have 8 on mine and Rana has 15.

[Speaker 1]
There's two Hestias and Ranas in there. I'm going to refresh my thing. I thought something was getting fucky.

[Speaker 6]
I get two turns, this round's sick. Caleb is in. There he is.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, hell yeah. That's me.

[Speaker 1]
I wonder what Morgan's doing.

[Speaker 2]
Everyone's obsessed with me. It's just how it is.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Three.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I'm going to move and then I'm going to breathe on them.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, I did it.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know. Whatever it takes, I'm wherever it is to get that.

[Speaker 2]
It's perfect. How much damage are you hitting me for?

[Speaker 7]
Four.

[Speaker 4]
Fail. Shouldn't it be 3d6?

[Speaker 2]
It should be 3d6, so roll one more.

[Speaker 5]
Why didn't it do that? It probably doesn't auto up itself.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no. Woo! So I take two.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Others take five. Five whole cold damage.

[Speaker 2]
Rana lets out a whoo. It washes over her.

[Speaker 1]
Oh good, see we go. I think that dulls time. There we go.

Alright, middle one is almost dead.

[Speaker 4]
Can I pet that dog? Uh oh.

[Speaker 3]
Can I pet that dog? Yeah. I think about that daily.

[Speaker 1]
Me too. Come here stray dogs. Oh, you know what?

Uh, Drew, did you want to add? If you wanted to have one of the wardens add some damage here, you could kill it.

[Speaker 4]
Sure. 1d8 plus four.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there's no way for it to not roll that, so.

[Speaker 4]
Well, we'll see. I roll fantastically.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, now we come to this one, which is going to do... Refire. Ah.

[Speaker 2]
Once again, I should have shut the door. Rana's cooking. Everyone's cooking right now.

That area of effect looks so good.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I got this. I got this.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that's rough, I admit, but also...

[Speaker 2]
Success takes all?

[Speaker 4]
I think I'm down again. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's a success takes half. And the other one's going to do the same thing. So Rana can just make a second.

Rana can just make a second. By the way, you notice that these hellhounds are currently on chains? They are tied to a flametongue shortsword.

[Speaker 3]
They're undead, right?

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 2]
They're fiends, aren't they?

[Speaker 1]
They are fiends.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, alright, well I have no beef with them then. Other than them trying to kill us.

[Speaker 2]
I fucked up that arrow. I should just have turned that off. It hits both of them.

They can both do con saves and take this.

[Speaker 1]
Wait a second, I thought... Wait, what about Hestia and... Oh.

I see what you did.

[Speaker 5]
I will Sacred Flame one. Sacred Flame, Eldritch Blast. We'll do Eldritch Blast.

I'll be stereotypical. Why not? Oh, I have beams.

Beans? Beams! I have two beams.

Do I have to roll for each beam?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Nice. Just hits.

Alrighty. Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Actually, wait. Oh, I do have a healing bonus action.

Deidre, I can expend my Charisma modifier, which is 5, so I can give you 5d6 of healing. Oh, thank you. And that's with healing light.

[Speaker 6]
Woo! I gotta fix something.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, there we go. It should be back in. Zykara was logged in on Morgan for some reason.

Wait, how'd that happen?

[Speaker 4]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
A lot of the passwords are the same, so it's possible he said, like, oh, it just logged me in as that. It's like, you have to select your username. Anyways.

Alright, so that brings us to Edith. Which one's looking worse? The one looking worse is directly in front of Rana.

[Speaker 3]
Alright. How bad do both of them look?

[Speaker 1]
The second one is only taking damage once.

[Speaker 3]
I think Rana and our wonderful Dragonborn, who I do not know the name of. Deidre? Yes, Deidre.

I'm gonna heal you, because you need it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, thanks.

[Speaker 3]
And I'm gonna do that in hopes that you will help take this thing out. Because there's two of us, and I'm better at just healing.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, while you're rolling up the healing, I'm gonna go to Rana.

[Speaker 2]
Deidre, shut the door after me.

[Speaker 1]
Well, after you.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, after- oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
After you go, shut the door.

[Speaker 4]
Are you sure? Yes. Alright, it's not much.

It's- it's- it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
Nice, one of them's dead. And the other one is almost dead. Alright, Deidre.

[Speaker 2]
I guess we'll step up and- I only wanted the Hellhound's attack last round.

[Speaker 1]
Nope, both of them attacked. You did not take second damage for your, uh- Oh, did I not roll second damage?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that was nothing after the breath attack.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, let me- Alright, uh, Rana, go ahead and make me another attack save. Oh, if you use magic missile on this, it's toast.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's kind of what I figured.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it's worth it. It's what I worked for. For something you just got two seconds ago, that's doing work.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it's done for.

[Speaker 4]
Would you still like me to close the door?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, no, that was good. Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should rest. Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Well, if we're gonna rest, I'm gonna quickly do a cure wounds on who's the worst right now. Me, myself, and I. Oh, you're ba- okay.

I have nine hit points. Ooh, shit! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
We'll spend, uh, ten minutes casting Prayer of Healing. We're taking a short rest? Are we able to- Uh, looks like you guys are.

Sick. Um... My first Prayer of Healing gives us all 18 health.

The 5 and the 13.

[Speaker 3]
Should I do one as well?

[Speaker 6]
How are you all doing for health? Oh, I'm full.

[Speaker 5]
I still have a little bit of room.

[Speaker 6]
I think I'll spend, uh, the hour short resting after that. I might just spend some hit dice.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I might do that as well.

[Speaker 6]
Let's see...

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So in this room, you guys find a... Flametongue, Shortsword, and...

Ooh! Oh, there's- Okay, Pressuring Forts, there we go.

[Speaker 2]
Shortsword's not a simple weapon, is it? Heh. Thank you, Cleric Proficiency.

[Speaker 7]
Heh heh heh.

[Speaker 2]
Can any of us use a Shortsword? Uh, Druids can. Really?

Metal Shortsword?

[Speaker 4]
I can do more than one damage now!

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that or a Scimitar. It's a metal Shortsword though, isn't it?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that doesn't bother me, it's fine. Metal's in nature all the time!

[Speaker 2]
I didn't know that was the hang-up.

[Speaker 1]
Neat. Yeah, it's just the armor.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see, they don't like wearing it. They just removed that entirely from Pathfinder. It's metal is nature, you wanna correct?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, what kind of Shortsword is it? Can I explain?

[Speaker 1]
Flametongue. I'm gonna put it in...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Items, now. Pick H. We're gonna take one.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, cool. Sure. Oh, and now my kids woke up.

I gotta send back to sleep.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I can harness Divine Power before I rest to get back at Spellspot.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. The Flametongue Longs? Right?

[Speaker 7]
There we go.

[Speaker 1]
And then I'll just, uh, carry on through the game. Make sure he gets good.

[Speaker 2]
I'll be back in a moment. Am I alone here? Hello, hello, can anyone hear me?

Hello, hello? Thank you. I have made my Halo less repulsive to look at.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, this is my room, I forgot about that. History. Bitch!

Oh, before you grab a shower.

[Speaker 7]
That's right.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, isn't that right, buddy?

[Speaker 4]
I am back. Welcome back.

[Speaker 1]
Welcome. Pretty good timing.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh!

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, are we all here?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Alright, so the party's short-resting?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I feel like that'd be a good choice.

[Speaker 1]
I think it is.

[Speaker 2]
My Artisipha has 24 AC.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, shit. Can't wait for James to kill himself.

[Speaker 1]
Bro, my very first character had a 33 AC. I know exactly how to kill them. Because I gave my DM Matt a tutorial on how to do it.

[Speaker 2]
I'm missing an infusion.

[Speaker 1]
The only time I ever got hit by an attack was usually opportunity attacks, and it was pretty much always a crit. I'd be like, oh, these guys have like a plus six to hit? Fuck it, I can run between as many people as I want.

I'd take three natural 20s, which is the bottom 80,000 chance.

[Speaker 3]
20 automatically hit anything? I was like, oh, fuck. Fucking hell, this one, it was meant to be.

Doesn't one natural 20 hit automatically, though?

[Speaker 1]
It does, but it was three people. The thing I wasn't expecting was the feature where they did extra damage against people with more than half their health. I was like, oh, that's clever.

[Speaker 3]
You know, I hear a weird noise on my end. I am making something.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not going to read too far into it.

[Speaker 3]
It's medicine.

[Speaker 4]
Creature? Are you Frankenstein? No, I'm making medicine.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'm going to be doing that here in 20 minutes.

[Speaker 2]
Are you shooting the body piles just for XP purposes?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, pretty much.

[Speaker 2]
What happens to the hellhounds when they die? Do they go back to hell?

[Speaker 1]
The hellhounds do, in fact, go back to hell.

[Speaker 4]
Are they put in the dog house?

[Speaker 1]
They are currently. Their chains are still attached to this flamethrower.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's a problem. Are they like latched onto it or can I just like slide them off? They appear to be latched onto it.

Do we want to get them off of it?

[Speaker 1]
If you tune to it over the course of this short rest, it says that you can make them shorter or choose to make them shorter.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I can make the chains shorter. Are they attached to the dogs still?

[Speaker 7]
No, the dogs are gone.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, the dogs are gone. Okay. I thought they were still attached to the dead dogs.

[Speaker 7]
That's a problem.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I'll tune to it. I'll shorten up the chains.

[Speaker 2]
Imagine you go to, um, you like do the farmer's like rats in the basement quest and it's like, oh, here's my family sword. And it's still attached to like his father or something.

[Speaker 4]
It's a dead thing. We can't do much with it, but it's there. You don't eat these dudes.

It's kind of fun watching them pile up though.

[Speaker 3]
Verbally, I agree. I can't wait to play more of my little vampire character. Vampire looking one.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the frog, the frog was great.

[Speaker 1]
So, no, I still got you. All right. So you guys hear a you guys hear a sending spell.

But once again, one of Rana's lockets just kind of open up and a purple orb encompasses everybody. See that? Like, right, so, here's what we got.

Remember one of the lieutenants of this, of this necromancer I mentioned earlier? The schoolgirl.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, the weird spider girl.

[Speaker 1]
Right, right. She's coming to this house, it looks like. Now?

Oh, yeah, right about now.

[Speaker 3]
Should we just hide?

[Speaker 4]
We could just, like, hide. I'm sure she won't notice that we've been here.

[Speaker 2]
What do you think we should do, Houndmaster?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I'd fortify the area, quite frankly.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, is she bringing, she's going to wiggle her fingers, friends? Are we getting friends?

[Speaker 1]
Well, maybe, I'd assume so. I don't think that she'd come attack you with that backup.

[Speaker 3]
Well, I I suppose we should get ready.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, how are we going to do it?

[Speaker 3]
What if we stay right here? Like, we stay in these two rooms here? And so that way she has to come to this hallway.

And I can put a guardian in this hallway, and we can attack from these two rooms.

[Speaker 2]
I don't like the idea of getting cornered.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, okay, well, the worst could happen. It also sounds like we probably don't want to be fighting her.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, maybe not. Should we just, well, I mean Who is she again?

[Speaker 2]
A lieutenant? She Fiend, I suppose. I'm not actually sure on what she can do.

She, we've encountered her before, but A better question is, what is she? That I am not sure of either.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we can't fix the issue if we're dead. Maybe we should get out of here. Yeah, I think maybe we should get out of here.

[Speaker 4]
I think maybe we should leave. Balcony, balcony. Do these stairs go up or down?

Or is one up and one's down?

[Speaker 7]
What are the stairs?

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I assume we go down.

[Speaker 3]
I think we should go up.

[Speaker 4]
Up gets us away from her?

[Speaker 3]
Up has, probably has stuff in it that we're supposed to be getting, right? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I think we're just supposed to leave and like get to another house which has the thing we're supposed to be doing.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so it's probably not this one. Right, okay.

[Speaker 5]
But it's a dwarven hold, so the doors out could be up or down.

[Speaker 4]
Really? But no, but we're on a balcony. That doesn't mean anything in a- I know, that's why I didn't even finish the sentence.

We could, I'm totally joking, split the party. One could go down and one could go up.

[Speaker 3]
I think that's a fantastic idea. Splitting the party is always a great idea.

[Speaker 4]
We could also just like take a peek up and down the stairs, we don't have to, I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You guys have time, I'm going to give you about, I'll tell you what, I'll set up a timer here, I'm going to give you about 15 minutes.

[Speaker 7]
To decide?

[Speaker 1]
1927, that's whatever it is that you're doing, it will finish at.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, do we want to do like reconnaissance? I think we should. Did you have something to say, Ada?

[Speaker 5]
I was just going to say like, what if we just go up, like what is up and what is down? That's what I, yeah, but we'll go as a group.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, no splitting.

[Speaker 4]
As much faster as splitting the party would be, we'll go as a group. That's the smarter one. Sure.

Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Let's go up this area, where we are all crowded around.

[Speaker 4]
We're assuming that's up.

[Speaker 3]
We will find out shortly. Hopefully it's not up to wherever the heavens are. Do not feel like dying today.

That was good.

[Speaker 4]
Feel the earth move.

[Speaker 1]
How do you move yourselves into that room?

[Speaker 3]
Oh boy, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Finally. Jesus.

[Speaker 5]
Finally, I get a break.

[Speaker 1]
All right, so you're in what appears to be some kind of rather large torture chamber. Oh. What?

There are maidens here, there are racks, there's places for dipping hot people into hot wax, as opposed to dipping hot wax onto people.

[Speaker 4]
This is awful. Does it look- Does it look like it's been here the whole time, or is there like furniture underneath it like it was brought in?

[Speaker 1]
Oh no, it's been here the whole time.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Why would you torture someone to death? Death is sacred. Should not be painful like this.

Not if you can help it.

[Speaker 1]
The wardens right now are just chatting back and forth on like how best to prepare. Like, do you want to do spike growth? They're like, yeah, we'll do spike growth.

[Speaker 3]
Well, let's hear what the wardens have to say. What do they think we should do?

[Speaker 1]
Well, can you tell us anything about this lady? We know she's a lady, and she's undead presumably, but what does she usually do?

[Speaker 2]
I haven't seen her fight.

[Speaker 1]
You haven't seen her fight. Can you tell us any of the details about her? Like, does she fight as a schoolgirl, or like what?

[Speaker 2]
I doubt it. And out of character, I think we've seen her shapeshift her body. Have we?

[Speaker 3]
Oh great.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Rana has. You've seen her shapeshift into a swarm of vermin, basically.

[Speaker 2]
She can turn into vermin and things. It's almost like she is a ghost in that sense. Is there anything else on the top floor?

[Speaker 4]
Any other doors?

[Speaker 3]
Is there a purpose for this torture chamber? Like, is there anything to indicate why they would be torturing people?

[Speaker 2]
For the love of the game.

[Speaker 4]
Or... Just enjoy it. Whatever enemy these particular doors have.

[Speaker 1]
So nothing... It doesn't look like there's any... It's weird.

It doesn't look like there's any other exits.

[Speaker 5]
Right, back down.

[Speaker 4]
Should we do a perception to see if there's any hidden doors?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I think that would be an investigation, but you could do it.

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to do it real fast. We'll see. Nope!

Everything's fine! Oh, cool.

[Speaker 1]
The warden's going to help you out.

[Speaker 7]
What the...

[Speaker 1]
Two seconds.

[Speaker 7]
Hi!

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so... There's a place where you feel... You don't so much see the seams of this door as you see them a little bit.

Get out of here! It looks like a little bit of dried blood basically seeped out of it.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Oh. Well, this isn't pleasant, but I see some blood?

It looked as a torture room, dear. Okay. Yeah, that's fair.

But if you look at this particular blood, it's going under the wall.

[Speaker 7]
You're right.

[Speaker 3]
Does it appear to have any, like, mechanisms to open it, or...? Touch everything. Any oddly placed candles on the wall or anything?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you just start fucking around with it, then it'll take you probably about another... I'm going to advance this by five minutes, but... You now have four minutes left, but you do succeed in opening the door.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. What's behind the door?

[Speaker 1]
It is a...

[Speaker 2]
I see the warden's clip through the wall.

[Speaker 1]
T-posing all the way. It is a chute leading downwards.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, can you say... It's a chute where?

[Speaker 1]
Leading downwards. You actually can't see the bottom.

[Speaker 3]
Oh! Oh, that's fun! That's probably where they dump the bodies.

Hold on, that's probably... Oh! Maybe that's where there's a big source of bodies.

Down that chute.

[Speaker 7]
Oh dear.

[Speaker 3]
Does anyone have, like, a fire, a torch, or anything? We could just drop down there.

[Speaker 2]
I'll cast Light on a coin. On a... gold coin.

I only have... I have one silver. Let's go.

I'm going to cast the spell Light on my single silver coin and drop it down the chute, if that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
It goes down about 120 feet and appears to land in some water.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, water? Okay, so this is... Ew.

[Speaker 2]
Is the chute, like, a slide or a drop?

[Speaker 1]
It looks to be a drop. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Well? I don't have any rope we could tie together.

[Speaker 2]
We need to... Yep, moving. Do we really want to be down there when we're caught?

[Speaker 3]
Well, she would never suspect us going down there.

[Speaker 1]
We shut the door behind us, right?

[Speaker 3]
We're kind of cornered in this basement area. We need to skedaddle.

[Speaker 4]
Okie dokie, I've got 50 feet of rope. You want to ambush them in this room?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. It's been, what, like 15 minutes and we haven't... We haven't...

I don't think we've found anything that'll help us so far, have we?

[Speaker 7]
I don't think so either.

[Speaker 1]
You said it could turn into bugs, I don't know... We have found a torture room.

[Speaker 3]
We have...

[Speaker 4]
Grab and implement.

[Speaker 1]
What'd you say? Grab and wax?

[Speaker 4]
Implement.

[Speaker 1]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Grab a tool, grab a torture device, start whacking, I don't know.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the older of the two wardens is like, Alright, he goes over and he turns on the burners.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's what I was also going to say. Burners, they've got like, hot coals or some bullshit. You know she was on her way.

[Speaker 1]
You know?

[Speaker 2]
I found us a toilet.

[Speaker 3]
How'd they know?

[Speaker 1]
Presumably he's tracking her. There's divination spells you can cast on Undead specifically.

[Speaker 3]
Well, we have to kill her. Or at least... Try.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, before they get in, I'm going to cast...

[Speaker 2]
Casting Death Ward on myself.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, actually, that's a good idea.

[Speaker 3]
You know what, I'm not going to Death Ward myself. Who here wants my Death Ward?

[Speaker 4]
What does that mean?

[Speaker 3]
She's not trying to dodge death, she'll embrace it. But... Somebody else...

[Speaker 2]
Death Ward means if you go to zero hit points the first time, you go to one instead.

[Speaker 3]
I would like that please! Okay, you can have mine. I've gone down twice.

There you go.

[Speaker 5]
I think all of us have gone down twice.

[Speaker 3]
She passed you on the back. Did you go down twice?

[Speaker 5]
I think? I don't remember. I thought you only went down once.

I don't remember.

[Speaker 2]
I'll cast it on Hestia as well. Okay, anyway... Three of us.

That should be three of us with...

[Speaker 4]
I technically want it inside the door, but I wanted it right inside the door so the little area of effect is off. Presumably so they cannot see it until they open the door.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, um...

[Speaker 4]
I guess I would cast this right before they get to the door.

[Speaker 3]
Are there any corpses in here?

[Speaker 1]
No, none inside this place. Everybody make me... What's everybody's passive perception?

[Speaker 2]
25.

[Speaker 4]
Oh damn.

[Speaker 1]
Fine, okay. 14.

[Speaker 5]
13.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna check.

[Speaker 2]
You gotta have heightened perception living in a dorm.

[Speaker 3]
Damn. Ah, 14?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Rana, you hear a skittering sound.

[Speaker 2]
She's coming. Get ready. How far away does she sound?

Like, right outside the door? Do we have, like, one round before combat's about to begin, or...? Sounds like she's on the exterior of the building.

[Speaker 1]
Fuck! And she's, like, kind of going around and looking for entry points.

[Speaker 2]
Can we block the secret door up?

[Speaker 5]
I can shatter the ceiling.

[Speaker 4]
You can shove her in there. You can shatter the ceiling? Is that what you just said?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Shove her in there. Just shove her in the secret door and shut it as she plummets? And pull the handle so she can't open it?

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
What if we can lure her there?

[Speaker 5]
Bugs usually fly.

[Speaker 2]
Are there any windows or, like, a chimney or anything?

[Speaker 1]
No, this room is actually very well blocked. And it's dwarven stonecraft, so...

[Speaker 3]
What if we can barricade the door? Do we have anything to barricade the door?

[Speaker 1]
We're getting ready to puncture these wax tanks. You won't be seeing her. Well, if she's bugs, as you said.

[Speaker 4]
Can you move the wax tanks over here? One of them, at least?

[Speaker 1]
These are huge. They'll spread that far. Oh, you know what?

We can move something else in front of the door. They both get, like, lifted in the hall. Just put, like, an iron maiden right in front of the door.

[Speaker 2]
And I still hear her skittering about the building.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, this time it kind of sounds like she's in the other room.

[Speaker 2]
She's getting closer.

[Speaker 3]
Static illusion? Like, an illusion of some kind?

[Speaker 5]
I have darkness.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I was gonna try to make it an illusion over the door to make it just look like a regular wall with a painting or something. Heh.

[Speaker 2]
Hide the real door and then put a fake door, like, five foot down from it? Like, Wile E. Coyote style?

[Speaker 3]
She's probably too smart for that, unfortunately.

[Speaker 4]
Well, the little area in front of the door is difficult terrain for them, so that's something. And it does deal damage of some degree.

[Speaker 2]
I'm casting Shovel of Faith. I'm ready for...

[Speaker 3]
Well, hold on. Before we do anything, I do want to cast, um... One last fourth level, and I'm gonna do Guardian of Faith, because that's, like, uh...

I can put him over here, and he won't be affected by the difficulty for him because he doesn't move.

[Speaker 7]
Run!

[Speaker 3]
Oh!

[Speaker 7]
Oh!

[Speaker 1]
Are you in there?

[Speaker 2]
Piranha looks to the rest of you while we...

[Speaker 4]
She puts her finger to her lips.

[Speaker 1]
I've got something I think probably only you guys should have. What is it? It's a jar?

It's awfully chatty. Hmm.

[Speaker 2]
Why do you think we should have it?

[Speaker 1]
I just... You know, I've noticed something about my master here, is that he doesn't really like... He seems to have a...

How do I put this? He seems to have an issue when it comes to... Handling spirits?

And... I don't know, I'm just worried for him. I don't think that this thing has the best of intentions.

[Speaker 5]
May we incite? You may! Do we need to?

I can't incite. I thought that was mine!

[Speaker 4]
Oh, at least one of us got something.

[Speaker 2]
What vibe am I getting from this spooky girl? You think she's telling the truth. Oh.

Can we... Can we remove... I'll step out.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, fine!

[Speaker 4]
Don't drop my difficult terrain spell.

[Speaker 2]
Do I take damage walking through it?

[Speaker 4]
Can I... I would assume so.

[Speaker 3]
I have something that might be able to help you. I'm gonna sanctuary you. Is that a thing that I...

Yeah, I'm gonna sanctuary you as you step out.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think it's worth it.

[Speaker 3]
Is it worth it?

[Speaker 2]
She seems friendly. I'm gonna say hello. I can force my way through your entangle.

[Speaker 1]
You get sanctuary. Alright, so she's... Wait, nope, that's not it.

[Speaker 2]
It's only a strength save if you're in the area when you cast the spell. So I just struggle through the plants. I step through the door.

[Speaker 4]
I would've... I mean, unless you really... Unless you don't want me to, I can just drop it.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no. I thought I'd get trapped by it, but I can just force my way through it.

[Speaker 1]
That's fine. So the... Does this doll lead to this doll?

Or is it... Yep, it goes to the teleportation room that you guys are in. Sure.

There we go. So she's hanging out there. But she is holding the vase.

Oh.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for bringing this to me.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, of course. How's that dagger treating you right now?

[Speaker 2]
It's interesting.

[Speaker 1]
I like it. That's good. Yeah, he's still messing around here.

I'd be careful though. I don't think that... Let's see here.

Can you make me a wisdom save? Or no, an intelligence save.

[Speaker 2]
Intelligence? That's not as good.

[Speaker 1]
Twelve. You were here for this originally, weren't you?

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 1]
This vase. It's why you're here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, alright. I don't know if it's a good idea for you to have this either. Can we hear this?

Yeah, no, you can hear it through the door.

[Speaker 4]
What's in the vase, dearie? What's it about? It carries mines and everything.

[Speaker 1]
It's a pretty bad guy. I'll leave you with it, but you should probably... You should use some...

Ooh, here. The creature here produces an arm from beneath its cloak, made of cockroaches at the moment. It's like this decaying, dusty thing, like a mummified...

Petrified almost, with the head caved in. And produces a... what appears to be a fresh arm.

Like, here, go ahead and just make sure that it's in a circle of blood or something like that, just to keep it down for the moment.

[Speaker 4]
Is the arm fresh?

[Speaker 2]
Sure, I can do that.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I'm going to head out of here. I don't really want to stick around and see what he's doing. Or what he's up to.

We're going to let the combination leave.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you!

[Speaker 1]
What's she doing?

[Speaker 2]
It's good to see you again.

[Speaker 1]
You too! It kind of disappears and just flutters away. Disgusting cockroaches.

[Speaker 4]
Is that arm fresh? Did she give you a fresh arm?

[Speaker 1]
It's just bleeding at this moment.

[Speaker 4]
Ew.

[Speaker 2]
What do I feel? So... I have the vase and the arm, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. The circle of blood.

[Speaker 2]
The Houndmaster said to cast Banishment on the vase. The weird swarm lady said to put it in the circle. Kind of siding with Old Houndmaster on this one, if anyone has any complaints.

[Speaker 4]
Can we do both? Can we keep it in a circle and banish it?

[Speaker 2]
Probably. That would only banish the spirit inside.

[Speaker 4]
She suggested the circle to keep it in the circle, so it didn't get us.

[Speaker 3]
Trapton, what kind of vase is this? Is this specifically designed to hold...? It's ceramic.

[Speaker 1]
It looks to be... No, it's not ceramic. It looks to be tin or titanium or some alloy in between.

[Speaker 3]
Is it magic itself?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I mean, it would have to be. Hold something like that. Based on the descriptions we've received so far, it has a lot of motifs of snakes on it, except all the snakes are headless.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. I guess that's not really the Ashen Coil, is it?

[Speaker 4]
Maybe we do both.

[Speaker 2]
We'll start with the easier one. We can do the blood.

[Speaker 4]
Ready for this fucker?

[Speaker 2]
Rana is going to... trap the vase in some... blood.

Then she'll cast Banishment on it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so when you first... Alright, when you first put them in... Alright, when you first put the...

When you first put the... vase inside a circle of blood, you start hearing a voice come out of it. It's like, Alright, are you here to make an offering?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think so. Neither do I. Rana's going to finish the circle and try and banish the spirit.

[Speaker 1]
Come on, they'd get you a pretty good deal. You want money? I have money.

Alright, yeah. Looking for maybe a way to get rid of those problems?

[Speaker 2]
No. Rana paused for a moment.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
How long is this guy going to try and bargain with me before I can banish it?

[Speaker 4]
Alright, uh... What are you doing with this, by the way?

[Speaker 1]
Are you just putting it on the fucking... Are you just putting it on the stairs?

[Speaker 2]
I don't think you put it on the stairs. Not on the stairs, because it could tip and smash. Just on the ground.

I assume it's just like a small circle.

[Speaker 4]
Are you downstairs or in the torture room?

[Speaker 2]
No, maybe in the torture room. Actually, with everyone else. That would have made more sense.

I'll wade through the... the plant growth and... I assume I can just do it here.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Do the others hear me... hear the voice, or am I just talking to the pot in front of them?

[Speaker 4]
No, they hear it. Oh, I wouldn't have thought you were crazy anyway. I've talked to...

I've thought things with people before.

[Speaker 2]
Um, and I'll try and banish the creature. I lost 4th level.

[Speaker 4]
Like that.

[Speaker 1]
I'll look at the stats to figure out what's going on there. If I do need to look at the stats for something else. Yeah.

Yeah. Alright, so the creature is banished... from the vase.

[Speaker 7]
That's good.

[Speaker 4]
Is this a replay? Wow, that was easy.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, ooh, okay. That's a lot less cramped out here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 3]
And who's this magnificent beast?

[Speaker 2]
Can I roll a... Can I roll a religion check on Rakshasa?

[Speaker 7]
You can roll a religion check, sure. No.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what do I know about Rakshasas? One second. Banish it from the vase, I see.

They're pretty powerful spellcasters who are mostly immune to magic.

[Speaker 3]
We should probably try to make friends with this guy.

[Speaker 2]
They're also immune to evil creatures, I think. You might have to be good to damage them. Or is that an older edition thing?

I can't remember.

[Speaker 1]
No, no, I know what you're thinking. If it gets hurt by a creature... Oh, maybe they took that out.

I think they took that out in an update about alignment. Specifically, but... Yeah, so they are devils who took a...

Oh, you know what? Actually, we're going to completely avoid all of this. Sorry, a little bit of retconning.

He appears as a fellow in a suit and top hat, looking rather pallid. He looks like... what's his name?

Tommy Lee Jones?

[Speaker 4]
The fetus still thinks he's hot?

[Speaker 1]
That's right, Tom Pettis. What? Oh, alright.

My goodness. Y'all got any business with me in particular?

[Speaker 2]
I have performed the actions that were instructed by me. To me, sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, alright. Yeah, that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
You, how did you get in there?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think I'm allowed to tell you that for the terms of one of my contracts. Hmm.

[Speaker 3]
What a shame.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that sucks anyways. But, it is what it is. But speaking of contracts, I got a...

Well, it looks like I got an upcoming appointment. There's a fellow nearby who wants to talk to me. Oh?

What fellow? Yeah, yeah, he's not... he tends to bounce around pretty often.

He's been sending me messages back and forth, and he's been looking for me. By the moniker of Old Scratch. Somebody of my persuasion is a little bit sumptuous, a little bit...

A little bit hubristic, if you will, but... It is what it is. He's willing to bargain.

I'm willing to give him a little bit of power, and... So, we got an appointment in about an hour, it looks like. I thought I was going to be late.

[Speaker 2]
Since we've prayed you, can you take us there?

[Speaker 1]
Well, sure. Sure, yeah, why not. Good.

Are you... are you going to be fine with all the... The stuff going on outside, and...

Folks biting at you.

[Speaker 3]
Will... Will they succeed in biting at us?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, probably. I heard a whole mess of them out there.

[Speaker 3]
Well, with you with us, that shouldn't be too much of an issue, should it?

[Speaker 1]
What? No, they're not going to attack me, but...

[Speaker 3]
But you could help us. We are your... well...

Saviors, in a way.

[Speaker 1]
Well, what do you mean, help you?

[Speaker 3]
We'd still be in that bottle if it weren't for us.

[Speaker 1]
I can't save you from... I can only do offerings when I'm inside that vase.

[Speaker 3]
So you're telling me outside of this vase you have no combat skills?

[Speaker 1]
No, I'm just not going to fight through a horde of undead. I can cut them up a little bit if you want. A few zombies, but to my mind, you're just going to get overrun anyways.

There's nastier things than zombies out there.

[Speaker 2]
Can you get your meeting to happen here?

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and make me, like, a persuasion check.

[Speaker 7]
Disadvantage. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, hang on. Can I actually rephrase it? Because I remembered that my Aloy gives me advantage on intimidation.

[Speaker 4]
Can I enhance ability?

[Speaker 1]
Sure.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, what was the check that you need to make?

[Speaker 7]
Intimidation.

[Speaker 2]
Charisma. So, Charisma.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay, that's all I can give you then. That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, let me rephrase that. If you don't help us, I'm going to send you back to the infernal pit that you've come from.

[Speaker 4]
Oooh. I like it.

[Speaker 2]
One of my few skills with the plus there. That did not roll with advantage, I'm just going to roll a second one.

[Speaker 1]
Oh!

[Speaker 2]
That's so good.

[Speaker 1]
You know what, let me talk to the boss.

[Speaker 2]
Good.

[Speaker 1]
Well, not the boss, but like, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Rana's eyes glow with like a heavenly light as her Halo shines on this thing.

[Speaker 1]
I need to consider some logistics here for a moment. Is 1130 where I am? Do you need to go to sleep, suit?

[Speaker 2]
We can pick this up another time if that would be easiest.

[Speaker 1]
I'm trying to think. Are there any games going on tomorrow?

[Speaker 2]
I'm okay to hang out tomorrow.

[Speaker 3]
I don't think I am. I think I'm having like a friendsgiving type thing.

[Speaker 2]
Ah.

[Speaker 1]
What about Sunday? The problem is our Sunday is Landy's Monday.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'd be out for that one. Unless it was like, after work. But I think that's, by that point, your Monday as well, so.

[Speaker 1]
No, my Monday's pretty, wait no, no it's not. Nevermind. I got a, uh, it's Wednesday that I don't have a, it's Wednesday that I have a short morning shift.

And I won't have a, I normally have an evening shift as well, but I won't this Wednesday. I'm just doing Black Friday for a full shift. What's wrong?

Oh, you know what, Mr. Cherry's gonna say like, ooh, um, why don't we pick this up. I don't want you to go anywhere. I want to make sure I had your full attention.

Uh, why don't we pick this up whenever you feel like you could get back to me, alright?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, how would we contact you?

[Speaker 1]
Huh, that'd be pretty simple. Whenever you find yourself, uh, looking at me.

[Speaker 2]
What kind of character is this man about to plain shift us?

[Speaker 1]
No, he's just gonna snap his fingers and, uh, he's going to engage a little bit of pause time for us. The next time we come back, uh, we're just gonna come back at this moment. Awesome.

Whenever that is.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we're all stuck in a time bubble again. Those pesky time bubbles are everywhere.

[Speaker 3]
Respect time like they used to. Nope.

[Speaker 4]
Walking by a day.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, cause next week is Thanksgiving too. I don't know if anyone actually... Nessie's family cares.

That's the only one I know.

[Speaker 3]
I wouldn't really celebrate it that much, cause it's... I don't love holidays anyway. There's kind of just too much hassle.

[Speaker 1]
No, I agree.

[Speaker 3]
Um, but, uh, I have friends who, um, want to get together for it. That's really the only reason why I'm celebrating it.

[Speaker 1]
I could... we could have somebody control your character tomorrow? I don't want you to miss out on it.

I also don't want you to miss out on it.

[Speaker 3]
Just make sure Edith doesn't die, um...

[Speaker 2]
Mechanically, Edith is very similar to Rana, so...

[Speaker 3]
If she does die, oh well, but just try not to.

[Speaker 2]
It's for the greater good if it happens.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, she wouldn't mind. I would mind, but she wouldn't. We'll try.

We'll keep her alive.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, please watch, Bluey. Quit getting into my stuff. You're so handy.

Stop it.

[Speaker 5]
So are we planning on meeting up tomorrow?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we're gonna meet up tomorrow.

[Speaker 2]
I'm happy to do... anytime.

[Speaker 3]
Depending on the time, I might be able to join.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, shit. Saturday. Um, hang on.

I work, um, during the day. So let me put out the time that I would be home. Because I forgot that I work tomorrow.

I'm gonna put it in voiceover flow. That would be when I would be home. I think it's an hour later than we started today.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Yeah, I'd be fine with that.

[Speaker 3]
We might be able to join then. Cool. If not, just start without me, but I...

if it's at night time...

[Speaker 1]
Some of these guys are really difficult for me to stand out, but, um... I've found a few where you've been able to work nicely for me over the past week, so... Especially because I've been working on this side thread in particular, so it's gonna be really funny if it comes to its conclusion tomorrow.

[Speaker 2]
I'm happy to do that time tomorrow.

[Speaker 7]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to visit my mother, but that's at 2pm for me, so I'll be back. Well and truly. Uh, I don't think I heard you, Plastic Chair.

[Speaker 3]
No, you're muted. Unmute yourself. Yes.

[Speaker 7]
I love you. Hey.

[Speaker 1]
So the item... you guys found two magic items. That is somewhat uncommon for Appendix 8 to deliver in like four weeks.

[Speaker 4]
I got both of them.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so it was a total of... not a ton of gold, so 500 gold pieces. And then...

200 platinum pieces. We have a flametongue. There we go.

[Speaker 5]
Alright, and then there was four of us?

[Speaker 1]
Mhmm.

[Speaker 5]
Do we want to give the rangers some?

[Speaker 1]
Uh... No, they don't get a share of the... They get like paid, and you could give them extra stuff and they'll be happy about it, but like uh...

[Speaker 7]
Food.

[Speaker 1]
Electrum. They're having a fucking blast, by the way. They're just like, ah, this is...

it's been so fucking long since we've done anything like this.

[Speaker 4]
Well I'm glad they're having fun.

[Speaker 1]
Little bit of monster hunting. Alright.

[Speaker 2]
I believe it.

[Speaker 1]
I was like, wait a minute, they're shape-changing.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Well she can, but she loses all the benefits of the Book of Exalted Deeds.

[Speaker 7]
And I really don't want to lose that.

[Speaker 2]
Literally I've been deducting like 10 gold from my character sheet per week because I have to do a good deed every week, and she's been donating to like, I don't know, orphans or something?

[Speaker 7]
That's amazing. He wants some extra money, he wants some extra money to help you donate to orphans.

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty good on my orphan funds, thank you.

[Speaker 4]
No, very good.

[Speaker 1]
Very good.

[Speaker 7]
What?

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna figure it out. Let's post another one, and then if we do play tomorrow then we don't have to worry about all this time at all.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because we actually slept a day, didn't we? So tomorrow would be today.

[Speaker 1]
Tomorrow would be the 4th, and you guys...

[Speaker 5]
We're on the 6th.

[Speaker 1]
Ah.

[Speaker 5]
I'll just call in sick to work.

[Speaker 2]
I have like over 100 hours of sick leave.

[Speaker 1]
Edit.

[Speaker 2]
Fucking Rakshasa, their backward hands, ah, I hate those guys. You can see it in the picture, their hands are backwards. They are backwards.

Rakshasas are so cool, I miss their like evil thing or whatever it was.

[Speaker 1]
So what would happen is if you were of a good alignment and you smacked them with piercing damage, you dealt... They were vulnerable. Actually, maybe that's where it is.

Vulnerabilities, yeah, piercing from magic weapons wielded by good creatures.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, it is just there still?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it is there. I was looking in the wrong place.

[Speaker 2]
Why is it, um, piercing? I don't know, it is.

[Speaker 1]
Who fucking knows?

[Speaker 5]
Because they're secretly evil balloons.

[Speaker 1]
They're balloons made of eels.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I found my phone, that's so sweet. Thanks, no, don't run away with it, thank you.

[Speaker 2]
In my friend's campaign, they were trying to open like a gate to hell, typical D&D stuff. And one devil escaped and it was a fucking Rakshasa. So there's just a Rakshasa living in the wild somewhere now and it pisses me off.

This will never find it unless it reveals itself. Because they're crafty bastards.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, where did this happen?

[Speaker 2]
In my friend's campaign that he was running. They were trying to open a gate to hell and the only devil that escaped was a Rakshasa. Like, at least we could fight like a dumb devil.

Like a bone devil's not gonna blend in. This fucker, who knows where he is.

[Speaker 3]
That much more satisfying when you do put him back in hell, really.

[Speaker 2]
We're never gonna find him, though. What's it called?

[Speaker 3]
Always a lid, you just gotta find it.

[Speaker 2]
Does anybody here want some baked goodies from Vek'ara?

[Speaker 4]
Not right now.

[Speaker 2]
Mostly my characters are all pretty kitted out. Yeah, we're busy in the underdog, question mark? Or just a dwarven hold?

[Speaker 1]
It's a dwarven hold, it does go deep.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so it's deep in a mountain, but it's not the well below.

[Speaker 1]
This guy's getting big too greeper. Too greep, uh, too deep.

[Speaker 3]
Greedily. They were just tricked. Um, I have a question about a character, um, of mine.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Um, I didn't ever pick a magic item for, uh, what's his name, Susudio. Um, can I get like a beak with dead something?

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, yeah. That'd be pretty fun. Just a lantern that gives you, like, speak with dead or something?

[Speaker 3]
Like, the only reason he wants to speak with the dead is to ask them about how they died.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, you have a lantern that can be used for speak with dead.

[Speaker 3]
Ayy, nice.

[Speaker 1]
Can't think of any.

[Speaker 3]
Where can I find that? Is that in plutonium?

[Speaker 1]
I just invented it two seconds ago. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um, where do you put- Where do we put down things that we have purchased?

[Speaker 1]
In your character sheet.

[Speaker 2]
Like, do I literally just write it down somewhere?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, if you just- In the inventory, deduct your gold and- You could put that quest- Uh, go ahead and put that question inside your thread. And then I'll answer that when I wake up. Or sometime after that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, no. I already know what you mean.

[Speaker 3]
Chance, um- Mr. Cherry's face. Write out the thing that you invented two seconds ago.

[Speaker 1]
I'll also do that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just say- Why would the hound monster tell me to free the devil?

[Speaker 4]
Why is he reading evil? Or he just likes a prank.

[Speaker 3]
I- Edith is not happy about the events that have just unfolded.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe she's like, LOL April Fool's.

[Speaker 2]
I think dealing with the devil is inherently evil. Not necessarily.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I guess- Are all devils evil? Because I'm sure there's some that aren't evil evil.

[Speaker 2]
No, they are.

[Speaker 3]
No? Okay, I don't know much about devils.

[Speaker 2]
Devils are typically lawful evil. They might be more lawful than they are evil. But they're still evil, by definition.

Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Bastards.

[Speaker 2]
I know in the Forgotten Realms, Asmodeus was an angel who got tired of playing by the angels' rules, and he became a fallen angel because he was happy to act lawfully but inflict evil upon his enemies.

[Speaker 3]
Honestly, I don't blame him.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Isn't that kind of similar with Zarya? I think she's a fallen angel. Probably.

[Speaker 1]
How many gods are in this town? Oh, that's right. Astrohawk is a frog in fuzz.

Yes.

[Speaker 3]
That's my, uh- I changed my name on here. I changed my nickname on here. Astrohawk is my gamer tag.

Or at least it was before my frog stuff. Before I was Frog of the Christy.

[Speaker 4]
That's an amazing name, by the way. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Speak with dead. Five times per day.

[Speaker 5]
Big maul. Fuck, what's a maul?

[Speaker 3]
It's a- It's a mace hammer, I think.

[Speaker 5]
I looked up maul and the first thing is Darth Maul. Of course.

[Speaker 3]
A maul is like a really big mace. Yeah, it's like a hammer mace.

[Speaker 2]
Really cool.

[Speaker 3]
You think if you got, like, a mace, Um...

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, macing.

[Speaker 3]
A mace with, like, blades on the side that you can just, like, replace every once in a while.

[Speaker 1]
That would remind me of, uh, that would remind me of, like, a like an axe or something.

[Speaker 3]
It's just got little blades on it where a mace kind of juts out in different areas.

[Speaker 1]
No, like a flange- They call that a flanged mace, I think. Flanged? F-L-A-N-G-E.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
How long did it take to negotiate and release the uh, Infernal Man? Because I cast, um, I cast Feint, not Feint. The one health spell that lasts for eight hours.

Uh, Death Ward. Do we need to be counting time for that? It lasts eight hours and the next time we put to zero it's one infernal.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Basically it'll take them it took the other thing an hour to get to you, it'll take Old Scratch an hour to get to you as well. As well as his companion. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Ready, you guys? I gotta go make some desserts for tomorrow's Thanksgiving event.

[Speaker 1]
Have fun with that. Have fun. Alright, it's in your thread.

[Speaker 3]
Alrighty, thank you!

[Speaker 6]
Bye!

[Speaker 1]
Bye! Alright, sweet. Alright, now I'm actually gonna...

[Speaker 4]
Alright, let go. Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Actually, you know what? Oh, I have to work at eight. Oh, I'm probably gonna get up to nine in a minute.

Alright. Alright, well I'll talk to you guys later. Sure.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks for running.

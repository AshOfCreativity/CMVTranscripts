[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Awesome. Okay. See.

Do do do do. Down to actions. Hmm.

Vain contact. Vain contact is something I could do. All right, I'm here.

Hi. Hello. Okay, um.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I, uh, she said if she's on an, if we're on it in like an hour, I'm, I am willing to wait.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
If we want to do that. Okay. Ah, okay.

All right, well, we could do a short game then. Right now. Game.

Wait. How does that work? Where is gain contact?

Ah. Go. Okay.

Foundry's gotta load in first. Um, what do you mean by downtime? Okay, so downtime.

What am I doing with downtime? Is that in Foundry or in Discord? Okay, you're gonna have to walk me through that.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh, okay, the downtime bot. Got it. Um, well, I did one downtime, which was the...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay, uh, what do I do? Secret? Uh, okay.

Um. Just overflow. Is this gonna fuck up my progress in downtime?

Uh, nothing. Hold on. Time bot.

So specific action will be like... Would that be gain contact? Scout location?

All right, well, so what was the outcome of the first one? Oh, beautiful. Okay, so I can bring Karis or Siren.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
All right, oh god, they're both perfect for this, but I think I'll go with Siren. For the date, do I just put today's actual date or in-game date?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay. Scouting the location. Okay.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
It says there's one more thing, but it won't show me what that one more thing is, so... Oh, it's roles? Okay, all right.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I don't know what to do with that. Alexa, stop. I'm just gonna...

Hey, good guy.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
All I did was look at the dog that I'm pet-sitting for, and he started barking. All right, slash downtime. It's a studio.

Action category, I guess that would also be secret for the second one.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
The second one would also be secret. So I did scout location.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I don't know what else to do. So I found the location, I scouted the location.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I guess I could do gain contact? I don't know. Gain contact.

Hey, we can have double contact. Awesome. Date range...

Two weeks ago? Okay. There we go.

So I did...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Scout location, which is going to be a...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
D.C. Perception, Society, or Stealth. Perception... We'll go with Stealth.

Yeah, we'll go with Stealth. Then I gained contact, hopefully. Diplomacy or Society, oh good lord.

It's not horrible.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
All right. I got a 20 on my Stealth and a 15 on my Diplomacy.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
That was for scout location, yes. 23. Why is...

Let's see. What's in the basement? Do we know?

Okay. I'm going to bring Siren and...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Susudio. As well as... Joran?

I don't know what his name is.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
My bird dude. I won't add Joran. There we go.

So how do hirelings work in this? Just... Type it in.

Okay. All right.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I'm going to give him 173 silver to cover however fucking long that is.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
How do I use them in combat? Can they just go on my turn, or do they have to have an initiative roll? Would we use that via contact?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yes.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Sure. Siren's been here before.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Wait, what you said? Oh, Splendid.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I love how that happened.

[Manaia (Heart)]
All right.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Well. Where's the object? Do I know its exact location?

I can't see anything without a token.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Ah, now I can see.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Hello, Rez.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Hello, hello.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Fashionably late, as always.

[Spectator (Rez)]
Of course. James, I tried the downtime shit the other day when you told me to. It said there was an error, and it just didn't...

It was red, and it didn't go through.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Application did not respond?

[Spectator (Rez)]
Yes.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yeah, mine just did that to you. Oh, I just reloaded it, though, and it worked. Cool.

Um, the odd... Yeah. Which one?

Why is it there? Yeah.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
How unfortunate for both of them. Look at that camera. Oh my god, wait.

Sirin! Sirin has him! I have him!

How did you manage that? Uh... I don't remember.

I just have him.

[Spectator (Rez)]
Are we doing a session today, or...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yes. Yes.

[Spectator (Rez)]
Aw, shit.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
What item are you stealing, again? It is a camera that can communicate with the dead. It can take pictures of the dead.

Something like that.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Nice. So we just have to steal it from the turrets. The turret.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yeah, what do these turrets shoot? Oh, see. I was definitely thinking of, like, a fairy-themed, like, turret from, like, Fallout.

No, not Fallout, but, like, I don't know. I don't know how to... Anyway.

Yeah.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Huh.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Pixie Dust turret. Fascinating.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
So we just have to get up there without being shot? It's in the turret itself? Okay.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay. With enough convincing, we can...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh, I definitely should have brought Karis. Okay. Let's just keep going.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yeah, we can be like... We just want to look at the very cool turret.

[Manaia (Heart)]
And the turret's on... Is the turret on the third floor? Or is it on the top floor?

[Manaia (Heart)]
Ah, okay. Well, let's...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
So should we meander around? The ground floor? I guess we come up here?

Or are we going through here? Are we going through this door? Yeah, let's...

Well, I guess the front door would be... Are there any windows we could just kind of sneak in through?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Okay.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Do you have darkvision on your character? I am checking that right now. Okay, so in the case that we do start a fight, these are not bad people, right?

Okay, can we non-lethal them? Okay, cool. That is very important to this video.

Okay. Let's try to sneak in.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Alright.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Sneaking time!

[Manaia (Heart)]
How good is Minaya at sneaking? Let's see. Her stealth is a plus nine.

Okay, cool. I make sure to invest a little in that.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Alright. Yay!

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yay! One less! We're all the same.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Amazing.

[Spectator (Rez)]
I have a question. May I join in? My character is the exact opposite of stealthy.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh god. This is a heist. This is a heist, my friend.

[Spectator (Rez)]
I don't have another character. Craft one.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Sorry, Mr. Usak.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh, I need to see it.

[Spectator (Rez)]
No, you...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh my god, that. Holy shit.

[Spectator (Rez)]
This is what James thinks I look like every time I speak.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Wait, wait.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright. How many infiltration blades do we need? Oh my.

Alright. Which floor are we on? So we can go up the stairs, I'm assuming.

What's barring us from going upstairs?

[Manaia (Heart)]
We don't want to fight with them. If I perch on your shoulder, you can get an aura of professionalism. How big are you?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
This is Maniac. How big is Maniac? Because Siren is tiny and Susudio is small.

Well, she's a tiny bird. Okay, so she can perch on Susudio. Mhm.

[Manaia (Heart)]
And then, at the very least, they can think I'm just a regular crow rather than one with sentient thought. Alright.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Let's get away from the military. We don't want to awaken them. Although they're already awake, but we don't want to fuck with them.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Oh, definitely. Yes, hence the aura of authority I'm trying to give Susudio by perching on his shoulder. Okay.

Okay. Could this be society?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh, I rolled a diplomacy. Oh! And got a 22.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Right.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I believe they're still there.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Did I just lie to them? Yep.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I did. I did lie to them. But, like, I...

Did I accidentally tell the truth or did I fully just lie? You accidentally. Um.

He got his cape. I have his cape. Um.

Well, hopefully they have another scout that can tell them otherwise. So. Yeah.

Anyway. Let's carry on.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Oh, boy.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Well, I hope I don't get them all killed. Or I hope that whoever... I don't know.

Susudio is a very neutral character.

[Manaia (Heart)]
I can tell you who's there after we do this because your character doesn't know.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Right, right. Alright, let's go. Okay, not a problem.

We can get through there. Says who? Oh, we're doing...

We're doing maintenance on the floor above. There were some loose, um... Is this placement of bricks?

Out of character. Okay. There are some...

There are some bricks up there that, uh... Somebody tripped and broke a tooth on two days ago. So.

Yes, but we don't really like... Who says that? Here.

Yes, let's go back. Sorry, I can't talk right now.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
They still don't want to break a tooth. The tooth fairies have nothing to do with this. Are you a servant?

Are... Um... Uh, well, are they...

Are they a servant? Because, like, I could easily just be like, Hey, go do what you're supposed to do. This is not for you.

Okay, do I have any good intimidation? No, I don't. Okay.

And Sisirio wouldn't be doing that. This is... This is definitely Siren talking.

You know what?

[Manaia (Heart)]
I can fly past and you can be like, Oh my god, I have to get my bird! Okay, perfect. Yeah.

So, after all this confusing talk, I decide to hop off and start flying to... The next... The next floor up.

So that they can be like, Ah, my bird, you know... You know how, uh, crows are. Birdie!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh boy. Alright. Yay.

Yay. Good thinking, Minaya.

[Manaia (Heart)]
I will squawk, um, as best I can.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Squawk.

[Manaia (Heart)]
I squawk. I forget how crows are supposed to sound for a second and be like, Alright. Delightful.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright. Alright. Okay.

Well. Sisirio's not gonna say no.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yes, I am saying... Hold on. My cousin's cats are meowing very loudly.

Give me... Give me a sec.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Tooth fairy.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Oh my god. Nothing happened, they were just meowing. What happened?

I was laughing at the tooth fairy. Are there any of their bigger, scarier cousins the bone fairy? It was mostly a joke.

Yippee!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright. Um. So there's two more floors left.

There's... Well, there's this one, and then there's the floor five, and then there's the turrets. Um.

Yeah. Well, let's... I guess we start looking for...

Would it be like a hidden room or something that's here? Alright. Yay!

Uh, who has the best perception? Let... Well, let me check.

Cause I have an eight, that's my highest. RT skill. Oh.

Alright. We're... What floor are we on?

This one. Floor four. Thank you.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yay! Let's see. My perception is a plus eight.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I think I have... Detect magic. Okay.

Which will be everywhere. Detect, like, I guess, specific types of magic. Can I use that?

I don't know. I'm using it. Just, uh, I can't really hang it, cause it's part of my, um...

That. You wanna do this, Manaar?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Uh. This ends badly. Nineteen!

Not so bad. Oh, hi Nessie. Hello.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Hello.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh, perfect. So, we just... Come up here.

Oh! Perfect. Um...

[Manaia (Heart)]
Well, not much we can do about it. Strive with purpose. Don't make eye contact or give them a small nod.

I hop on Cecilia's shoulder again, and I just be like, stay calm.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Just gonna go up. There's nothing we can do.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh! Oh no!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Well, we won't tell anyone. Why are my two characters the only ones that can talk?

[Manaia (Heart)]
Am I pretending to be a dumb bird? I can! But I'm currently in the middle of pretending to be a dumb bird.

Uh, let's see. Um. Ahem.

Ah! Uh, you can nudge me being like, you were free this week or something, and I'll just be like, Ah! Uh.

Putting a falsetto crow voice. Um. Busy?

Not a lot of time. Busy! Busy!

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Uh.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Well. I suppose. Uh.

Guess we have... time.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Can I synth motive? Does she know? Synth motive.

There's a thing here. Yeah.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Please.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I don't even know who rolled that.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay, who rolled that? Which character? Okay.

Siren's like, sweating. Visibly sweating.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Perfect.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Um. Why?

[Manaia (Heart)]
We can just keep it there and keep watching. You know what? You know what, Zsuzsu do?

You can act as if I'm an item. A thing. You can put me down.

That's fair.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Are there rules against it? Shake your head.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Shake your head. I- I- I'd be like, Nope!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Sorry!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Aw.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Uh.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I'm a fairy, do I know if there are rules against hospitality- in hospitality? Okay. Uh, Minaya, you are now an object.

And we put our stuff away.

[Manaia (Heart)]
I'm- I'm also stuff. In this scenario. Me.

Minaya. Yeah. The shoulder car accessory.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
How would anybody else be put away as- as- I can't be a pet frog, and he can't be a pet fairy. Right. Zsuzsu's gonna put his two pets away.

Sirin- Sirin- Sirin is never gonna forgive Zsuzsu for this. Well, I suppose he does the same. Well, he'll relax.

He enjoys water. And frogs. A wisdom save, okay.

Wisdom save, how do I do wisdom save? There?

[Manaia (Heart)]
How do I do a wisdom save? Maybe a will save in this scenario? It's alright.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I should probably hero point that, right? Okay. Completely failed.

He's- He's just enjoying the- the bath.

[Manaia (Heart)]
You know, imagine- Imagine it's like a- like a cartoon series, and that happens, and then it flashes back to Sirin and Minaya, and it's like, man, I hope the studio is going on- is on. I don't know.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yeah. He's having a great time. Is he infatuated with her, or the pool that he's in?

Okay. Perfect.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Sure. I don't know. Where are we?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Are we in a spa? Well, I'm in a spa. Minaya and Sirin are on the fifth floor of this building, which is down in this far left corner.

We're trying to get here, to this big circle with the arrow in it. Because that's a turret, and it has a camera that Susudio wants. Oh, okay, okay.

Um...

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Sounds like you guys could use a hitter? Or maybe Rose?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Do you have any good stealth people?

[Rosie (Nessie)]
I've got Mimosa. With Mimosa? Mimosa's busy, yeah.

Oh, boy. I mean, technically... Oh, wait, Rose- Okay, you guys, I'm sorry, you get Rose.

Okay.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Minaya, Susudio...

[Rosie (Nessie)]
It works because you turn into a bottle.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh! Yeah. Well, can you have just been in my bag the whole time?

Sure. Alright. You pop out of nowhere.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
That's how she was introduced. She popped out of... Oh, god.

Which one was it, Heart? Was it Minaya's? It was the doctor.

The one she was running to. Awesome. Ah.

Ah.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Oh. Wonderful. Pattern recognition time!

Well... How- What do we need to do in order to start navigating the clothing labyrinth?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Delightful. I'm right. Detect magic.

See if I can... Oh! Oh, how small is Joran?

Who is Joran? He is... He's a kenku, or whatever their version of it is.

Tengu! A tengu. Medium.

Okay, well, I guess he can't be much of an object. Um... Maybe I just didn't bring him, because we haven't really brought him to do anything with him.

He does. He's been doing some... Could he have been just going on my stealth?

Um... Maybe he didn't get caught yet. He was below them or something.

I don't know. Are there better uses to that, though? Like, can we get- Is that a get out of jail free card?

At all?

[Manaia (Heart)]
That's probably useful, because it's a contact, so...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
So bring Joran. Boop! Joran...

I don't know. You named him. Is it Joran or Joran?

Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Is he a character, or like a...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Uh, he's... He's a hireling. Sick.

And Siren also loves playing cards.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Oh!

[Manaia (Heart)]
Ah!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Well, let's find the stairs and go up. Or wherever this is. It says a trap, so we can do disable traps.

Who's best at disabling traps? Or at least navigating the trap, which would count. We have...

Disable. Disable device. I have a plus nine to that.

Alright, let me check...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Disable device. Disable... I have an eleven for that.

Ooh, you're better. Okay. Yeah, let me check Joran really quickly.

Because I think I can do that quite easily. Disable... Yeah, we're going with Siren.

Okay, I'll just do the follow the leader activity. Hey! Twenty.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Woohoo!

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Studio's having a grand old time down there. Good for him, good for him.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Nice. Oops. Okay.

Where... The thing is in the... The turret.

Alright, gang. Right, now we just need to...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Can we find leverage on this woman? To save the studio, maybe? Maybe.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Once she stops being fascinated with him, it should be... We just have to make sure that he doesn't become a pet. Yeah, that wouldn't be great.

Dang. And I imagine you wouldn't want to bring the wrath of a fairy master right now on you.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Wait, could he become like a... Like a, um... A thrall?

Not a thrall, but like a warlock. What a warlock would be. So like, whoever the hell this is.

I don't know who this is, but she's a fairy and it's cool.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yeah. We can still find...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
He's probably just yapping about monk stuff right now. Okay. Okay.

Oh, we're down. Turret. Wherever the turret is.

How do we get to the turret? Okay, we go outside. Sneaking.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay. How many people?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I have an idea. We don't want to kill them. Well, the studio's not here, so.

Oh, yeah, that works.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Heck yeah.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Let me do it. There is a bathhouse downstairs. Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
And puppies. Sorry, ignore those paralytic shock things. I lagged out for a second before everything else came in.

So, I missed the results of the...

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
There are five people up here? Oh.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Hi, baby.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Uh-oh.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Okay, so. I'm going to paralyze the guy who didn't make the save. If that's alright.

So we can quickly grab the thing. Oh, sick! He rolled a 12?

That's great news, because my AC... I'll just roll the spell, then. Neat.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
So this guy is... I'm so sorry. You guys were doing so good until Rose got there.

It's okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
One of them is paralyzed, the other's just not. She's not as subtle to me.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Let's grab the thing.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
We have the object?

[Manaia (Heart)]
Cool. We sneak back and... Yes.

So we sneak back to being items again. Hopefully no one notices that we went on a gander. And...

Can someone hide the camera in their clothing?

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Can you take it and then turn it into a bottle?

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Why do I have to hold it? It's not mine! Turn it!

[Manaia (Heart)]
Turn it into a bottle now! Go, go, go, go, go!

[Rosie (Nessie)]
We have no time!

[Manaia (Heart)]
I carry you a bottle. Let's go.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
How big is the camera? Fine!

[Manaia (Heart)]
She's no longer putting the fake crow voice on, because it's just cool. She puts it into her backpack and turns it into a bottle. Okay, cool.

Manaia grabs the bottle in her hand and starts peddling. Let's go. So, let's all go to the object room, best we can.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
I am following you in your pouch.

[Manaia (Heart)]
I imagine I'm just holding you in my beak right now. Oh, okay. Yeah, just being like, alright!

[Rosie (Nessie)]
I don't know where that is.

[Manaia (Heart)]
So, James, we're all heading back to being objects in the object room.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Objectifying us. Shame on you. Susudio.

I may have just befriended one of the rescue dogs that I'm taking care of. They're so scared of me, bless their hearts. Uh, Susudio.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Window.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
How do we rescue Susudio? Is he still, like, kinda mindfucked, though? Okay, cool.

[Manaia (Heart)]
So we can... Window? Who feels like just leaping out the window in some sort of way?

Gosh, Danit, you're right. Why would there be a window in the sauna? Uh, hmm.

Hmm. Well, there's only one path, and it is forwards, or upstairs and through that window, but you might see us scaling down.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Let me see if I have anything. Oh, I'm a natural climber. I could put at least one person on my back, I'm sure, and climb down.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yes, but that might be obvious, because we're climbing down a manor, so... But the other problem is walking past all the... Yeah, okay, let's see if we can go down the back of the manor.

That'd be insane.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
I can fly. Okay.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Or at the very least glide to the ground once my flight stops working.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Yeah.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Okay. I missed what happened because the computer lagged out, so... Well, he's fine, but it did complicate things a little bit.

Okay, so... Okay. So do act as if you're still enamored and wondering where your lady love went if people see you just falling out the window.

Alright? Perfect. Cool.

What is her name? We'll get the, um... Names?

Were you told? Because I think Vinaya knows. Um...

Who is he enthralled to? What's her name? Hold on, I have it somewhere.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alright, well we can just... We can pretend.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Yeah. Maid of Windmere. Maid of Windmere.

That was... The spider-liking lady. Okay.

So, that is her name. I think Vinaya knows this because she was... Was she on one of these missions?

On one of those missions? I'm double-checking. I think she would know, actually, because she's friends with Klingon.

Klingon died in her thing, so... Okay. Um...

Yeah, so Vinaya will tell you if you weren't told.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Alrighty.

[Manaia (Heart)]
Um, is that me, or...? It can be me, I can be like... Not me, then.

[Sussudio & Ceryn (Frogitha)]
Okay, diplomacy, diplomacy. Oh, Satudia, don't fail me. Ha ha!

Yay, camera! Okay.

[Rosie (Nessie)]
Don't you be paying me to get it back.

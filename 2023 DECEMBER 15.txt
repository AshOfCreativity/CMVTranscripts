[Speaker 2]
We're wondering where like dragons are and stuff before we make like Yeah, did you guys see the message?

[Speaker 4]
I posted?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. Yes, but I couldn't like i'm probably blind but I did not where did you post it?

[Speaker 1]
uh Dragon, oh, there we go north east uh Because it came out of the fire portals which you'll see by the group members here Where's the fire does it say fire portal anywhere? Oh, he just says okay members and you'll see which icons that have uh, burning bushes I'm burning burning bushes Oh, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
So Ryan, do we have to watch out for moses? Uh, did you you were asking about the uh, the other character, right? The character?

[Speaker 7]
What other character?

[Speaker 3]
Oh the wizard Uh, no No So someone was asked. Oh, wait. No, that was uh varan varanet.

Is that what I say that?

[Speaker 6]
You were asking about the uh, the wizard you're asking what class Oh, yeah, I did uh, would you be interested in piloting her because i'm Maybe but I have problems with why my character is so giant When I put icon on the map Let's see here.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that's not a concern right now. Uh, but I did put it. I did put the answer in the chat Uh, as I said remember if you have a question It doesn't require immediate attention.

Please put it in the chat Okay line up by the grove of embers, okay, so Let's see here Like I asked earlier is anybody making stops or detours along the way The river goes up by the vampire tomb progresses to the lakes on the left side Uh swings by the town of orton Can we stop at mcdonald's? And And We'll continue. Let's hear one of the branching rivers Will flow down towards the growth embers Uh, hey james, could you give uh varanet access to celia?

I would know celia actually exists right now and also no Yeah, uh Wild fucking character, I think I should probably delete her I might have already I might have already added her to the Defunct characters. I can't recall though What characters? defunct characters like ones that never Or they're like absent or whatever.

We've had like we've had over a hundred people come through total And I think we passed a hundred sometime last month God, damn it What are we damning?

[Speaker 2]
I was drawing the line and it dragged me to Something hello gamers Okay, but I will bring all three of the characters in that case If we can just filter it and you insist that it's different because you they're currently in the caravan That's not done you? Holy shit. Okay.

I bring two characters.

[Speaker 1]
You guys didn't even finish up the car the uh caravan during that session I don't mention the fact that it's very long It's pretty far into the future Wait, it's in the future Huh, what?

[Speaker 7]
What I don't have much I don't have very long i'm able to play Uh, are we still waiting on stuff? Nope Already you guys tell me that you're starting Let's go, yo, we're starting yeah, let us begin Let us go gamer Hello gamers Hello, uh, i'm former president brock obama All right, so we are at like sierra's keep right?

[Speaker 1]
Yep Uh, that's my assumption because I I asked you guys like six times if you were doing a detour So i'm gonna say no at this point. No, yeah If you think of something along the way I can let you know or take a break Uh, we are I wanted Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
I wanted to keep my eyes open for rituals along the fey line by the grove of embers I don't know if you want to roll for that It's possible.

[Speaker 1]
I will have some encounter stuff going on behind the scenes to do like, uh, private roles and stuff uh What Is this rough travel? What do you what does rough travel mean?

[Speaker 2]
It's in the down like when traveling spells lottery region is slow and stuff this is on our particular tumultuous Because you said we were taking a boat and that doesn't seem very like Harsh, that's why I thought it was kind of important to clarify.

[Speaker 1]
Let's let's say no for the moment Okay, but anyways Yep I say remember what I said earlier guys go ahead and please if you have a question Then the chat first second Especially while somebody's talking, um What was I thinking of Oh, well, okay, so you guys are going to stop by a ferry It's going to be on the let's hear. It's the first of the new month On the simple calendar. It's monday in the month of willier Yeah, this is the same day that mimosas party meets a An assy critter I don't know if I made that visible to everybody who knows Let's see here I'm gonna roll for weather You guys are going on to a ferry it's going to be about a 10 day travel to the swamp juncture And it will be about 10 days It's going to be about five gold pieces per person

[Speaker 8]
Are we rolling exploration

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you will not have to Even though you're going to be on this boat I've got things to still get I do still roll for things while you're on the boat, but the See here You can do a bit of rolling. Uh Sorry, I do still roll for things while you're in a caravan or while you're traveling with troops it's just the results of those usually Change or rather the behavior of encounters tends to change For instance if you come across a my classic example is if you come across an owl bear and you have an army with you Generally, the owl bear doesn't attack.

It just kind of goes in the other direction likely before you even catch sight of it As a carrier you could probably shop while you're on the boat All right, 50 gold pieces. Go ahead and everybody distract that from your

[Speaker 2]
50 to 5

[Speaker 1]
It'll be 50 gold pieces because you guys are traveling for 10 days

[Speaker 3]
Five gold per day

[Speaker 8]
here

[Speaker 1]
the caravan itself looks like a Large almost like a like a not silly a train like a tram car It's multiple different wooden platforms that have been Tied together or chained together that are being pulled by two Worm-like creatures at the front with a single sensory organ or eye stalk on top of their head

[Speaker 9]
I'm being called here

[Speaker 1]
All right, thank you apartment things, uh getting cleared up my goodness Did not want to pay two thousand dollars to move into the other apartment Already signed at least but i'm going to have to break it before I move in which is a lot easier to do in texas especially without Paying any money.

It's an important thing. So Uh on this ferry you're giving you guys are given the option of like traveling with other carts or if you would like to travel with Um, yeah traveling with other carts or if you want a cart to yourselves These little tram boat things There are merchants and shopkeepers who are transporting cargo on this place They're happy to discuss with you

[Speaker 3]
Okay Okay How much for a vial of wyvern venom

[Speaker 1]
Wyvern poison is 1200

[Speaker 3]
Easy

[Speaker 2]
Oh my how much money do you have?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, I mean, it's pretty much gonna Lend me almost bankrupt about 144 gold pieces But this is for something later down the line.

[Speaker 1]
It's the first of many to create my ultimate weapon Oh, yeah, the multi-hitch crossbow would be pretty cool with that All right, there we go, okay So there's a Uh, there's a few different guards and npcs on this rather npcs On this boat. There's frederick numbers. Who's the leader?

Of the guard here. He looks rather beat up and has a bunch of Flowers and other plants growing out of his armor For no reason It looks rather dour and unhappy as does the rest of his particular crew There's also a fellow in robes who looks like a sage or wizard He doesn't introduce himself per se but he does make your acquaintance like oh, it's nice to meet you says hi and just kind of Keeps himself for the most part And Then there's a few shopkeeps here There's rupert shades who is transporting some mushroom cargo or is back from transporting some mushroom cargo it's one of the guild members of And people are just oh, uh, there's also captain willoughby Who's just gnomish creature?

running around uh giving a lot of orders to the Crew for the first part of the morning and then he tends to get drunk into the afternoon mostly just leaves people alone

[Speaker 3]
For the mushroom guy, could I like ask him a bit about what kind of mushrooms he's transporting

[Speaker 1]
Well, I was transporting uh I was transporting just regular mushrooms For the most part there's a few that work as alchemical reagents.

We had about a crate of those We also had a what else am I thinking of it also had a few or So the alchemical reagents well I found out that my crew and kind of looks over at frederick Was actually transporting a lot of my mushrooms throughout the feywild about the road And this was turning them sentient and extra tasty

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, uh Okay, those two things don't normally go together i'm just going to ignore that that's

[Speaker 1]
Some of them were all of them were tasty, but some of them were Why is this person calling me back? Sorry, give me a sec

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, tiana is like, uh Okay, we're just going to ignore that

[Speaker 7]
I have not thought of a personality For my new paladin yet

[Speaker 3]
You know, hold on If I if I may, uh, I wonder if I could try and steal I know that's kind of like I know I know I want to be a bad boy for once for real

[Speaker 2]
But I still don't have enough money for the boat, I mean the paladin will only fight him if the paladin finds out

[Speaker 4]
Because I'll front you Half for the boat somebody else cover his other half

[Speaker 6]
I have 16 gold. What?

[Speaker 4]
How do you i'll give you 25?

[Speaker 6]

[Speaker 3]
Did you hear about the thieving shenanigans? Uh is thieving considered anti-social like I want to actually ask like how I I really What do you what do you think?

[Speaker 1]
Anti-social well, here's the thing. Uh If you're doing some anti-social shit in downtime if you're doing like thieving in downtime Then that is a different kind of anti-social Then because you're not really you're not screwing with anybody else then for instance risking getting people Picked off the boat Right, of course if everybody is fine with that risk then Yeah, no, everyone's cool Is everyone cool?

[Speaker 2]
No, no Yeah, yeah, but one person doesn't then, you know, it's kind of what are you trying to steal uh Those alchemical reagents that those mushrooms he's coming back.

[Speaker 3]
You want magic? Oh, he's coming back words. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I want magic mushrooms You know, there's a drug section in like the uh, never mind what you think Some kind of drug addict, bro No, i'm You really okay i'm yeah, no, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Well the people on the boat will be selling you wyvern poison Uh daiko says he only has 16 gold pieces the same. We're going to cover for daiko. I don't know why only i'll cover for him I'll cover for him.

[Speaker 2]
He's a monk. His starting gold isn't multiplied by 10 So he rolled two gold He rolled 13 gold And he rolled 13 gold he multiplied by eight A monk 54 gp average 13 gp.

[Speaker 8]
I don't have Anyways, um, so yeah, so this fellow is going to sell you the That is loud as hell. Yeah, why is it not playing on my end?

[Speaker 2]
And we have some down down you have the tab unit or something because I always Is your chrome working like or like is your Happened.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's just um, i'm listening on my Bluetooth and I think what happened was it cut out?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's gone now.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know There we go, I could hear the scar music I don't know why I couldn't hear the other one but So the fellow in robes earlier has taken an interest in you folks, especially zekira, especially After the After he buys the File of wyvern voices. Well, boy, what are you? Somewhat pretty inquisitive and you're buying Interesting specialty items here.

What are you up to exactly?

[Speaker 3]
Hi For hire, yes depends on the pay, okay I Is he asking me if i'm for hire if i'm for hire Is that what he's asking?

[Speaker 1]
Yes Anyways, what's your what's your purpose with this wyvern? Poison here poisoning arrows And I just give like the most bland response I can yes, I Thought that they might be useful as an implement, but i'm particularly interested in whatever your target might be a dragon Oh Doing a bit of dragon hunting myself You see a few months ago. I heard a shipment of them got lost somewhere near orton and not all were recovered Shipment of dragons Yes, uh non-sentience And uh incapable of casting spells young I believe past the wormling Fascinating do we hear this or do I hear this?

You guys can be wherever you want to be on the boat.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, what kind of dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they were white as I recall or maybe cobalts Are they dangerous? Are dragons dangerous? I feel like um Come on, you're clearly experienced at worldly.

I feel like you're just making fun of me

[Speaker 3]
But but here ralph they can't cast spells then then what are they

[Speaker 2]
Well, they might prove fateful servants after all

[Speaker 1]
Where did you say this shipment was If they can't cast spells the apex predators and granted somewhat disposable apex predators, but still strong in their own right

[Speaker 9]
uh

[Speaker 1]
set it was by the Town of orton there's a number of different lake structures and fishers there talking of natural spring Something about an unlikely place for them to home, but you know interesting nonetheless

[Speaker 2]
Thank you How old does he appear to be?

[Speaker 1]
He appears to be in his late 40s Okay Yeah, thank you Kind of looks it kind of looks like if you've seen scavenger's reign. He kind of looks like sam Uh strong but a little bit of pudge around the midsection. Not quite a spare tire Got a uh, pretty big arms white hair.

That's been thinning and a big old white beard

[Speaker 9]
Thank you

[Speaker 2]
That's for sure worth checking out sometime

[Speaker 1]
I hope you're not uh trying to kill the white dragons that i'm after or at least

[Speaker 2]
Oh, definitely i'm looking for

[Speaker 4]
We're traveling to a different area Yes

[Speaker 7]
I believe we were hunting a uh red dragon

[Speaker 1]
It was a red one, correct a red you say

[Speaker 2]
I would like tap you on the shoulder perhaps don't reveal everything to strangers who meet along the way

[Speaker 9]
We can keep some secrets

[Speaker 1]
Wizard after all I understand but my interest in Dragons is elemental in nature.

Well, I should say elementary, but that's a I I prefer their elemental power For charging spells and fixing up new spells and research just makes things go by a little bit more quickly I find Go ahead, where exactly are you headed friend? Well, like I said i'm going to be checking first the town of orton when we swing by it and after that i'm not entirely sure Um, i'm gonna tell him about sierra's keep and kind of invite him to visit Oh, I did hear about uh, I did hear about the new baroness as I was coming up. I only I only visit this place about Once every year maybe two years or so.

I had to take a gap in the previous year, but Too many too many other things to attend to but I did hear there was a new baroness. That's pleasant Hope she's good at dancing But yes Uh, so the next Wait, what exactly does that mean? I hope that she's pleasant company I do love treating with nobles All right.

[Speaker 4]
I I don't know if that just kind of confused me.

[Speaker 3]
So I'll question question if we help you with these white dragons as you say Would you back us up? Hmm a red dragon is As you might expect a little dangerous And you seem to know your your way around a couple spells I'm getting a little insight on this guy now me I I I know very little about magic, but I've almost been blown up by a fireball or two.

[Speaker 1]
So he looks very confused by the conversation because he thought it was going to go into a tangent towards Like he thought he was going to go towards attention on like ballroom dances and diplomacy And noble alliances and it's back to dragon hunting.

[Speaker 4]
It looks ever so slightly disappointed Okay, I I was wondering if it was like an evil euphemism or something But no, he's just confused Okay, continue.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry Well, hmm It's not really how I handle things Of course I am interested in various, um, let me think on it. How about that?

[Speaker 2]
Sounds like a plan you are highly knowledgeable of dragons, aren't you here? A man of great knowledge Sorry, what did you say what I'd like to think so Have you seen a fang dragon around?

[Speaker 1]
Hang dragon Oh great dragons Yes Not a steel not quite in these parts, but you have seen them on brackets Yes Very rarely. They don't really do well here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, i've noticed Uh, where have you where have you seen them?

[Speaker 1]
If you i've seen them in brackets, I see them in other places in the world Met one that had made a made a home down south Which was uh across the sea in the desert below Or the desert to the south We Go on We must stay in touch you and I Oh sure I do plenty of correspondence if you have a diplomacy pouch like myself. It has a pack at his side It just kind of looks like a normal messenger bag. You can Reach me anytime I don't Oh, is that exactly?

But you could probably send some correspondence to you Might take up an adjunct professorship later this fall At the glassblowers academy that's up in the air, but if you send any correspondence there, you might be able to Well, they might be able to have it reach me after a time What's your name?

[Speaker 2]
Again hori Can okay, I assume I just understood how to spell that hori like h o r y No, that's right over here He's gonna retire to his Carp for the day.

[Speaker 1]
Of course. It is a little boat private raft for the day Mm-hmm Captain willoughby is running around in his usual drunken stupor at this point in the afternoon And he's like, hey, hey, don't don't bother the guests Please not the vips Which one of us is he talking to? Whoever's in this little mass of people here, so he's telling us not to bother each other No, no him specifically he bought a private cot You're not to be bothered you know Just just just don't he kind of like walks off

[Speaker 8]
People confuse me

[Speaker 1]
The rest of the day will pass uneventfully Second day also pretty uneventful Uh frederick at some point comes up to chiron and says hey you you look like you're pretty Uh, you're uh, pretty witchy if that makes sense and I was wondering if you had Something to help me

[Speaker 4]
What gives it away is that the horn is it the antlers or the staff

[Speaker 1]
Hmm you get a bow

[Speaker 4]
I'm just messing with you buddy. What do you need?

[Speaker 1]
Well, it like lifts it. He takes he's got where are you headband? He kind of like lifts it up The headband has like this brown tasseled hair that's like falling over his forehead He lifts everything up and there's a symbol of what looks like a lemon Like an art nouveau lemon On his forehead.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I know exactly who you fucked with. What did you do?

[Speaker 1]
We didn't fuck I just died In his domain, oh, okay Okay Does he want something in return what? Well, yeah, I have to have to go to his home and do chores every once in a while Sometimes I go there well Not for me because sometimes I go there and i'll like pass by You know It'll be like no time at all has passed even though I spent a week cleaning his place And then one time later earlier this week actually I disappeared right as we were about to go into port.

[Speaker 4]
I came back a week later And fell into the water It's gonna get me killed again um Brett bozo Who is such a messed with I know oh citron, um Citron, um, he's a fey lord. He's all about lemons.

[Speaker 7]
Oh, that makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
It's in his name Yeah He's inattentive He doesn't listen when you're talking to him and he constantly makes additional messes in ways that I have no idea how to understand And makes me clean them up for no reason That's just a fey dude.

[Speaker 4]
He's not special Yeah, that sounds like something a fey would do I'm gonna pull oberon's wreath off my shoulder um under its feature oberon's charm Um, it can write a letter for me using the diplomacy downtime action um, so I want to use the wreath to Write a letter to citron basically like advocating for this guy Going if you're gonna have mortals coming in and working for you. You've got to be a little Understanding of their needs Right to the manager.

[Speaker 1]
Go ahead and roll me a persuasion check there Do I get advantage or anything for using the bow? I believe you do Yep Excellent, so I think the way it works based on what I wrote you get advantage for a few different reasons at this point Oh wait, there's downtime pdf in inside foundry. There we go here There it is Uh-huh Okay, uh, you quickly receive a letter back It's kind of on the carried on the wind and day delivery Yeah stitch with leaves comes back it says understood will provide stable of harlots for his recovery Uh sorrows and prayers for getting wet citron Yeah, well, I mean, I guess that'll improve things Not exactly what is requested I'm i'll let him read it.

[Speaker 4]
I can't read this Oh, then I will translate it for him.

[Speaker 1]
It's probably in sylvan Is it oh Okay All right That's that's Okay That's it's not specifically, you know, i'm not Not gonna lift not gonna look at gift horse in the mouse already And uh just kind of walked over And is this the captain or one of the sailors? No, this is frederick. This is one of the caravan guards Oh, okay It goes over to see here he goes over to his room and you see You see like an explosion of lemon juice Kind of like splatter over the just splatter over the room and another letter comes post haste Or sorry post script is labeled ps.

I need him for a few minutes What a great guy Is that god?

[Speaker 7]
this is just like some like actual god like Sending stuff No, he's not a god.

[Speaker 4]
Um, he is a Um, he's a powerful fae um, so he's He has a free trial of godhood arrogant

[Speaker 2]
The free trial of godhood arrogant spirit of mischief, right Like mostly

[Speaker 1]
That's a good one So when it comes to let's see here the third day Willoughby comes over Sober this time because it's not it's in the morning and one of the It's still misty foggy out kind of weather kind of sucks in general straight and Caravan the this little watery train here has come to a halt I was back.

He's like hey, um I I know I was rude to you rat catchers earlier. I just was wondering That we're all going to the same place If you could assist with a tiny tiny problem We appear to be dealing with Of course I can help you What's the problem? It was like something knocked over a lot of trees into the river And it's at one of the one of the more shallow crossings there's a spot where there's a lot more Rocks here and people tend to free order they can And so it's one of the few places where these things, you know detritus can actually get stuck It's the the volume that i'm having an issue with Yeah Thank you.

[Speaker 4]
Thank you Um, give me five minutes before you guys get started on that Um, i'm going to look through my familiars senses and I have her Um go invisible and stealth around and see if something has intentionally caused this

[Speaker 1]
Sending the familiar ahead you see a Well one day it's exactly as described these trees have been freshly knocked down and blown away There is a blow into the river But looking from left to right the familiar notices that there's what looks to be like a tunnel that Something Like a tunnel of just like trees that have been blown from west to east Over it's it's like a almost not quite perfectly Cylindrical, but it's it's it's relatively close.

[Speaker 3]
I will describe it to the group So what the hell are we going to do we're still on the boat, right That's correct Okay, good.

[Speaker 2]
Are we sure we want to help with this? Would be like Like are we getting a reward for it?

[Speaker 3]
We're getting to continue our voyage I would Oh, yeah fair enough james was talking about There's something blocking our way and We need to I don't think it's a creature I think it's a bunch of wooden logs that were blown in there possibly by a creature But we could just blow it fucking open if someone has like a fireball or two to spare I have the warlock at short rest.

[Speaker 1]
I turned over the captain i'm like If you ram your boat into this thing will the hull hold No Well, that's not even that's not even necessarily the issue is I can't uh, the wormingers aren't going to be able to get them over the over these logs to begin with assuming that some of the Trams and capsize and I have a number of More high profile planes around this time of year.

[Speaker 3]
So I don't want I don't wish you Well, I'll tell you what We're gonna go take care of this problem one way or another. So, uh Just have that boat ready.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you pay us.

[Speaker 7]
Uh, you can continue the journey Yes, i'm going to go afterwards i'll give you a return for free Free return that would be nice.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, I do not do things for awards anyways

[Speaker 2]
That's good I can have your share Now

[Speaker 7]
She's my character's a paladin so she's kind of like It's hard to explain like oh I do things just for good, but then she also wants money too, but she won't like say it out loud

[Speaker 2]
She's just like she's a hypocrite

[Speaker 4]
No matter all right, so How deep is the water

[Speaker 1]
At this section probably it's About Somewhere between four to six feet deep in most places Seems like a lot of silt has been kicked up and sediment has been kicked up recently specifically from this Cylinder you're familiar hasn't seen how far it goes in either direction because visibility is limited to about 60 feet But it goes past Other directions that he's able to see

[Speaker 4]
That's troubling

[Speaker 2]
I mean fireball solves it right or like a big like A fireball should make space.

[Speaker 1]
Anyway, yeah, if you're going to use like concussive blasts and stuff like that, that's totally fine Any uh professional wizards here Wait there.

[Speaker 3]
I just remember there is a professional wizard. Hold up. Let me go get him Evelyn is like the wizard on speed dial and I go to find uh, what was what's his name?

[Speaker 7]
Corey I have no that's a different guy.

[Speaker 2]
It is the second tram The second cart There we go Okay, I mean I could just fireball it otherwise like it's not an issue Okay I can do nothing. I'll just uh, or evelyn will just like nonchalantly wave her hand and like fireball Oh, i'm i'm i'm not evelyn Hello, i'm evelyn You both have characters named evelyn wait, seriously, that's awesome.

[Speaker 7]
Oh god, we can refer to evelyn as novelty then Okay Um, well, I i'm I didn't even bring my evelyn anyways, yes, that's not relevant to the current situation Yeah Yep. All right, so you fireball it goes perfectly fine

[Speaker 1]
uh Some of the logs start spreading outwards makes the ride a little bit more bumpy And the worming the worms at the front of the ship make these weird humming groans like a mix between a Whale and it's like the mix between a whale and a crocodile That's kind of how it sounds but a little bit higher pitched

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it would cost to speak with animals Without using a spell slot you should arrange your feature

[Speaker 8]
Sure

[Speaker 2]
I like try to hear what they are talking about saying ready

[Speaker 1]
Scraping my skin miserable things here.

[Speaker 7]
We could smell predators Predators Predators Oh, no, the worms are hurting wait, what worms are there like are they purple?

[Speaker 2]
What kind of worms?

[Speaker 1]
They're mentioned earlier. I described them earlier. They are Large they're aquatic.

They kind of look like planarians They have a single sensory organ or eye stalk on the tops of their heads and they're being Encouraged along by way of bait that is placed in front of them Okay They're getting splinters I assume that they would no longer pull if we fed them, right? Or like woody stuff or I mean they they do get fed but like Okay. Yeah, the the wormingers Hey, hey, don't don't I don't know what you're doing there.

You get it's okay if you talk to them, but don't like Don't mess. Don't mess with the worms. Okay Don't feed them If you listen If you lady if you want to feed them tonight That's fine.

Just not right now. Okay, we got to navigate here And they seem agitated as is The worms are still talking like oh The bait smells like ash Smells like ash and high clouds Wait, no, they wouldn't say high clouds. Uh, they would say it smells like ash and hurricanes Well, that's tragic Where are we exactly?

You guys are just now coming to the area on the map that's marked white dragon search area Okay Where is this You can literally there's a blue line.

[Speaker 4]
Yes Oh Are you telling people what the worms are telling you? Yes I am Um kairona is gonna climb up on top of one of the Carts carriages, but I don't remember what they're being called exactly And meryl's gonna climb up on top of another one What are they doing, uh, just keeping an eye on the horizon being ready for an attack All right, this sounds good do you want to make have them both make vanguard checks basically Uh, yeah, what do you want me to roll? Just something appropriate.

I mean, yeah, you tell me what you want to roll No, not performance My wi-fi went out again.

[Speaker 7]
Why why does this only happen?

[Speaker 4]
All right, that was bad Yep, it's just there's just too much fog right now. It's a problem All right, and i'm sure there are plenty of ominous creepy noises indeed

[Speaker 1]
Now while you guys are in the local lake area while you guys are traveling along a All of the mist gets blown out from one direction From the west going from south to north You hear it It sounds like a loud boom Like a while away and then seconds afterwards you see the mist part from like the southwest going to the northwest But there's nothing there's nothing there when this happens Except a lot of debris and detritus that appears to have kind of been scattered about Everybody is on edge.

Everybody's freaked out Now frederick who has been returned safely this time in a Dynamic look he's been dynamically placed back into the world uh He's getting all the caravan guards ready. Just kind of like hanging they're hanging out. They've all got crossbows ready But you know, they're like level zero men-at-arms effectively there's Getting ready to shoot at something but they don't know what's going on

[Speaker 9]
Oh

[Speaker 7]
We're gonna go do something this is all those

[Speaker 1]
First of they will pass uneventfully if nobody's doing anything

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't think it would be a good idea to just fire shots into the dark blind well not dark but dog blindly

[Speaker 3]
Hey for a bit of fun, can you explain like, uh, what kind of food we eat here on ship

[Speaker 1]
You guys are mostly you might expect it to be fish and that would be wrong There's actually there are fishermen on the boat who are reeling stuff in and occasionally get a little bit of fried catfish with the uh from the mess cart But really they've been prioritizing cakes desserts and One other thing they've been oh steaks That they picked up before Bronloch

[Speaker 3]
You know Steak is my favorite food. So i've Can I sell me?

[Speaker 2]
Thank or like is is the food included in the price?

[Speaker 1]
Can you sell food? Uh the foods? Yeah Like basic food like all right, you get a portion.

It's kind of expected to get some food here Um for selling food, what are you trying to sell?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, never I I assumed that food wasn't included.

[Speaker 1]
I wanted to sell good berries Since they give like nobody was gonna go for that unless they were starving. No, I didn't know what's gonna find the good berries You know, they give you enough nutrients to last for a day, right That is like oh I want to eat a blueberry and not be hungry for the rest of the day I would eat a blueberry and not be hungry. Some people might do it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah That is that is the food for giving to the clinically depressed and If I get proficiency cooks in cooks utensils, can I make good berry ice cream?

[Speaker 1]
It's good berry ice cream. It's not going to be tasty and oh Um bad berry ice cream.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, stop pulling my good berries, okay I sacrificed so much damage for this stop promoting the berries.

[Speaker 3]
No one cares about the good berries. I'm, sorry I don't eat at least one of your good berries.

[Speaker 1]
I'll give everyone except you a good berry res, I will consume so not At the front of the um at the front of the tram Another there's another blockage that comes up this time. Corey comes up and blasts it away This is well i'll be hopefully rejoining you folks Soon again, I just need to do a little bit of work here and i'll be returning Uh the next day you guys do come across a fey ritual It looks like a ritual to the green god of orton. Somebody has trapped a pseudodragon Basically tied it down with ley lines in front of the uh in front of this statue What kind of pseudodragon so um Theresia is the green god right now That's as far as you know.

Yes. Well, no you you have confirmed this.

[Speaker 4]
Yes Okay. Um, I am not only going to rescue the pseudodragon. I am going to fuck up that ritual What's the other dragon?

[Speaker 1]
Superdragon What kind? I need you to be more specific Like what color? What color?

Yeah Dragon colored sun is going to this one is going to be cobalt.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah Fine by me Oh, yeah, that guy wanted cobalt dragons to me, I mean it's a pseudodragon Yeah, let's save it if it tries to kill us.

[Speaker 1]
Um That's our problem It should be fine No, no, no if it tries to kill us, uh, we'll just say um Whoops Yes what he said My client would like to plead oopsie daisies Yeah, that's enough that's enough mean talk for like probably the next five sessions I think i've had Okay, whatever you say. Um No, this is specifically for like if you're just saying like obama Yeah, like what is it Like why?

[Speaker 2]
But we don't want to disturb the ritual, right? No one here has any moral obligation to disturb the ritual, right?

[Speaker 1]
I think Specifically kairona mentioned that she'll be doing exactly that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I thought she said opposite No Oh god, okay.

[Speaker 7]
No, i've got a thing going on with thyrsia right now I don't even know which god my paladin prays to I don't know anything about dnd god Paladin is one of oats anyways oats All right.

[Speaker 1]
So kairona, what are you doing here? Is anybody participating? There's like three little There's like three little um symbols around the around this particular pseudodragon one of them is Red and bears the bark of the green god.

The other two are just kind of generic magic circles.

[Speaker 4]
They're both Blank like they're gray In a way, that's uh bright and glowing um, i'm gonna Release the pseudodragon and change um the symbol of the green god to one of oberon All right, how do you release the pseudodragon though? You said it's like tied up in ley lines and ley lines I wonder if I can Kind of like cut them or untangle them with the unicorn staff With the unicorn staff.

[Speaker 1]
Okay Go ahead and make me an arcana check here Oh ow How did you get a seven?

[Speaker 4]
Because I rolled a two plus five.

[Speaker 1]
I'll do it so Well shit, okay, uh, so you You rolled two, um, so you begin Moving the unicorn staff to uh to draw the symbol of oberon And the unicorn staff sort of gets a mind of its own And just kind of like you're probably you're poking you're prodding You're like tracing the lines with the tip of the staff. I mean, I did specifically want to use the staff to free Yeah, yeah, you're like carving it into the um at this point the You said you're carving the the symbol of oberon, right? Yes, okay Wait, what I was gonna do both but Oh because I assume that you're doing sorry, can you tell me again what you're trying to do or I or if there's something that i'm saying that's wrong here or I don't know.

[Speaker 4]
Just go with what you got.

[Speaker 1]
All right. I'll just go with what I got So you carve the symbol you begin carving the symbol of oberon into the Into this and instead you get something that kind of looks like a Six-winged butterfly Brain just kind of like Blanks out for a second and you look down and you're like that's not what I meant to do at all Uh, that symbol is where the green god symbol is currently glowing green This one is currently glowing red

[Speaker 4]
My intention was to replace the symbol of the green god

[Speaker 8]
what

[Speaker 2]
If you want to move the dragon can I like shove it to the side

[Speaker 1]
Kind of like trapped in this magical barrier here with telekinetic just boom. I don't think so Okay, like can I shove somebody through a force cage

[Speaker 2]
Where uh, no, it's an okay Oh jesus my ow, wait dimension door if wait a minute

[Speaker 8]
I don't know if you can make a dimension door small enough Do you take a creature that's smaller than you

[Speaker 1]
yeah, there'd be like a contested check here, but um That would potentially do something

[Speaker 2]
Okay, can I Try that

[Speaker 1]
I think what you need to do is I guess technically the super dragon needs to do this Let's make a charisma save Does anybody have a way that I don't know how good a pseudo dragons

[Speaker 2]
Wisdom save uh

[Speaker 3]
Let me act in the morning, it's a charisma have have a yeah

[Speaker 2]
It's someone quick do something and I can still Prove barbs you and give the dragon

[Speaker 9]
advantage

[Speaker 2]
I'm

[Speaker 7]
I don't know what to do Can anyone do a backflip?

[Speaker 2]
A backflip something what no, but like I need to steal performance from something to give to the dragon if anyone could like do something they're usually pretty good at it

[Speaker 6]
I can roll acrobatics if you want to to do a backflip or something

[Speaker 2]
hell yeah can you do a yeah try to do a backflip

[Speaker 1]
where's the okay

[Speaker 2]
uh wait no second uh let me just double check

[Speaker 1]
um if you tell me what you're trying to do right now it'll i'm trying i'm trying to uh

[Speaker 2]
uh like steal you silver your barbs on varanat and then give the dragon the advantage on the save so he wrote he wrote the acrobatics for a backflip okay uh i i still rebarbs your backflip

[Speaker 1]
okay all right we'll give the this critter advantage all right yeah sure it's pretty simple ritual uh the pseudo dragon does disappear from the ritual the last symbol there glows blue and just kind of has a basic rune for banishment

[Speaker 2]
and attached to it and so yes did it get out or did we like did it succeed or in the middle

[Speaker 1]
okay i'm just kind of panicking that's no i totally i get it um yeah the super dragon gets out oh thank god all right uh so it's gonna happen in a few minutes everybody go ahead and take like a 10 50 minute break and i'm gonna get a battle map ready

[Speaker 7]
i have to go pick up my brother in like 10 minutes but i'll be back like 20 or 30 minutes after that all right certainly fine so it should still be there for the dragon fight yes

[Speaker 2]
but like what are we fighting are we fighting the pseudo dragon the red dragon remember wait yeah no we're fighting the red dragon but like right now at the summoning circle james said he was going to go get a battle map and i'm wondering for what like wait i got super confused can you explain the situation right now uh we freed a pseudo dragon right and james said everyone take a 10 to 15 minute break so that i can go and get a battle map and i'm like what

[Speaker 6]
yeah imagine dying before the actual fight with the red dragon no i mean it's a pseudo dragon

[Speaker 2]
it has like like one hit point 13 hit points i don't know wait it's gonna be strange if it gives one hit point and it seems kind of stupid to just free it like that cost a fourth level spell slot if we want to kill it like if we just wanted to kill it then we could have just stabbed it we are very good at stabbing out here oh well okay sure

[Speaker 1]
all right bar am i am i being insane right now oh wait i don't know if you're there it'll wait for you to come back if it's uh water map ready i don't know mom gets home oh hey no oh are you here yeah i'm here sorry hey no you're fine um i was waiting for you to get back all right was i was i insane during that i feel like i'm going nuts right now i don't know if it's uh if it's the adderall or something like that what are you going insane about i don't know um at first i was confused about the the method like when i was describing like all right there's this thing trapped by ley lines

[Speaker 4]
yeah i was kind of hoping that i could like touch the unicorn horn to it and have the ley lines magically untangle or something right that's what i was cheating a little bit

[Speaker 1]
i should have given you the uh i should have just given you advantage on that um the one thing i'm really fucking annoyed about right now is the the constant like um this guy just listing lines off of ifunny i think i need him to not do that uh which guy veronat uh ryan

[Speaker 4]
oh yeah like i like the way veronat plays but i can't understand his accent for the hell of me

[Speaker 1]
i veronat seems like a pretty cool guy i also have trouble figuring out his accent though

[Speaker 4]
all right but i pretty much got what i wanted to do with the ritual i think we killed its power source um and so it's not gonna do theresia any good and that's good enough hell yeah all right

[Speaker 1]
there we go um oh the other thing was yeah uh you guys aren't fighting a shoot a pseudo dragon i

[Speaker 4]
have no idea where they got that no the pseudo dragon was trapped in the ritual and we let it

[Speaker 1]
go yeah i just i'm like by the way guys just take like a 10-15 minute break maybe at a battle map are we fighting the pseudo dragon are we fighting the pseudo dragon only has 13 hit points are we

[Speaker 4]
playing this oh my god stop ah anyways all right it's like that um men in black quote about a person is smart people are stupid and panicky player is smart players are stupid and panicky that seems right to me oh um did you see my comment in um voice of your flow um i'd really love to do something um against theresia in orton next session so like on our way back to

[Speaker 1]
sierra's keep on the river that would be interesting because tomorrow i'm running for you never met orville armory or alton did you or their players i don't think so okay because they they along with landy were pretty much carrying the initial launch of the west marches and they were like the primary group and then i think they got bored after a while because i was an even worse dm at that time but oh you're very good i did not right now i'm going fucking insane uh why did that stuff not load anyways um what am i thinking yeah i am running uh one shot maybe two shots tomorrow for them fighting theresia oh damn i want to come wait tomorrow it'll it'll be tomorrow what's gonna happen is they're they're not fighting her immediately per se but if you did a session whatever that because that they're in the wode right now and that's they've been trapped in the wode and they didn't know it for like basically the past 10 months oh damn time hasn't passed for them but they're gonna be in there like in the next two weeks okay that would be good do a session that's focused on orton if like round people up for it then those two things will happen at the same time yeah that sounds

[Speaker 4]
great um i have most of next week off um but i'm busy tomorrow let's see if it works this time

[Speaker 1]
put those guys in the thing hey now there's now here we dragons that will be fun all right i'm gonna go back yeah i'm gonna bring us back to the uh other thing and then um ah and i'm gonna grab myself a bite to eat and i'm gonna come back and we're gonna get ready for encounters all right i gotta be done in

[Speaker 4]
about an hour to make pizza dough that's fine that should be fine actually you guys might kill it now

[Speaker 1]
and then if you guys don't kill it then you could you can return to it next session

[Speaker 4]
basically okay all right

[Speaker 2]
what have you been hiding from us what secrets uh i thought i was going insane because i mentioned

[Speaker 1]
a battle map and i was immediately barraged with like 13 questions about whether you guys were fighting a pseudo dragon and i was going to i was contemplating homicide

[Speaker 2]
homicide no but i imagine okay we saved the no no i'm not imagining all right i already

[Speaker 1]
contemplated the homicide so we're going to homicide of us homicide of what like you in real life actually um yep that that's what i was gonna have a sam hyde moment

[Speaker 2]
um good thing i'm using a vpn you pick a name you have you have about a one in seven thousand

[Speaker 6]
chance of you know oh was this discourse sponsored by nord vpn or by a redshot it's not

[Speaker 1]
get some food i'll be back in two-ish minutes and then we'll go to encounter

[Speaker 6]
what for that what do you mean do you want me to find it it's it's basically not concentrating to get that he's gonna destroy him in just unlike kill his father or something and then the kid starts crying of course no it's better than what i described to it uh uh okay that's not okay okay i mean the boss music is not much better it's just wait wait oh it's what was the name of that video i changed the subtitles it looks normal no not in that video it's in like different version i'm gonna find it but not the boss music one okay i found it but the video may be offensive especially to the little kid okay okay that's funny welcome i forgot like one minute it becomes better when they start talking again funny i think that video's actually wasn't the one i was thinking about yeah uh so uh homicide huh wait so by the way are we gonna fight the white dragons before the red dragon

[Speaker 2]
i have no idea i was worried we were gonna kill us so the dragon why are you guys asking that

[Speaker 1]
question it's such a weird question to ask hey are we fighting this are we fighting dragons no that's a dumb question i don't mean to be rude but that is a really tough question it's just really frustrating to interact with like what the fuck are you talking about

[Speaker 2]
hey james i have a dragon immediately you say okay 50 minutes break so i can bring out the battle map yeah i'm getting a battle map ready and i'm like those two things can be disconnected you guys are oh yeah yeah they can definitely be you think the 12 level 8 characters are fighting hey it's a true polymorphed

[Speaker 1]
uh great version do you do you guys do you have an expectation that when you guys meet an encounter i will inform you that the like hey they're the dragon that's bearing down on you is white and of this size category or uh do you think that's information gonna hide from you it depends on the encounter all right all right that was not an answer it's just uh while i was in the middle of like trying to narrate what was happening with the pseudo dragon that just there was like again like 16 different interruptions uh one of which was um i think just ryan talking about his paladin or his god or something and uh that got me inordinately agitated i don't know if any of you guys know can talk to them or know how to talk to them uh he's currently hanging out near chirona kind of like away from the group he's trying doing his best to keep the group in between him and the statue captain willoughby is calling out at this point like we got about uh 15 minutes more for this stop pops like i have a pseudo dragon can i like

[Speaker 2]
bring like the pseudo dragons usually around my shoulder but can it like speak to the one like hey when i joined it when i joined the club i speak for conic too

[Speaker 1]
to yana this okay like understands um understands a little bit they communicate using emotions and thoughts primarily can i ask

[Speaker 2]
my pseudo dragon which you know doesn't understand to communicate to it by thoughts

[Speaker 1]
or like emotions sure it communicates the emotion of like friendliness or welcoming yeah like sensation of emotion and welcoming and the dragon seems relatively interested

[Speaker 2]
it hasn't run off yet i will give it a good berry it's pretty happy

[Speaker 1]
it appreciates me not like you people there we go so here chirona and have chirona and meryl make me your chirona meryl and zakira make me some wait no not chirona just meryl zakira and i guess your companions can do so as well go ahead and make me reception checks all right

[Speaker 3]
19 12.

[Speaker 1]
all right zakira your attention is drawn over to cory who is walking on top of the water it looks like he's walking on top of the water at first and you can see like these little arcane circles are placing themselves before his feet actually touches the water they kind of look like a tensor's floating disc they seem to freeze the water underneath him for

[Speaker 4]
just a second he just kind of oh my god we've been traveling with jesus all this time and we had no

[Speaker 1]
idea he just kind of silently walks back into his tram doesn't really you know say hi to anybody he's on the side of the boat and none of the caravan guards seem to notice him at the moment or any of the other occupants are just kind of looking around meryl you hear the sound of wings uh can i

[Speaker 4]
tell if they're feathery wings or leathery wings with a 19.

[Speaker 1]
a 19 you could tell that they are of a size past which the sound is not really helpfully distinguished between the two

[Speaker 4]
the sound of moving air is more big yeah yeah okay um do i want to yell or do i want to try and like signal people i'm gonna yell um just trouble incoming everybody get down wait cory is out on the water cory has made it back to his tram like his oh good i was gonna yell at him to get get back here specifically but no just troubles incoming everybody get down do i notice it too with a 19

[Speaker 1]
passive perception passive perception uh likely not okay you're engaged in different activity right now like you're talking to the super dragon yeah let's see here let's see here uh

[Speaker 8]
meryl while you're watching what's his face go into activate this here there we go so

[Speaker 1]
go ahead and place yourselves let's see here you'll be on the left bank go and put your tokens on the map and probably on this little brown spot here look at servers are

[Speaker 4]
oh are we on this small side on the boats well the statue wasn't on the boats so oh okay

[Speaker 2]
can my i assume there's a bit of a size difference right click here just right click your token and uh and uh appearance yeah yeah it should be an appearance all right 0.5 let's see 0.5 update token okay that's what size are the others oh one let's see

[Speaker 1]
everybody else is one to one so i don't know what's going on with your character

[Speaker 2]
i am one to one as well but when i'm one to one i'm larger oh the scale is three for some reason okay there we go update token yes i'm correct size now

[Speaker 1]
hyrana has seen a bunch of uh i'll use knights for the disappear i'll have two at the front yeah there's one sitting at the back of the uh oh god uh let's bring this in all right so arona or sorry merrill watches as a red dragon swoops in oh yeah from oh why is he moving so slow he's not supposed to be doing that swoops in from above crashes into his like his feet just plunge into cory's cart and he has cory and the caravan guard in it up okay when it does that um cory and the caravan guard in his grasp and begins flying upwards

[Speaker 4]
oh wow i really hope this is a kidnapping and not a snacking upon how do we

[Speaker 1]
like can we take turns now or is he flying and we're just screwed uh merrill and her band can

[Speaker 2]
take turns because like how do we feel about making them fall into the ground like how are they 30 feet up is that what that sign means 30 feet up yes okay

[Speaker 1]
are we in combat you are in combat go ahead and add yourselves to your initiative

[Speaker 4]
i'm just gonna have the followers act on my initiative if that's cool give me a second

[Speaker 1]
um they do act on your initiative uh there were two encounters for some reason go ahead and fix that 19 and 26 that oh my god didn't work i'm gonna have the guards go on initiative count 20

[Speaker 4]
those guys oh shit wait i need to roll again oh damn that's a shame why am i surrounded with cats exactly as combat begins guys i don't need your help

[Speaker 1]
there we go okay i thought i had already rolled

[Speaker 5]
it's dragon slaying time am i am i too late for it

[Speaker 1]
oh wubba hey it's wubba hey yeah all you need is like 50 gold pieces and you could definitely uh

[Speaker 4]
you definitely be in there 50 gold charging an entry fee yes yeah i can subtract 50

[Speaker 1]
so you were picked up basically on the way back from what is it the vampire's lair is close to a river so you could have been picked up on that river after you just kind of like left a bit like

[Speaker 5]
yeah i'm with it

[Speaker 1]
it's oh that's a perfect explanation if you decided to do a little bit of uh caravan guard work yeah let's take on something a little bit less a little bit less exciting which will be very funny when you for reasons still seeking

[Speaker 5]
where can i find the foundry link it's uh sam hi boogaloo yep in the pin post oh foundry got it so what's happened so far are we mid dragon fight

[Speaker 6]
yeah y'all just started yeah we haven't taken an action yet yeah guess what there are two dragons

[Speaker 2]
right even though the second thing is not a dragon like i think it looks like a shadow black dragon

[Speaker 5]
yeah maybe also what level are these dragons because i might be a little underleveled

[Speaker 1]
don't worry about it no such thing as on the level when you have teamwork yeah they are adult dragons right or no the red one is why are you asking me that question they'll just add no no this is very important i do not like when people just like say hey tell me this tell me this over and over again because that like makes me like how i would know the dragon's age the large let's see here the dragon that you can see in front of you is huge

[Speaker 5]
yep that's enough um i don't know where we're at do i need a roll initiative or are we just

[Speaker 1]
chilling right now go ahead and add initiative add your target to the uh add your token to the board here and i'm going to place it on one of these uh you can place it on one of these

[Speaker 6]
things here by the way how to check the initiative of everybody so no one is my turn

[Speaker 1]
it's in the second tab for combat encounters you have an initiative of 15

[Speaker 6]
yeah this

[Speaker 5]
goodbye my dearly love zane you will burn to a crisp

[Speaker 1]
pretty good very good and then go ahead and pick one of these be here he would have had oh he would have had time oh there we go so he's going to be one of the caravan guards go ahead and pick a place to add him to or pick one of these um boats to add him to um

[Speaker 5]
he's a wimp so he'll probably be in the back all right that's probably probably right can i add him there right here

[Speaker 1]
yeah yeah that's perfect so the second cart from the second boat from the top just got destroyed pretty completely uh the dragon more or less just landed on it picked up two people and it's begun flying upwards okay i don't love that i don't think anybody does so first turn on the board is going to be evelyn

[Speaker 2]
oh yes okay um how do we feel about making the guy fall in the water like it should be fine

[Speaker 1]
everyone you've had plenty of time to talk about that by now you gotta decide okay uh i

[Speaker 2]
sure i cast i used the uh temporal stasis momentary stasis it needs to make a dc 15

[Speaker 8]
all right are you going to ping that in the chat or oh sure not i don't know if i

[Speaker 1]
did that sound it it did good yeah if then preferably just do this in foundry so i can actually like flick the button for it i'm going to click on this now

[Speaker 2]
uh celebrity barbs are you casting that first level yes all right holy shit okay yeah that's that's that turn all right that brings us to zane

[Speaker 5]
man sorry i was reading something in my profile um describe the scene to me um did i just hop into the middle or something or um so you've been chilling on a guard caravan or chilling as a

[Speaker 1]
guard on this caravan for a little while you got picked up uh with a bunch of rat catchers many of whom you actually recognize from sierra's keep and you decide that pays decent enough you get to avoid the vampire's tomb for a little while and anything that might be hiding underneath of it and in the you know for the past few days strange things have been happening there's a mist that's been crowding around the boats restricting visibility to only 60 feet which reminds me everybody go ahead and right click your tokens go to vision and set your vision range to 60 feet

[Speaker 2]
right but then i need to remake my turn because i need to walk towards it first right because it's more than uh no you would just we would just move your

[Speaker 1]
character closer okay within 30 so it could be within 60 feet yeah redo the entire turn thank you let's see what was it didn't reduce it for me at all yeah i think it might be token vision i wonder token vision is not activated but ah there it is turn off fog exploration i do i guess i shouldn't do there we go everything's black and white now

[Speaker 4]
though okay well shit would we have even seen that yeah i'll say like the mist initially came down

[Speaker 5]
gotcha um can i hear this attack can i hear the roar of the dragon absolutely okay i'm going to prepare to cast um charm monster if the dragon enters my line of sight perfect let me make sure if charm a monster has that range um see within range yes okay so that is my turn

[Speaker 1]
oh thank you excellent there we go so wherever he flies i can basically put a um have it clear the mist in a certain area cool all right so you're going to use charm monster can you ping that in the chat for me hello he's talking to the lava yeah it's your

[Speaker 5]
turn oh i said i was going to prepare to cast charm monster and that's my turn if you're preparing to cast it yeah if it enters my field of range what's there what's the range on this 60 feet it's 60 feet okay so it has to get closer all right and you're not moving right now i apologize it is 30 feet for charm monster um and i am not moving i'm just chilling on the boat

[Speaker 7]
i totally understand oh all right where oh was am i supposed to be here why is everyone

[Speaker 1]
black and white let's go to hey what did we like go over like six times already i i just got back here i was no no i just got back i okay give me a second it's a noble session but hey can you hear me okay i've asked you like six times now please ask questions in the fucking chat all right i'm sorry what is is there any particular reason that you decided to like interrupt it again no there is no reason okay because i keep hearing you say things that i think you're reading off a script from ifunny or like destiny voice chats during the fucking session while people are talking i just really want to reinforce that i've said multiple times that i don't like this i don't want you to do this i would like to clarify now that it makes me not want to play with you and given that i that's happened normally i would do like a couple of warnings beforehand i feel like i've already had kind of adequate warnings so far uh if you do it again i'm just removing you you're welcome to rejoin when you feel like you're ready to uh i don't know talk division yeah okay is he coming back or did you murder him uh he'll be coming back at some point i think okay big uh maybe not we'll see anyways all right hey

[Speaker 4]
all right um the sheets for the followers are blank so i'm just gonna say they got left at home

[Speaker 1]
um i'm gonna fire off a guy just add their damage to whatever it is that you do so like if you hit um you would add like a d8 plus four for the or sorry d8 plus three for jamie or sorry it's jamie no jack can or julian whatever the j name is and then you would add for instance like a cantrip for random maybe something else yeah i guess another cantrip for cane oh which i definitely did not hit that if it keeps the resolution simple okay

[Speaker 4]
um i have bonus action uh no sorry i have sanctuary which is a bonus action however it's a range of 30 feet so never mind right you did cast a spell with your action um oh that's right i forgot about that i love mold spell i always get those wires crossed

[Speaker 2]
all right that's it for me brings us to tiana okay hell yeah uh first off uh stalkers flurry and i'm going to combine that with action action search to first make five normal attacks and i'm going to use a sharp shooter for every single one uh i can't use sharp shooter in the role

[Speaker 1]
so subtract five from every attack row sure you can use if you're rolling it in your um

[Speaker 2]
oh because you're rolling the boundary okay uh and then i'm going to add the precision attack to the uh 16 well 16 would be an 11 right uh yeah wait i'm sorry i can't think i will add precision attack to 20 uh yes subtract five from everything i want okay so we have the 20

[Speaker 1]
let's see here the 31 hits the 20 reduced to 15 misses yes reduced to eight misses 20 reduces

[Speaker 2]
okay uh so um one hit right or two uh 15 plus five uh one hit it has a it has a number class of 19 okay looks like one yes and then uh two special ones they do an extra d8 of damage due to stalkers flurry okay okay so how many that's uh and then 26 you have three hits three hits so that's roll and how many two of those are crits oh god uh i was not uh critical damage for one normal one crit damage there you go uh while you're rolling up those

[Speaker 1]
stuff i'm gonna have be here 56 does that mean five and three or i can't this is really

[Speaker 2]
frustrating um just damage um uh that's a super crit so that's well let's see here

[Speaker 1]
verona you could go ahead and take your turn while this is getting rolled yes okay i'm still

[Speaker 6]
thinking um so yeah we can't see the other dragon just lost can i hit him with a 30 feet spell if i move closer to dragon or is he too high up if you get to within 30 feet and he's like

[Speaker 1]
30 feet up i'm not gonna make you do the uh hunger the prat what was his name i can't remember i can't remember i'm not gonna make you do uh a what is it a square plus b squared minus c squared whatever i can't remember what it is okay

[Speaker 2]
yeah was 88 damage the total or was that the last roll yes uh that's the yeah you know one attack

[Speaker 1]
no uh the total is 88 damage cool cool cool so i already did 52 of that so then we'll do uh 36 okay so i'm not he's gonna make this easier on you you use the legendary action to you move closer hey

[Speaker 6]
love that okay it's okay um i'm gonna spend one key point and attack him with uh i don't think that can hit him radiance on both okay i am gonna use a bit that's just the damage you need to roll the attack it did yeah we didn't have an attack when i clicked it it only had damage not sure why it would just be use your dex modifier so

[Speaker 1]
we just slash roll oh here we go well natural 19 is gonna beat it no matter what so that'll be

[Speaker 6]
okay as a bonus section i'm gonna activate the what's the name of that thing that is called the tool it's yeah i'm activating the eldritch

[Speaker 1]
small feature it's when you take the attack action it's that's a bonus action not i did no no and so the thing i'm trying to tell you is you have a you have an extra attack at this level

[Speaker 6]
yeah but i don't want to spend two key points for that

[Speaker 1]
so that's why okay i can't i can't choose the only attack once it's certainly fine

[Speaker 6]
all right yeah but i'm activating the eldritch quota to bonus thing so that's my turn like actually i'm gonna move a little bit for the relay

[Speaker 8]
oh all right that brings us to

[Speaker 1]
another legendary action would be pretty funny

[Speaker 2]
oh stop moving closer to my that's a that's a big boy

[Speaker 1]
oh god i can't see it which one of you wants to die today oh wait a second is it the it's the wing flat thing no he's just he's moving yeah all right go ahead zekir okay

[Speaker 3]
i'm gonna actually just go all out uh calculations might take a second i'm going to fire this motherfucker fire it let me also cast a zephyr strike and okay i'm ready god damn it

[Speaker 1]
i'm just gonna get something ready here someone is damn you are rich

[Speaker 9]
and it crits

[Speaker 3]
all right it's all up to you buddy okay so how do i modify all this damage because i can't actually roll the damage on the weapon i have to on the arrow um you double the dice so how many dice are you rolling i'm rolling i've rolled two 1d4 and 6d10 god wow 44 did you say two of 1d4 or did you say 1d4 i said 1d4 and 6d10 okay because 1d4 bludgeoning 6010 okay

[Speaker 1]
wait no that's god okay i got this and then we're gonna do another wait no because we need another uh 6010 why don't i put that down

[Speaker 3]
and then i need a 1d8 force from zephyr strike all right so that would be

[Speaker 2]
i feel like this guy's gonna gonna yeah that's fire breath is very like it that's scary

[Speaker 3]
all right and that's my that's my first attack of the of the turn

[Speaker 1]
all righty so that's grand total of 82 damage yo i knew it

[Speaker 3]
oh i've been waiting for this bro oh yeah you said that you were gonna do the crit now quick

[Speaker 1]
question does that do anything to adjacent characters okay hey um i feel like we talked

[Speaker 3]
about that uh yes it does 1d10 to enemies within five feet of impact uh oh it's a mad like a fantastic i thought you said this thing was a bomb oh you know it's a short range bomb pocket nuke i can't believe i actually uh saved myself by uh by coding that all right so no

[Speaker 1]
no the exposure is not targeted exclusive the alchemical bomb is not targeted exclusively to people that you don't like uh yeah so i feel like 17 to the guard i'm just gonna knock him out and by knocked out just he's not going to be doing attacks same for meryl 17 to meryl and then 17 to name evelyn for novelty but it was five foot

[Speaker 2]
i'm it's 10 foot up he's standing right next to you

[Speaker 3]
yeah 10 foot in the air oh and james the uh dragon could have made a go ahead uh the dragon could have made a dex saving throw the difficulty check is 27 but it's a critical so it's probably come on what's the dc uh 27 27 and what is that wait why is the dc 27 uh because the difficulty check is equivalent to the attack roll

[Speaker 1]
ah okay um yeah okay all right now back to you attack this is supposed to be 10 feet up so meryl evelyn oh my oh how much damage was it the night 17 oh and also uh what's his face cory uh cory gets cory has been limp uh he takes that damage and i'm gonna roll this privately what happens he stirs for a moment and then just like goes back almost asleep oh man you're rolling 2d8 for that uh for that long bow shoot

[Speaker 3]
oh you're just really good at rolling all right that's gonna be all of that

[Speaker 5]
you've earned yourself a bardic inspiration die

[Speaker 1]
oh what wait is the question is the what's the second da coming from uh the second da

[Speaker 3]
is coming from my gloomstalker passive we're on my second attack yep so it's pretty good for me i can i can move out right i could just you know do this yeah no you can you can choose to move out it doesn't hasn't actually happened yet okay uh so that's my turn um good luck guys

[Speaker 2]
i love you all you could have stabbed me you're evil oh no you could have that one sorry

[Speaker 1]
oh okay where is my fire breath all right so we got a dc 17 um wait why did i say something it was dc 21 dexterity save and throw scroll up a little bit in the chat you'll see it um for 62 fire damage save for half um but blood cook what was the dc 21 okay

[Speaker 2]
that's a lot of damage it is but it's hard because of fire resistance because of the drug we used oh you have a drug that you uh it's called like a wait sorry let me check the name it's like a marosa balm marosa balm marosa balm wait uh dnd beyond oh my god it's a balm why am i thinking your uh fire resistance costs 100 gp bought it like for a couple of days ago so how much damage 62 62 divided by two it's 31 damaged both of us it's in peace evelyn does that one down uh down yes unconscious yeah just had 31 hp

[Speaker 1]
all right still waiting on checks from

[Speaker 7]
zavara i already did my dexterity check what's the oh there we go it's a line i got a nine but i'm a t flying so i take half damage anyways

[Speaker 1]
you're resistant to fire yeah so it's like minus just minus 31

[Speaker 7]
yeah and i already did the damage too

[Speaker 1]
epic all right and then it's gonna do here this is tricky because he just i do not want him taking an attack of opportunity from meryl is he looking hot he has to what he's not looking too good i think what he has to do is he has to do the uh he's got to go oh one last thing uh in that fire breath was mr uh what's his face in that fire breath was mr cory the 2d8 force damage was he would have been under the dragon yeah but you can just like lift a claw kind of like you're shish kabobbing somebody oh my god you don't have to describe

[Speaker 2]
oh resting piece well you asked

[Speaker 1]
brutal hell it's like some magic is activated on cory but it's not a too many things are happening at the moment to see exactly what so we're gonna turn that off that area is on fire but surely there's a way i could decrease the intensity of these extra opacity there we go that's not what i wanted that area is currently burning here yep i'm gonna have him do the wing beat attack because otherwise meryl could kill him that would be bad all right let's see here everyone is going to automatically fail and take one death save

[Speaker 2]
wait what kind of damage is it it's bludgeoning yes uh it's bludgeoning uh hell yeah i take no damage okay like like entropy immunity to non-magical uh bludgeoning piercing and slashing damage from non-magical attacks that aren't silvered it's one are you a lightning throw item lorkhan's fang you approved it orkins uh let me scroll down uh harkins bite

[Speaker 1]
okay uh you're punched at the moment anyway so i guess it doesn't matter all that much probably somebody's gonna kill you next round hopefully did you roll damage for that james i did not damage all right little 19 bludgeoning and he's going to move up 40 feet don't let it get away he's gonna look she'll leave the night there and do i have any wait no that was his legendary action all right that just took irona

[Speaker 5]
no crit and third level

[Speaker 2]
rest in peace mr dragon i mean i have to do shit yeah just having a nice vacation on the floor

[Speaker 4]
a ground and because of spell sniper its range is actually actually 60 feet

[Speaker 1]
oh okay okay i was just looking something up all right so i oh you got a critical fucking nice

[Speaker 4]
i felt safe assuming that a 31 would hit he is nearly dead thank you for all that damage all right anything else to do on your turn don't think i have anything else that i can

[Speaker 1]
do you want to like have your your sprite go into melee combat with them

[Speaker 4]
a little fisticuffs actually um my sprite has um yeah

[Speaker 1]
oh you just add his damage to whatever your attack was okay oh i think yeah if i remember

[Speaker 4]
correctly it's exactly one point of damage because it's a tiny little pixie bow

[Speaker 3]
it could fall asleep

[Speaker 4]
okay so go ahead and roll that con save it's theoretically impossible oh holy

[Speaker 1]
all righty uh does kairon ever want to move do anything else

[Speaker 4]
no i'll stick where i am okay we come we come down to my boy i can't i couldn't see that guy

[Speaker 1]
before nope he is moving 80 feet down that's okay so remember how we went over he just dropped out of the sky okay yes okay here you go fly down where he's been lying in wait and he's gonna

[Speaker 3]
breathe and that's pretty much all he's got breathing is illegal indeed oh well

[Speaker 1]
rest in peace i'm not seeing tiana's health changed on the on the boundary

[Speaker 2]
uh it's not okay she's on 34 and she got a good one 25 but is it not oh what oh the other characters synced i don't know why tiana's didn't okay 34

[Speaker 1]
34 now 25 is definitely a success 17 just fails and kairona fails how much damage is it is 43 necrotic

[Speaker 6]
uh um i take half damage because of the evasion feature oh yeah even if i fail

[Speaker 1]
i saw that man a lot of months

[Speaker 2]
34 13 every

[Speaker 1]
all right it's all the way down to zavora

[Speaker 7]
all right so i'm gonna go here i'm going to use this or just lay on hands on novelty yeah yeah uh that's an action though do you have healing

[Speaker 2]
word otherwise you could do that as a bonus action and still have your action i do not

[Speaker 1]
have fortunately everyone can't comment on this fact because everyone is unconscious

[Speaker 2]
yeah tiana is alive

[Speaker 7]
uh-uh i did not have the way uh no i do not have okay feeling word i did much appreciated

[Speaker 1]
how do i cast lay on hand um that's your push i don't think we've had anybody do it in ages

[Speaker 7]
okay well maybe merrill i'm going to heal i'm going to use 20

[Speaker 1]
oh yeah thank you does he have that lay on hands pool inside your character sheet yeah you could just whatever you give her you could just subtract from the yeah the thing on the left i just saw it updated in foundry that's perfect ah yes lay on hands that one fucking

[Speaker 7]
healing ability so take that as healing

[Speaker 2]
oh yes i'm it still says i'm rolling death saves i'm unsure how to get rid of it

[Speaker 1]
oh okay you shouldn't be unconscious anymore

[Speaker 7]
and then i will then move like 10 feet up here and what can i do for both i i will cast shield of faith on myself so there's that very good and that's my turn

[Speaker 2]
all right that will bring us to evelyn oh thank okay this dragon has it coming what's the range there we go i'm going to cast sleet storm on the red dragon and for further notice that the sleet storm has been modified with modify spell to only target enemies sure let's see it's a 40 foot uh 40 20 foot tall and 40 foot radius so let's see how i do this uh wait where did you cast modify spell uh like uh you mean create this i have a no it's a modify spell i uh the ring of spell storing so i cast before the longer is finished i cast uh okay never mind uh it's it's a 40 foot okay is there a way to like just there we go okay yeah if you do it in foundry then i did it in fabric i'm doing it in fabric perfect uh yeah and um yes so the dragon does not need to make a saving throw yet and then i'm going to move this way and apparently it didn't move there we go um and uh yes that's my oh wait yeah is he gonna make a save on the start of his turn uh when he yes so yeah at the start of his turn or when he enters it on a turn and this does not count as our so yes at the start of his turn

[Speaker 1]
yeah that's my turn okay let's go to

[Speaker 5]
we got zane tell you what would you like yes sir uh so zane is going to try to run along the ships um would you i i'm not sure of the setup here can zane walk on this

[Speaker 1]
let me go to my oh yeah he could traverse anywhere between these ships here okay the idea is that it's kind of set up like a train cars almost like perfect

[Speaker 5]
got it is the ship ahead of me on fire or is that another ship it's not on fire it was just their dragon landed on it gotcha gotcha so there's still some bits that you could like you know

[Speaker 1]
got you oh wait no no i i was looking at the wrong guy this guy this one in front of you

[Speaker 5]
is not destroyed at all it's the one that's second from the top up here perfect so i moved 30 feet and i can't see anything so as my action i'm gonna dash and take another 30 feet okay and we'll go right here and i still can't see anything so i in my turn hold on a second

[Speaker 1]
let me i never moved the bubble because those guys can see you see him now

[Speaker 5]
yeah but um my character can't see him so

[Speaker 1]
uh i in my turn well no your character should be able to see him is the idea

[Speaker 5]
um he's not within 60 feet and there's like this right miss but the the 60 feet thing is an

[Speaker 1]
account of the mist around you and the dragon that's flying is blowing away the mist oh lovely

[Speaker 5]
okay well i did use my action as a dash so i do in my turn but i will fuck them up next round

[Speaker 1]
would that have would that have changed your approaches if you could uh would you still dash if you could have seen them no then yeah i'll happily let you uh recall that one because thank

[Speaker 5]
you that's 80 feet um see what i got here um yeah i'm gonna say okay here we go i have hypnotic pattern i'm gonna roll it at third level it's a range of 120 yes and it allows me to cast a 30 foot cube i'm gonna do it right here on the dragon uh so that is a wisdom saving throw dc 16 we believe we believe okay go ahead and say what kind of character are you i am a college of glamour bard my whole class around charming

[Speaker 1]
go ahead and make me a uh this will basically function as an arcana you got to make an arcana check or you could make a check that will treat as arcana by making like a spell attack roll oh i got you i'm gonna whisper something to you then when you see okay

[Speaker 5]
okay here so that's the first thing all right he does pass he does but go ahead and make me that check um gotcha an arcana yes yep arcana where you can use your spell attack roll i'll use my spell attack roll which is a plus eight i believe there should be around plus eight or plus nine at this level i will roll a d20 and we'll just add a plus eight if you accept that perfect yeah

[Speaker 1]
i can check the thing now there's my 20 oh perfect okay i'm gonna drag you into the other channel for a second

[Speaker 5]
what you got for me james

[Speaker 1]
all right so you have maybe seen the symbol of the green god before you've been around some for a while uh probably not as familiar with the rest of you as they're probably not as familiar yeah i'm throwing like a bunch of proper nouns at you you see a symbol manifest out of these out of these little hypnotic lines that are just kind of like dragging throughout the uh throughout space like like vector art basically and all scintillating patterns and stuff like that are buzzing around this thing's head it's not concerned until right in front of its face you see you notice so all this happens in like the blink of an eye but it's your spell and you have like an innate knowledge of it a mask of these lines manifests on its face that looks smooth like no lips no nose no ears with the exception of elkhorns coming out where the eyes are supposed to be

[Speaker 5]
oh and it falls the dragon falls the dragon falls interesting interesting okay um would my character know anything about what this mask is

[Speaker 1]
it's a the mask only appears for a second and it looks like it manifests as part of the spell uh based on your check you could guess that this is probably the effect of a curse that you've activated in some way either you've activated it or the dragon's done it or somebody

[Speaker 5]
else has interesting okay um is this dragon prone he is now cool all right um when i go back into the channel what do i mention any of this you can you're free to mention anything

[Speaker 1]
i've told you probably after the battle and then as far as crosstalk goes it's like as much as you can fit into like six seconds i don't mind people discussing a little bit of tactics i just don't want them to especially when we have so many people um right it doesn't we're about to end

[Speaker 5]
the session anyway so it doesn't matter all that much you can't see anybody in the character wise i can't see anyone anyways so um i'll just keep quiet no worries all right uh see you in the

[Speaker 2]
other channel see you then you are much louder for some reason i'll just lower you individually

[Speaker 5]
it's fine there we go zane died i'm kidding what what killed insulate all right so anyways the

[Speaker 1]
dragon uh was initially unfazed by the hypnotic pattern and then it just fell so the dragon is hello what i feel we've been over this like 80 times

[Speaker 2]
but it's hey it's it looks like it's downed it has a it has an unconscious symbol next to it

[Speaker 1]
yeah yeah and that's something that if you really need to know right the second i still had one

[Speaker 4]
until recently what is the big orange circle surrounding the dragon

[Speaker 2]
fleet storm which only affects enemies so you don't have to worry about it

[Speaker 4]
all right merrill it is your turn how did you i'm gonna kick this i'm gonna kick this puppy's ass

[Speaker 1]
all righty are you rolling to subdue the dragon or to kill him um i was gonna roll to kill it's

[Speaker 4]
definitely unfriendly do i get oh it doesn't matter if i get advantage you do have advantage though

[Speaker 8]
i'll roll again to see if i grit nope so close oh my things just goes down trying to see

[Speaker 4]
if it's the regular damage or the versatile that's more damage oh there we go

[Speaker 1]
all right yeah it should be a one if you're doing it two hands it should be 1d 10 yep all right it's unconscious so that's a crit i should have i wanted to specify that when you

[Speaker 4]
rolling again too all right how would merrill like to do this um just two hands on on the hilt and straight blade straight down into the skull all righty very good okay so you just overhand

[Speaker 1]
in one hit while this thing is down there's a bunch of ice floating around you or falling around you i should say uh it's obscure it's difficult to see but like this thing is i you cannot possibly miss and you cleave straight through its skull so and i bet the ice lights up cool yes it does everybody on the outside they don't see they see you go into the sleep they don't see you until the uh until the thing they still can't even technically see you they just see a light source and for a brief flash it just immediately opens up that's cool and you watch as a bunch of little ember the dragon seems to deflate a little bit you just watch these ember particles start leaving its body floating upwards did we just kill a fucking balloon i don't let it flee

[Speaker 5]
oh how could you have hunted yo gg on that anything else to do with your turn

[Speaker 4]
and tiana's on deck um i used a melee attack so i can cast a cantrip correct that's correct all right let me check range real quick yep i will toll the dead on the shadow dragon lovely although it's necrotic damage i was just about to say i think it's mean that

[Speaker 1]
you could have came to what's it called i think uh i'll make a deck save this cane i think has access to i can't remember it sacred flame yeah it's not gonna hit anyways

[Speaker 4]
all right so that's the end of my turn all right

[Speaker 1]
that brings to tiana and then daiko is up afterwards okay uh we zoom up here

[Speaker 2]
and since that dragon is no longer an issue we're going to fire three attacks on the shadow dragon the crossbow expert an extra attack uh sharpshooter on all three what oh god okay so one of the sit right here all of them have sharpshooter 12 13

[Speaker 3]
and the 27 would hit yeah okay then we can wait you can use sharpshooter on multiple attacks in the same turn yeah 27 damage okay i've been severely under using sharpshooter then because i've been using it for the first okay i'll keep that in mind uh yeah it's your i think i think

[Speaker 1]
it was zephyr strike where only applies the damage on the attack that gives you advantage

[Speaker 2]
oh right wait roll 1d4 uh actually three extra damage

[Speaker 3]
i have a useless little 1d4 as well yeah zephyr strike it only works for one attack but i mean

[Speaker 1]
that one attack is fucking yeah i mean it played out earlier didn't it yeah that's my turn all right daiko and then zekir is on deck i don't think these guys have frightening presence do they oh nice no it's not flying no oh you're free to ask questions like on your turn that's that's totally fine oh okay okay yeah you can use all your attacks on it 0.6 hits five damage he's stunning oh i have to click this there we go nice he fails oh hell yeah he does not have i can't find my stun all right so your next attacks against this guy have advantage and he is stunned until the end of your next turn they're stunned so you have an extra attack that you can use so you can make two attacks now you're at this level you could make two attacks plus you have your bonus action that you could also use to make an attack

[Speaker 8]
16 16 does miss 25 hits

[Speaker 1]
when does kairana go up uh any time you roll uh yeah so you just roll normally for damage question uh it kind of seems like it's taking a little bit less damage on account of the light situation well you did flurry of blows so you have let's see here you did that unarmed strike and then if you did flurry of blows that means you have two attacks they have but not extra so go ahead and roll you roll another attack and then if you hit that'll be your damage oh all right re-roll that damage

[Speaker 9]
yo

[Speaker 1]
come on he didn't even roll that at advantage either even better all right so it looks like it's doing like again but there's this weird shadow stuff around it um just kind of seems it feels like you're trying to hit fog but you hit but you absolutely connected on that last state that brings us to zakira all right so quick question do i get

[Speaker 3]
advantage or was it only him because the dragon's stunned i don't know the rules everybody gets

[Speaker 1]
everybody gets advantage on stun creatures okay this guy is stunned until the end of not his next turn until the end of uh daikos next turn kind of hugging it out here where is your bet

[Speaker 3]
insert knock this dragon it has stealth proficiency um just do that for the additional damage all right the dragon drops it's close we're gonna use my uh what's the name sharpshooter did i actually just miss you literally just barely missed yeah all right um yeah triple advantage i know it's crazy in it uh is there anything else i could do uh no that is gonna be my turn all right close this out

[Speaker 1]
and this is it's that later this one wait do you still only have one attack

[Speaker 3]
yeah oh shit i'm sorry i i for our next level is gonna be a big power spike

[Speaker 5]
huh what's your class here probably multi-classed yeah yeah but i thought he was battle master

[Speaker 1]
yeah i am battle master what i'm gonna move away because she doesn't have to

[Speaker 3]
worry about thanks for opportunity i don't get extra attack until fifth level

[Speaker 1]
and she's gonna do all right she's gonna do a fifth level witch bolt

[Speaker 2]
so let's don't kill the god with your pet

[Speaker 1]
it's not letting me cast of it all right that's pretty annoying but do it this other way because i can't over what i missed pack magic hey uh so i was just getting ready to cast uh witch bolt at this guy and i was gonna give uh daiko a fifth level uh pack magic slot

[Speaker 4]
okay you're back so we're level spell slot yeah i don't have fifth level spell slots yes you do i have some things that are fifth level but i don't cast them from spell slots

[Speaker 1]
here let me uh i will i'll be happy to explain after the uh after the thing i i see yeah i didn't finish your turn or even roll for anything so you're free to uh you're free to do your thing this guy is currently stoned by the way he's stunned i'm moving closer do i get advantage

[Speaker 4]
for him being stunned you you sure do i still don't think 17 just barely misses

[Speaker 8]

we'll see if you hit smoke first but um absolutely it's gonna it's not gonna be happy

[Speaker 7]
about it okay so and can i divine smite twice in one turn with multi-attack you could

[Speaker 7]
yep but yes you can every time you hit you can divine smite all right let's find my attack

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 7]
i will roll it again nope and then and then i do damage then i will cast divine smite for some extra damage oh wait a second and then apply half then uh if it's not dead i will do it again

[Speaker 9]
he's definitely not dead all right it's a call to your pet advantage

[Speaker 7]
advantage all right that was max damage on that smite that time very good oh and then i also have an one one more thing i have a poor master and i can like do a bonus above your weapon yeah yeah

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 3]
of killing it nobody i request to kill it it is a dragon yes wonderful i hate dragons seriously come on my dog likes dragons though he likes them for for lunch yeah we we have a

[Speaker 2]
dragon for lunch i'm going to be joining that dragon as well uh that dog drinking a dragon's

[Speaker 1]
blood is very healthy but we don't have to drink a shadow dragon evelyn and you still have a prone condition on there so i'm going to fix that i don't know why it's still on there can i roll

[Speaker 2]
perception to see if the dragon looks hurt or something like nothing if it takes an action

[Speaker 1]
okay like referencing the the fourth edition condition we're like it's that's that's how i describe things that appear to be about points okay

[Speaker 2]
a fourth level sleep perhaps um i'm not sure why not for fun and giggles i'm upcasting sleep to uh hell no i'm not i'll cast uh damn i'm not sure i'm of much use here yeah sure let's just bless uh vsp i don't know i'll bless uh tiana uh and then the people close by here no tiana zavara and

[Speaker 1]
psycho are all blessed that means you add 1d4 to all ability checks attack rolls and savings

[Speaker 5]
yep please knock it out and that's my turn all right brings us to zane hi um i am going to move my character here and oh god what happened um there we go i'm still unfamiliar with foundry why do this without charming the rest of you um that's not a bad thing though right it just won't attack you it will and in passive oh okay hero um i will cast hypnotic adren

[Speaker 1]
at the third level you could totally place that in a way that doesn't hit your allies yep i know it's not like giving you that option based on like where the edge of the box is uh

[Speaker 5]
here we go i can just do fails now um something i forgot to mention is i do have a magical item that makes any charming spells the d the saving throw is rolled at disadvantage and i forgot to mention that oh i will keep that in mind um how much works would he have done oh okay the dc is 16 did he fail he fails lovely so he is incapacitated and his speed is zero all right oh and the combat there then and um he is functionally helpless

[Speaker 1]
and he is charmed oh he's charmed okay yep to me not the other party who's who's a good boy

[Speaker 5]
or girl and uh with a bonus and i really can't do anything i'll end my turn

[Speaker 8]
that's fine the combat is over as you have ended the combat by um screwing this guy the squishy bard helped yay

[Speaker 1]
he'd like have his hit points left at the point where she's like stunned and stuff like you guys wrap them heavy chains or get a bunch of stuff together or just group up around him and attack at once and he's actually infested helpless to say i'm so glad i could help

[Speaker 5]
i am an unsung hero as all this has happened on the boat far away from the characters we'll see

[Speaker 2]
see here all righty what's the party up to and we like you talked about like chaining the dragon i would like to be the one to do that or make sure that's done

[Speaker 1]
so the most important thing is he's like charmed by mr for one minute

[Speaker 5]
for one minute right concentration he is incapacitated as long as i concentrate yep through the the other feature you guys are gonna restrain or hypnotic pattern lasts for one minute concentration up to one minute okay so we've been over this like three times now no the one minute was new to me he for one minute yeah yeah no for you guys are what what are you trying to say i think they want to wrap him in a chain within a minute yeah no that's totally fine

[Speaker 1]
and i stunned and he is hypnotic pattern that's why i said earlier he is stunned and hypnotic pattern which means he is helpless and you guys could do whatever you wanted to him

[Speaker 5]
yep that we do can i ask the captain of the boat to steer me to shore or maybe there's a like a transport boat that they could take him for uh yeah it's kind of like hitched along the side

[Speaker 1]
uh he tapped like one of the crew members one of the caravan guards just kind of unthinkingly just staring at the scene that's played out before them just drops the dinghy and gives you the uh gives

[Speaker 5]
you the paddles lovely zane yes he would be more like a kayak or canoe zane's very fragile and weak we'll say this takes a while for him to get to shore so feel free to do whatever you want i'll be there within like a couple of minutes it's gonna help you out oh okay cool but that's uh

[Speaker 4]
you take this at your own speed i will make sure to harvest some body parts from the dragon yes

[Speaker 1]
which one are you working on the red one all righty you're 22 during this break i'm on a user restroom break in combat rather so i'm gonna bring up a bunch of stuff here uh camera you could keep rolling as you wish i go let's see here probably for a dragon probably going to be more towards arcana

[Speaker 3]
could do survival could do nature hey james how much hp did that dragon have the red one

[Speaker 1]
uh the adult red had like 258 or something and i chunked it for like a third mm-hmm no because you did 82 you either did 82 or 92

[Speaker 3]
i think it was 82 for the first hit yeah i think it was 82 but you forgot to add the 10 from sharpshooter because i remember using sharpshooter as well but it's fine i should

[Speaker 1]
probably mention that you can you can when you roll you can add the 10 from sharpshooter into the roll all right because you'll do something like um on a roll like bite and then i click on damage it'll give me the option for situational bonuses and i could just do 10 so if i roll

[Speaker 3]
sharpshooter into a crit right it's still 10 damage so okay so it's just 10 it's not 20 boosted to 20 all right right only the dice good not nice doubled only the dice not flat not mounts

[Speaker 1]
all right that adult red dragon is going to be all harvested out

[Speaker 2]
and i would like to drink some of its blood what kind of fucking edgelord is this hey okay it's yeah i do that you need to be sensitive to other people's culture

[Speaker 3]
yeah yeah don't worry i'll join you in the blood communion hell yeah that's a future reference you

[Speaker 1]
have to let me know when you're purchasing your rosa bomb and also when you are applying it because that fire resistance lasts for an hour and you were here for let's see here what's uh about 96 hours across the course of this journey 90 oh yeah oh yeah you guys are spending days out

[Speaker 2]
here i mean would assume i would have put it on before but yeah i'll mention it before uh before what like stepping into land to the dragon no when we were freeing the venomling because dragon right okay i mean

[Speaker 1]
that's i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go back and change it now because it's already happened

[Speaker 3]
but it's like yeah i will so james i will join fallen in drinking this this dragon's blood hesitantly no one's forcing you well no one's forcing me but force myself so

[Speaker 1]
wow what's the closest one we'll use these guys i'll try to take some points

[Speaker 3]
okay so uh yeah so about like uh how we're gonna divide the loot that's that's gonna be a fun conversation to have probably not gonna drop a fucking like it's probably not gonna have anything on it except like harvestables i doubt it's filled with gems on the inside gem art solid diamond the size if it's a solid diamond heart i'm taking it i'm gonna i'm gonna be a filthy filthy hoarder pulls out crossbow also crossbow dog tackles you to the ground hey you need to beat my ac all right you're fucking crits no no no because i said so

[Speaker 2]
silvery barbs double crits no man that has actually happened to me really sucks it wasn't an enemy who crit at 19 but still 1d4 scale

[Speaker 1]
so four scales for daiko four scales i'm gonna hold on uh carona and um carona and daiko are harvesting here

[Speaker 2]
yeah we're in the blood drinking squad oh yeah blood yeah signature look signature look of

[Speaker 1]
superiority let's see here yes you did in fact get an egg well unfortunately the heart is missing it will give me an egg and then if you'd like you can take some of the see here if you'd like you can take some of the uh yeah you guys can team up to

[Speaker 3]
take lengths of hide okay question does this dragon blood like could i make a roll to figure out if this dragon's blood has a maybe unique properties to it it was healthy something

[Speaker 1]
like that in downtime all right we already drank it

[Speaker 3]
i get fucking blood poisoning from this shit god i hope not

[Speaker 1]
oh this is fun oh crap uh carona did you wait did you guys who did the one session with the fucking did you guys who did the vampire session did you do that yesterday the day before that was yesterday yes that was yesterday all right i need to mark it on the anytime we do a session start or something we got to mark it on that calendar um especially for

[Speaker 4]
it was wednesday was it yes wednesday because it got delayed because of work for me

[Speaker 1]
see here there's so many notes on this one thing here it's gonna be 12 13 session what was the name of the character who was killed um silma so i'll just click save there well he will be back the question is as a player character is something else almost seven days next saturday eight nine ten and this one but uh so somewhere in between these 10 days it could be turned already this problem what you view as a problem we view as a an op

[Speaker 2]
sure well i hope so it's not my character so what do you think about it the question is

[Speaker 4]
are any of these guys participating in the rescue me yes if depending on when when it is

[Speaker 2]
um it's gonna be late next week when is it late you mean like later tonight or late like no late in the week like okay okay yeah yeah yep that works yeah it works well i'm on vacation

[Speaker 4]
all right we seem pretty much done so i'm gonna hop off the call now

[Speaker 1]
hmm oh uh barb when you get the chance to log into your referee account and just look at one of the new notes that i brought up there

[Speaker 4]
okay um like on the tomb page or where it'll be on the simple calendar okay got it

[Speaker 1]
as you guys recall it is a time sensitive matter and if you guys want to get back there i guess you guys at the earliest you guys could get back there in two days okay you have at the mook but at the most these characters have nine days at the most they have nine days in order to

[Speaker 3]
recover that uh guy who died anyone need berries i swear to god bro i mean if you want to spend

[Speaker 2]
questions on it that's fine i didn't get touched yeah no you didn't get breathed on but i still have 208 hit points worth so i can show meryl looks to have beyond like half hp by the way

[Speaker 1]
how much xp from this game i saw your question okay how many players did we have tonight

[Speaker 6]
seven i think three four five one person left so yep

[Speaker 2]
k-dog wasn't isn't playing right where am i stupid hey james howdy did you change your uh

[Speaker 3]
philosophy on how much xp the party earns because it's been a while uh because it's been like a hot minute since i've seen like a big xp dump usually it's maybe 400 to 1000 it's usually is that true if you go into the session reports uh maybe i was just a part of like smaller sized ones

[Speaker 1]
if you're thinking of i think the last time because when did we last play together i think we were on a i think we were on a dungeon expedition yeah i understand the 400 xp each

[Speaker 3]
there because i mean didn't really do much you guys played horrifically you killed like two guys uh but yeah like if i scroll up it's like 1k 1k

[Speaker 1]
no so the 1k thing is what i give people for writing a session report yeah i'm looking at the um like that was 1400 see here go further it was 1000 xp for again we've been running a lot of newbie sessions and they haven't been getting a lot done but you scroll up to like experience inspires rana's cleanup crew uh the loot was 750 electrum 500 gold pieces 200 platinum pieces wand of magic missile flame-toned scimitar mr cherry's vase that's tommy lee cherry's vase which is uh which was left behind and it was 8600 xp per person that's a lot more xp than uh then the little isle session before that was a 4800 xp yeah i'm going back to the memories of

[Speaker 3]
like hollow of the elf cane 22 000 xp to each play you guys killed like a cr 25 guardian

[Speaker 1]
and that was after mowing down what was it some hellhounds uh some boggarts i think there was one other thing that you fought i can't remember

[Speaker 3]
lime creature is what i call it but six players right not seven

[Speaker 2]
nice

[Speaker 1]
it was a question if i'm counting incredible if you're in that rez ryan fallen and bar one two three four five six yes so divided by six you guys will have a flat 5000 xp to split up between your various characters um remember that your

[Speaker 3]
companions here all right let's give rock some xp then let me see

[Speaker 2]
hey i only need 8 000 more xp for a level up um but which one which character uh diana

[Speaker 1]
oh nice how are you splitting up for uh for your guys

[Speaker 2]
i mean no i mean uh fallen yeah i'm going to fall into uh tiana

[Speaker 1]
i need to get that next level so is it 5 000 xp per character 5 000 xp per person to get split up between characters however you like all right and then those of you with companions a lot of reminder note for special reports

[Speaker 6]
just to ask for the touching a campaign how much xp did you tell me i cannot it was thousand or something for my other character are you talking about um the top session when my other character died you tell me i cannot thousand and something xp

[Speaker 1]
i said you can add a thousand xp to this character for okay session report did you not do that

[Speaker 3]
uh i did not add it i'm gonna have to know okay it's weird whenever i level rock up he's not

[Speaker 1]
getting more hit points that is crazy i'll send you a document the updated document for higher links i can't promise it this month it's probably gonna be after i move uh explains it but basically rock rock isn't gonna have to deal with like hit points or anything like that he'll just like have a flat amount of stamina and as long as he has stamina he could add damage to your attacks and if he doesn't if he takes damage that takes that stamina out then he can't participate until the

[Speaker 3]
until the uh next combat or until he's all right well rock is level four now he's he's getting

[Speaker 5]
somewhere awesome on mute nice past 10 minutes oh shit oh shoot welcome back i was over here like hey how is everybody oh thank goodness the dragons are down is everyone okay i was like healing we're ignoring you sorry or like i healed merrill for nine hp this has been a very fun i'm really surprised that this character's versatility i look forward to playing with

[Speaker 3]
y'all again hell yeah yeah i'll have to create more characters because jesus i did not

[Speaker 1]
is this whatever happened to your dwarf guy he still exists right he he still exists

[Speaker 5]
yes you still want to oh you don't like him yeah you know i i think i think i want to tell the group here that while the red dragon was um still up i had cast hypnotic pattern on it and for the briefest of of a second i i saw what could only be described as a smooth mask like smooth uh smooth nose smooth lips smooth ears but with antlers coming out of the isolates and after that had fallen um my character hasn't really doesn't really know anything about it is that something any of y'all would know about maybe i don't interesting

[Speaker 6]
it's you're not a conspiracy board maybe it's connected to something there

[Speaker 1]
also something you could do for your downtime action is research uh technically you'll be traveling back but regardless of where you're traveling back you could just ask around to receive details not just from the i guess technically from the other party members and stuff that they might not be thinking of right now i could like add those details in if you did a research downtime action interesting um then what happens is i just feed you information i make a role for you on the back end i just feed you information

[Speaker 5]
my character has a fey in ancestry the the the horns make me think it might be fey related is that is that something my character might know about being a fey roll a uh roll two things roll

[Speaker 1]
an arcana check and roll a religion check gotcha the whole reason i was actually stopped here was to visit a shrine and i guess now you could now the combat's over you could just go look at it it is a shrine with that symbol or uh it's a shrine of a creature standing um with that again just a mask over the face or mask composing the face smoothed over with the exception of the eyes

[Speaker 5]
out of which yet the horn oof intelligence is not my best score it's a shrine it's a shrine you are on land breathing air so james uh the you said something about being able to get hides

[Speaker 3]
from the dragon or is that only for those two people no no the one anybody who's like working on this can get uh links of dragon hide okay uh and how would i roll for that all right i think

[Speaker 5]
i'm gonna dip out here it's been a pleasure and i look forward to playing well with y'all some more with this character he's pretty fun thanks for the games everybody that's fine good night absolutely

[Speaker 3]
see you later all right so how would we roll for dragon hide would that be survival i just rolled

[Speaker 1]
the uh i just rolled the thing there you got people who are you have no particular time pressures here so okay a two dragon hide i'm assuming two links of dragon hide as uh about 10 by 10 each

[Speaker 2]
all right and there's like a in the yeah there's special armor for that right

[Speaker 1]
in the masterwork speaking of special items uh i was unawares that that item gave you lycanthropy um that's that's not going to be active uh can't ruby yeah i hate that i hate to take that away from you if you want to switch it to a different item you can but i can switch it okay okay oh no uh lycanthropy no the vampire

[Speaker 2]
character has had their day absolutely ruined no this is not the wizard is not does not drink dragon blood okay wizard is just normal are there any other magic items to keep uh

[Speaker 3]
let's give like resistances and stuff james you're gonna have a hell of a time when this character reaches like 15th level oh yeah because i plan on getting uh one more level and like fighter for extra attack but i plan on dipping all my levels into rogue

[Speaker 2]
we love ranged sneak attack we do hell yeah do you run with the draconic boons from fistfuls

[Speaker 1]
by the way the character gains the lycanthrope speed in non-human form damage immunities traits and actions that don't involve equipment so the way that i read that is that in your non-humanoid form you receive those benefits

[Speaker 2]
it wait let me go into like let me go into like can't be rules again uh like can like control the character gains the lycanthrope speeds in a non-humanoid form damage immunities traits and actions that that don't involve equipment uh yes um by

[Speaker 6]
by the way can i ask actually is anybody on the boat alive on the boats sorry can you ask that

[Speaker 1]
again uh is any npc alive that's on the boats okay so i didn't hear you the first time and saying it at the same volume and and cadence is not going to help me i'm about half deaf are there any npcs alive on the boat yeah yeah only so cory died and the what is it the knight is taking a nap over by the

[Speaker 6]
so can i can i ask some of them about rumors about some undead things rumors about undead

[Speaker 1]
things sure you could because you have uh zane there who's in that session so he'll be happy to tell you oh yeah you're so-and-so's uh brother well you don't look like his brother but he died

[Speaker 3]
he's dead while i'm here uh i'm assuming the the merchants they might be a little shook but i'm sure they're still on the boat right okay i have some gems from previous sessions that i have yet to sell okay yeah uh some of these go back a while so a silver necklace with a gemstone pendant this is worth every single me dumping off the treasury mic so this is all that yeah all right um in total it's 370 gold pieces worth of jewelry oh 370 yeah you could you could

[Speaker 2]
we cut that off that'd be fine could we camp or could i camp out here recently like if there's a dragon nearby could perhaps search for a horde or something like set up camp here and stuff i don't know where we are on the map exactly you guys are at i'm gonna put it over here

[Speaker 3]
i found those are the first jewels i've sold this whole time there you go it's on the

[Speaker 1]
uh i'm gonna still be around for a little while here but i run with fizz bands draconic gifts and boons you could everything that's um and then i need to know either here well i you can also tell me here but i need you to i need to know in downtime which of you are going back for the tomb and when because i'm sensitive uh yeah as soon as possible my character let's say i know what happened by speaking to the other person you guys have let's see here eight days from today in real life to get it done and these characters that's max uh and these characters have max what is it two three four five days to get it done uh for the in-game calendar it'll be ending the session on you guys started on the first of this month and you'll be ending on the fourth so and still the sill will be turned into a nasferatu by the ninth so if you want that okay

[Speaker 3]
uh forgive me for sound really fucking stupid here what exactly is a nosferatu that's a vampire right super vampire like that's like some dracula stuff yeah these links aren't working

[Speaker 2]
yeah there we go i mean even if i turn yeah even if he turns we can uh revert his alignment and then i need the intelligence thing not to be yeah and then he doesn't yeah and then he doesn't

[Speaker 8]
go into crippling that because otherwise we would need race that i assume if he turns into a nosferatu that would be bad i mean not necessarily like what do they still like retain intelligence

[Speaker 2]
they're stupid yeah that's what we're trying to remedy but his alignment would change but there's this neat little spell called ceremony where i can touch a creature whose alignment has changed and make a dc20 insight check and if i succeed and there's no limit on how many times you can try this by the way uh their alignment reverts then there's no time limit on that

[Speaker 8]
which is very stupid and then i would need to hit a point of intelligence yeah so it's kind of up to you if the dragon was gory

[Speaker 2]
sorry jim i you see i only heard you name fizzpans i didn't hear what you said about fizzpans

[Speaker 1]
yeah so like if you're if you're looking for something specific from fizzpans i don't know

[Speaker 2]
what you're no there are like draconic gifts and stuff for like uh killing a dragon it says it erupts and like there's a list of like uh what happens when the dragon dies and like stuff like you i mean i linked it it's like draconic familiar draconic rebirth

[Speaker 1]
please don't uh draconic senses yeah so i haven't done anything with that in this campaign in particular open to using it uh would not apply in the specific circumstance reasons that may or may not get discovered that's up to you guys oh but um but the dragon just seemed to swoop in right there's no reason to believe there's a horde nearby or something how on again how i don't like let me wait wait let me make this even more explicit when you ask me questions like this it makes me not want to play with you because i feel like you're just saying um xyz right and then i have to commit to the thing or give a really long explanation for why which is not a position that you're you're not you don't have any reason to put me in that position you guys have downtime no you have ways of searching around for it you know that the dragon swooped down and tried to get somebody yeah i was wondering if i could roll where what direction it came from i mean what para did was that'd be something that you asked me in downtime and said

[Speaker 2]
is the downtime oh that's it oh it's a downtime action even if it just happened okay even if what just happened even like even if it just happened because where it came from that like what you're trying to find its horde i'm trying to find where it came from you're trying

[Speaker 1]
find its horde that's the thing you just asked me about right uh yes or uh where it came from but

[Speaker 8]
yes so okay well you let me know in the downtime thread so that's research like but then i have to stay here correct what does what does research say i mean i assume you have to what's your math

[Speaker 2]
second second second very background noise second

[Speaker 8]
by the way james yes well my my method yeah check the drop box i just want to ask why did you tell

[Speaker 6]
us you want us to message about our characters going for the vampire session in downtime or in

[Speaker 8]
some other chat uh in either either place

[Speaker 1]
okay if you want to do something during downtime because um you guys could do so there's certain stuff you could do while you're going on the way back i could be anti-social

[Speaker 3]
you can be anti-social on the way back yeah yo i can go fucking thieve around i might die for it

[Speaker 1]
but hey that's the whole point is like listen you should be able to to go and thieve around if you want to be able to like hey grab it a little bit of extra gold that should be open to people the problem is when it comes up in session is that it messes with with a bunch of people but if you know if you have one guy i think i said this on i was reading an article about some

[Speaker 8]
deranged asshole who's really mad about a video i put out about a year ago

[Speaker 1]
uh went over his stuff and one of the things he mentioned was people who didn't have as much time to play being screwed over and i said like hey if you give the thief two weeks of downtime guaranteed that's two weeks he gets to spend away from the paladin it's normally watching over no looking over his shoulder constantly i think i saw that video today

[Speaker 3]
oh yeah reminds me of the um about one person i told you about the anti-socialism is normal

[Speaker 1]
well i think i think we talked about that earlier yeah i have no idea if they were talking about politically or whatever and don't care not intended to discuss it but um because i don't know the context of that situation but it definitely sounded like

[Speaker 3]
they were being weird you know it was more of them just uh getting really mad at me and it was like a ha gotcha moment it's like when someone um they don't know what they're talking

[Speaker 8]
about but they like they i just put all my stuff over it's like i'm back

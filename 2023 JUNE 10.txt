[Speaker 5]
Hey James.

[Speaker 1]
Howdy! Oh god, you do sound sick.

[Speaker 8]
I was going to say the same thing.

[Speaker 1]
Buddy, what's going on?

[Speaker 5]
Um, I got the flu and then that has just become very nasally. And I feel a lot better today so... Ah, I forgot to take my antibiotics, hang on, I'll be back in a second.

[Speaker 1]
Go do that, I'm gonna go use the restroom.

[Speaker 4]
Hello. I had to frantically unmake and remake my bed after discovering one of the cats peed on it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Dex, why are you trying to eat my avocado? What is it with you guys?

It's avocado.

[Speaker 6]
My cat accidentally peed on my couch a while ago.

[Speaker 3]
All right, well, turns out cats do in fact actually like avocado. I looked it up because I was like, why are they like trying to get at it so hard? It's because it is a fatty fruit and they love it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh yeah, the fat. My dad's cat loves peanut butter.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I would be worried if a cat tried to eat the avocado pit. I don't think a cat could eat the avocado pit. One of the things is what happens if the cat eats the avocado pit and it says it's a choking hazard, but how?

[Speaker 4]
Well, aren't they like two inches across?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Unless it's a small pit, which I have seen, it's gonna like...

[Speaker 3]
Can they even open their mouth that big? I know when they yawn. Okay.

They can have tiny amounts. Would you like a tiny amount of avocado so that you leave me alone on it? He's...

[Speaker 6]
I don't feel like he's gonna leave you alone. Okay, he just wanted to sniff it. He didn't even want to eat it.

Okay.

[Speaker 3]
That's fine, more avocado for me. Hey, I forgot my peanut sauce. Did they give it to me?

No.

[Speaker 5]
I have returned and I'm fully medicated.

[Speaker 8]
That's good.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not sure if you saw, but people want all of the unicorn horns back and I kind of just wanted to get rid of them. So we're getting an adult dragon in exchange. So I guess- I did see that.

I guess... I guess Para... Maya, Morgan, and Theoneral have joined custody of the dragon and reconcile with you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's fine. I have Bluey, so... I can't do it.

You'll have to.

[Speaker 6]
Doesn't belong in this universe. She's too small and young.

[Speaker 3]
Depending on what kind of dragon it is, we should name it Chili.

[Speaker 5]
James has not told me yet. I need to remind him probably. Hello, probably.

I was just talking to Otto about how they offered to catch a dragon for the returnal of their unicorn horns.

[Speaker 1]
All right.

[Speaker 7]
Close this down.

[Speaker 3]
That avocado is so good. I love just spooning it out of the skin.

[Speaker 1]
It's a lot of fun. I don't need the calories from the toast. I only need the calories from the avocado.

[Speaker 3]
One day I will make avocado ice cream.

[Speaker 1]
I have no idea how that tastes.

[Speaker 3]
Probably like avocado, but sweet.

[Speaker 2]
And cold.

[Speaker 3]
I've had an avocado smoothie with chocolate before and it was pretty good.

[Speaker 1]
That's not so bad. That makes me... I just keep imagining like mint chocolate, but with like avocado instead of the mint.

But I can't like separate the two. So I just keep like assuming like a... I keep imagining a mint taste with the avocado.

I'd like to cross the wire.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, you should probably put mint in it. I don't think it would be like that bad. The avocado is really just a replacement for the cream and the fat.

So you could make your avocado ice cream taste like anything. The avocado is pretty easily overpowered too, so. Every time I see that kobold dragon, it's like, wow, he's so beefy.

[Speaker 5]
It's all in the front. You can't see the back part, but he only does front legs.

[Speaker 8]
Hip, back, leg day. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Like his neck swallows hell. His tail, not.

[Speaker 3]
I think I drew something like that once. Hang on. Do I have it?

Can I find that super quick? I did. God, which folder would that be in?

It's nonsense, but would it be in my nonsense folder or is it somewhere weird? Because I forgot to change out of my nonsense folders. I know it's an older one.

Super beefy guy, tiny skinny legs. I can picture it vividly in my mind.

[Speaker 6]
Like a true Dorito.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, you know, like Handsome Jack. Man has no fricking leg day whatsoever. His legs are so skinny, but his top half is just straight up Dorito.

[Speaker 1]
Let me look at this. Oh, he's just like me. Excellent.

I too have no leg strength. Okay, so are you folks ready to get sorted here?

[Speaker 5]
I am. Oh, ready. I was just wondering, so this is the Eldersworth of Banyan-Tan, is that correct?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
I was just confused on how we would be able to join them, is all.

[Speaker 1]
That'll be pretty simple.

[Speaker 3]
After the- I mean, Parra could always send out a sending and be like, hey, so this happened. Help?

[Speaker 1]
The Banyan-Tan is pretty likely to actually contact you after they were more or less like brought into custody. Be like, hey, is this your kobold? And basically sending you an invitation after that interaction.

Good.

[Speaker 5]
Who will I send? He's closer to level 12 than Sierra is. Am I able to send Maya for this?

Sure.

[Speaker 1]
All righty. So let's see here. You said Maya is coming up?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, Maya will go this one.

[Speaker 1]
All right, perfect, perfect. Okay. So Maya will attend as a representative.

She'll arrive at the Banyan Cairn. This particular, some of you have been in Elven Cairns before. I think I've described some of them to you.

These are Elven cities or towns that are hidden in the in-between spaces. They lie in a spot between the world and the prime material. It's their way of keeping themselves nice and hidden away while still able to interact with the outside world.

This particular Cairn isn't very large. It's rather, it's significantly smaller, in fact, than the White Orchid Cairn, which was like a real improper city. This is probably about more the size of Bronloch, if a little smaller.

It's also the first time you've seen a Cairn without a obvious majority population. It looks to be split about evenly, or wait, no, I misread that note. That wasn't like nearly all Elves.

There looks to be about a quarter of the residents here appear to be Halflings. It's the first Halfling settlement most of you folks would have seen in the Valley.

[Speaker 4]
Why?

[Speaker 1]
No particular reason. It's just they don't, not a lot of them live up here.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, let's see here. You folks would have gotten into contact with, let's see here. Maya would have been greeted by, oh, I'm so pleased that didn't save.

God, that's so annoying. Go ahead. I just typed this out.

Okay, so you would have been greeted by Devrim Rosalo. She is the Captain of the Guard here and Chief of Security. She offers to escort you to your party, to your allies, associates.

[Speaker 5]
Maya will accept this.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, yes, lovely. I'm glad everybody will have an opportunity to cooperate. Now, I have to admit, I find myself worried with all these adventurers poking around near our care, and I know that you folks are great friends of the King of the North.

Is this accurate, what my spies have told me?

[Speaker 5]
Um, sorry, out of character. The King of the North is a frosty man, isn't he? We are no friends of his.

We are actively going against his plans for the valley.

[Speaker 1]
I see. See, this poses something of an issue. As far as I'm concerned, The King, King Singvir, long be his reign.

They trust you so far, but I, for one, don't really like as many folks poking around increasing the risk that the Witch King will look downwards and perhaps attack our small village again.

[Speaker 5]
When was the last time your village was attacked? Oh, about three days...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, no, sorry, that's inaccurate. Last session was about one time, about ten days ago. There's a small raiding party that's traveling through the woad.

[Speaker 5]
That didn't happen because of us, did it?

[Speaker 1]
Well, no, but just, you know, all the elven cairns have been attacked. But we don't want to be attacked again, is all I'm saying. At this point, you folks would have reached the, what is it, Devrim, looking almost confused by your question, almost perplexed, informs you that you've arrived at the guardhouse where your associates are being kept.

They haven't been jailed, they just haven't really been allowed to leave. They've been more or less on house arrest in this location.

[Speaker 5]
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your escort.

[Speaker 1]
Right this way.

[Speaker 5]
Does Maia get to see everyone else shackled up full on?

[Speaker 1]
No, like I said, they've just been on house arrest, pretty much.

[Speaker 5]
So, this is a predicament, it seems.

[Speaker 2]
One time, I've seen. I don't know if this was about us to say something.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I was about to say, I thought somebody said something, but I couldn't tell if it was so garbled up, I couldn't tell if that was like static. That wasn't.

[Speaker 2]
It might have been me trying to say something, but it must not have come from me, I suppose. Well, never mind.

[Speaker 1]
Devrim says, well, I have been ordered your release from the guardhouse here, but I have not been ordered to release you from the city bounds. You are still restricted to the city limits here.

[Speaker 5]
Very well. How are we able to finalize this so we can get on with our lives?

[Speaker 1]
Well, the king did insist that he speak with you folks.

[Speaker 2]
I suppose. Now's a good time, isn't he?

[Speaker 1]
Now's a good time, isn't he? Just looking increasingly annoyed that you guys get to actually leave this place. There's like a constant look of consternation on her face.

Like a female Tucker Carlson. Low brow. Never does anything with the eyebrows.

[Speaker 4]
Hirona is leaving a little hidden all tops are bastards somewhere in the house where they live.

[Speaker 7]
Jeez. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
So you folks are escorted to the palatial estate. It's quite modest, given how many palatial estates you folks have been to in recent months. It's probably quite modest compared to most of them.

As opposed to a tower that goes up, you folks are introduced to a proper cairn of like actual rocks going up as if a building is buried beneath. Once you folks reach the top of it you are introduced to a tower that stretches downwards.

[Speaker 2]
It has...

[Speaker 1]
It is a like I said the tower stretches downwards. There are gaps in the structure where you can see that there is another set of ground, another ground level at the very bottom of this particular tower where something that looks like sunlight is filtering in. There's deer and rabbits frolicking about.

It's like an enclosed space in another enclosed space. Well, when you work in a place like this I don't know. It affords us...

I don't know. Why are you questioning our art? Why are you doing this?

[Speaker 4]
We're not questioning. We're appreciating.

[Speaker 1]
Fine, fine. Just hurry along. Hurry along.

You folks will reach the very bottom of the tower where the throne room is held. There are a bunch of elven warriors wearing stuff that's kind of like togas except they're composed of they have a lot of sunflower motifs on them. They're all wielding spears and have shields strapped to their backs.

There's a second row of archers that guard various doorways and openings to the field outside. King Singvir rises from his seat. He has what looks like a crown that is arrayed to look like a halo.

The top half of his face is burned and scarred. If his eyes are capable of opening you don't currently see them. But otherwise looks like a fairly normal wood elf.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, totally normal for somebody to have their face burned off like that.

[Speaker 2]
Well, other than that...

[Speaker 4]
Good luck, boys.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Bala doesn't do much.

[Speaker 5]
Bala would bow as well.

[Speaker 1]
Welcome! Fair adventurous?

[Speaker 4]
Tyrona just barely pulls off a curtsy. She does never... Look, her favorite royal runs around in the wood.

[Speaker 1]
The bow is making fun of your curtsy as you uh, as you attempted, which is impeding your progress. It's well adventurous. I suppose you're wondering why I brought you here today.

And it's because my chief of security would like to turn you over to the Witch King in hopes that it will secure peace between our royal houses.

[Speaker 2]
That's optimistic.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. Well, I told her as much, one, in the difficulty of actually capturing you, and two, in the... After all, you have been quite polite houseguests, but I don't think that proper capture would have produced anything of merit.

Perhaps more... I suspect it would have gone very bad for you. I have my doubts, as to either outcome, frankly.

But second, you are not the only troublemaker Sofine has had to deal with in the last few months.

[Speaker 2]
Such as?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, ill tidings for some of the Drow houses. Some of the Winterfey are speaking of rebellion. Some of the Summerfey, I hear, have actually returned, stopped fleeing, and gone back to their rightful place in this valley.

As far as I'm concerned, it looks as if those in opposition to Sofine are well-suited to attack him. But I am worried that Sofine remains well-suited to attack us in the meantime.

[Speaker 2]
Out of character, remind me again who Sofine is, if the name's come up before?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. He's the Witch King.

[Speaker 1]
He's the Witch King at the very top of the... He's the one who's spreading the frost down from the top of the map.

[Speaker 8]
Right, okay.

[Speaker 1]
But I hoped if I brought you here, we could discuss some sort of aid or assistance in securing an alliance.

[Speaker 5]
I suppose that makes sense.

[Speaker 2]
We shall come an enemy after all. Indeed.

[Speaker 1]
One of the most common ways in which we would secure an alliance with someone like Sofine, as I'm sure the White Orca Cairn would have told you, is by marrying someone off. Unfortunately, I have no heir. And Sofine has already turned down marriage proposals from my royal house, so that leaves me, if I wish to secure an alliance with another noble house, I am restricted to offering my hand in marriage to them.

But we are not prosperous, Cairn. We are sleepy. We enjoy our abundance in peace and quiet.

This is fair. There's no great industry here. Our warriors prioritize beauty over prowess in battle.

[Speaker 4]
Can I poke the wreath and see if it knows why he has no heir? Is it just that he's never been married or that something happened to his heir?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, his wife and daughter were killed while they were en route to a treat with the White Feather Court. It's another winter-aligned court that is known for training mounts and riding dragons and all sorts of other fun giant beasts and really living it up in the air. They're quite a martial folk.

As far as I know, the envoy never made it there and they were discovered dead sometime later.

[Speaker 4]
That sounds extremely suspicious.

[Speaker 2]
Indeed. It's a good way to firmate the trust between the two sides if you're a third party wanting to keep them at each other's throats.

[Speaker 1]
Now, as to specifics, we have a few tasks for you folks that could lead us to have, I don't know, something of a better relationship both internally and externally. I just want to make sure that my people will be kept safe.

[Speaker 4]
Surely the highest duty of any warlord.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent. All right, I'm going to take a 10-15 minute break. I have to go take care of something before I can return, so it's not distracting me from what we're trying to do here.

So I'm going to go take care of that real quick and then we're going to jump into it.

[Speaker 2]
Is your captain here? Is your captain here or has your captain not been introduced as of yet? What's going on here?

[Speaker 4]
Are you saying captor or captain? Or character, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Character, sorry. Is one of your captors here yet or is it yet to be introduced? Are you waiting for that?

[Speaker 6]
I'm waiting to be introduced. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's fair enough.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know where I am. What's going on?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, fair enough. I was kind of thrown in the deep end as well.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, it's all good. Fine, because it lets me get the kids settled.

[Speaker 2]
All right, I'm going to get myself some more water.

[Speaker 5]
I love how smug Jesse's token is. I love Inigo Montoya.

[Speaker 6]
I did appreciate that token.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. He's been on merchant duty for like the last three months or so at this point. His token's just always near my keep.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, now that he's done with the unicorn horns is he going to come do things or is he just kind of there now forever?

[Speaker 5]
Well, both Maya and Sierra are like three levels ahead of him. I was like, do I really want to play a level 8 character again? Well, actually I like Jesse as a healer and we don't ever need a healer when para's about.

He's my backup healer essentially. Then again, he has gum. Maybe I just stick him on the Pegasus and put him 60 feet in the air and just get him to shoot at stuff.

I'm sure that won't infuriate James at all.

[Speaker 4]
Wow, suddenly all of our enemies have wings! How did that happen?

[Speaker 5]
I just get struck by lightning and all damage kills me. New character sign.

[Speaker 2]
Although, how many things have muskets in this game I don't think that's terribly advisable.

[Speaker 5]
Too many of them damn have muskets. Actually, you're right.

[Speaker 7]
Whoa, stop.

[Speaker 5]
How did you get arrested, actually? I forgot to ask.

[Speaker 3]
We activated a sun shrine and then they just kind of showed up and were like, so we kind of have to take you into custody and we're like, okay.

[Speaker 4]
We really didn't fight it at all. I think Kyrona did put up a token of what did we do wrong but yeah, they were being nice and didn't feel like fighting them.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It's kind of more like, we've got a suspicious report about X and X happening and you've come in for questioning.

[Speaker 5]
Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
I was also so confused when the king was talking because I was like, are you asking one of us to marry you? I know, that was my thought! I was like, is that the quest we're being given?

[Speaker 4]
I'll do a lot of things for my I'll do a lot of things for my country but not that.

[Speaker 7]
Hello.

[Speaker 5]
We're just taking a quick break from a session. Yeah, James just had to do something.

[Speaker 7]
Ah, cool.

[Speaker 4]
The music has kicked in.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, Winnie the Pooh's playing in the background so it got real creepy. Like, Winnie the Pooh is not this creepy what has happened?

[Speaker 4]
This is the part after Christopher Robin learns what bears really like to eat and has the nightmare where Winnie chases him through the thousand acre woods, roaring.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no.

[Speaker 4]
You don't remember that?

[Speaker 1]
No. Like, absolutely not, actually. It was moved and the system was very unhappy about it.

[Speaker 4]
Something just clicked. Did the bow tell me that the bodies were never of the king and king's wife and daughter were never recovered?

[Speaker 1]
No, so the envoy never arrived. They did find the bodies, though.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. Would he be interested in marrying Valyria?

[Speaker 1]
Valyria would be... I don't think I could actually secure an alliance with her. It's an interesting thought.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was asking the bow more than I was asking the king.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Of course, the bow is probably going to give the same answer.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Why not? What does that mean exactly?

[Speaker 1]
Well... Here's the problem. He is an elf, or a fae, and while there's certainly no issue with...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, right. I forgot.

[Speaker 1]
Their respective societies work quite differently. I believe the primary issue you would have is not so much the presence of intermixing of courts or anything like that. That would probably be fine.

I would caution you...

[Speaker 4]
But she is naturally, like, 12 feet tall. It might be difficult to...

[Speaker 1]
I don't think he would have an issue with that. Listen, if I was in an elf body, I wouldn't have an issue with that either. In fact, I wouldn't even hesitate.

[Speaker 4]
That makes me wonder who you used to be, buddy.

[Speaker 1]
That was just me speaking. No. Oh, I thought it was you!

No, that was a lie. Well, it was half of a lie. Don't worry about it.

Okay. Jeez.

[Speaker 4]
Now that I said that, I am wondering if the wreath was, like, a person cursed by Oberon to become a bow. That would be cool. And that's why it doesn't want to see him again.

[Speaker 1]
It is certainly not out of the question. The Fey do love their curses. Now that we're back, the king informs you folks.

So, you've been reactivating sun shrines, and this is how we discovered you folks. Indeed. So it is you then.

Okay. This is actually quite good for us, because we have something that we're fairly confident virtually no other resource, no other faction in this land holds, which is we have incomplete sun shrines. You don't say.

[Speaker 4]
That is fascinating.

[Speaker 1]
Scattered apart that need to be charged into. So we suffer from the same curse that everyone else does in this valley, where we're unable to remember the name of the god who created these. But luckily we do still remember our store of these things.

We have no idea why we have them. But their recent reactivation caused I commanded my mages to go along and figure out a way of restoring them, and they believe that they have found such a way. Now if you folks were to be so gracious as to assist us in recharging some of these objects, it would be a fantastic boon.

[Speaker 2]
What does recharging the sun shrines entail?

[Speaker 1]
So specifically, we need them to be imbued with ley energy, reconnected to the land, so that when they're actually activated, they draw from the land's bounty. They draw from the blessing that was laid upon this land so that it's not weightless. It has to be rooted to a specific place.

The sun shrine that you reactivated will forever remain in that place.

[Speaker 4]
Can we place more sun shrines along the same ley line?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's not about placing them on the ley line itself. It's that they need to be charged with ley energy, for which we will be sending you to a once-active druid grove that has now sadly fallen into disrepair. But when we're reasonably confident, you will be able to recharge.

We do think it's dangerous, however, so we encourage you to... well, just be careful.

[Speaker 2]
We're no strangers of danger.

[Speaker 1]
This was once attacked by the drow. In fact, the only part of the druid grove that was left standing afterwards was, I hear, on account of adventurers like yourselves were cleared from this place, and the ley crystal that keeps everything working, keeps the ley lines nearby stable, was maintained. I have no idea whether we haven't been able to contact any of the druids who were even left standing afterwards, or left alive.

Though I fear that they too have perished at some point.

[Speaker 2]
How long ago was this since you last had contact with these druids?

[Speaker 1]
Last contact was... Goodness, it must have been at least six months ago. Oh.

[Speaker 2]
So to clarify, we need to investigate this grove, find any surviving druids possible, and reenergize the Sunshine location. Indeed.

[Speaker 4]
If you are... Does it sound like...

[Speaker 7]
Go ahead.

[Speaker 4]
Does it sound like the... the drow and the rescue by adventurers was something that happened with people affiliated with Sierra's Keep?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, absolutely. In fact, anybody who was there for that session, I don't know if anybody here was, but if anybody was there for that session, they will recognize it immediately.

[Speaker 4]
Would our characters know that it was...

[Speaker 1]
Uh... It seems... It seems unlikely.

Unless... Maia might recognize it.

[Speaker 5]
What was it?

[Speaker 1]
The place that you folks will be heading to. Ah. As well, one of my druids will happily escort you to the location if you're ready, but as I said, please be prepared.

[Speaker 2]
I'm always prepared.

[Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. I don't think there's any preparations I need to make.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, if such is the case, the druid leads you folks to a nearby tree sitting in the field, and says, well, best of luck to you. We'll be sending a cart in with all of the... with all of the shrine parts shortly thereafter.

Very well.

[Speaker 4]
How much is there?

[Speaker 1]
Well, we have six shrines, three of which we intend to cover the Cairn.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, just to also clarify out of character, is, uh, what we're doing all in the big ol' orange area, or... Is that where all this is happening, or...

[Speaker 1]
Wait, the big ol' what?

[Speaker 2]
Well, you know, where we went last time, basically, this big orange area. The Sunflower Forest. Sort of.

[Speaker 5]
Pretty much.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's where we went and activated the shrine, and I assume that his little, uh, kingdom is in this area, right?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, can you guys see the thing that's labeled Banyan Cairn right here?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, so that's where he is. Okay, that's where we're at the moment, I assume.

[Speaker 1]
It's not going to be where you guys are in a moment. Uh, you guys are getting teleported.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, obviously we get teleported somewhere, but I was just wondering if his goal was to set up shrines all throughout the Cairn here. Right. That's just what it sounded like he was saying, but that's not what he meant, so then...

Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
The important thing is you guys are getting, uh, you guys are getting teleported.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, good ol' tree stride. Wee! We'll teleportation via trees, one of those things.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that reminds me, um, are there any teleportation circles here?

[Speaker 1]
There is one. Uh, they have not shown you access to it, for obvious reasons, but...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because we're still trying to get his, uh, friendship.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay, I didn't think that through. I got over-excited.

[Speaker 7]
It's okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right, we're already in the thick of it. Are these drow or vampires? Oh, no.

[Speaker 1]
Drow vampires. All right, she is.

[Speaker 5]
They're underdressed. At least the gladiator-looking dudes aren't. They don't need to wear much when there's no sunlight.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's called modesty, but... But if they're still matriarchal as they usually are, then I can understand them for some of the other reasons for that. Okay, so the scene was meant to be night.

Indeed. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
In fact, that reminds me, was Landy or Para there for Outer Star? Were either of you there for a shrine that had... that you folks had to, like, clear out?

It was smothered in darkness, and when you guys reactivated the shrine...

[Speaker 5]
That was Para, Sierra, Core...

[Speaker 1]
There was a fellow named Arcan there. That was pretty...

[Speaker 5]
Yep, and that was the rogue that we had that left after the first session as well. Which session was that? I think that was your first session.

[Speaker 1]
It might have been your first session.

[Speaker 5]
I remember the rogue's sword got continually flamed. With the big...

[Speaker 4]
With the big hole?

[Speaker 5]
Yes. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I was like, get in the hole! I'm a control mage! And I was like, no, I'm not getting in the hole.

And he was not impressed, and then he did plant growth...

[Speaker 1]
He does plant growth. ...anyway. I think he did Entangle that time. No, I did Entangle, which fucked up his plan.

Because two of the druids came back.

[Speaker 5]
At what point was Nessie's character going to be joining us, James?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, as far as I'm concerned now, she's basically hopping in with the... I feel like an idiot. I never asked you to introduce your character.

[Speaker 2]
We're just gonna assume this is a joint operation.

[Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm. But if you'd like to introduce your character, like name and stuff like that, now would be a perfect time.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, I am. Well, from the distance, you hear very loud, I can't believe it! Is that my Pera?!

And Pera gets... She gets... glomped.

She gets sideswiped and picked up. And hugged and kissed. Whoa!

Consent, my dude!

[Speaker 8]
My little Pera, how are you?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I think Pera just shrieks and is like joyfully wagging her tail.

[Speaker 6]
But I have all my memos back! Hello, darling! And she's still hugging Pera, and she looks around and she goes, and who are all these wonderful people?

We're trouble. Oh, that's the best kind of company, as long as you take care of my darling little Pera, and she stares.

[Speaker 5]
She tends to take care of us more than we take care of her, Maya says.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. We love Pera, rest assured.

[Speaker 6]
Oh good, that sounds exactly like her. She'll set you down.

[Speaker 7]
So bring Hugo here!

[Speaker 2]
The king wanted us to do a job for him.

[Speaker 6]
We were mildly arrested. I mean, who hasn't been mildly arrested? You see a halfling that's a little bit taller than normal halflings and she's blonde and she's got like mom the equivalent of mom clothes and leather and a bag strapped across her chest, like a little bag of holdings.

I'm Mimosa.

[Speaker 2]
You're welcome. Maya. Tyrona.

[Speaker 4]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty, so you folks are going to go through the portal that's been constructed by the druid before you. You are launched into what is yet again a darkened space.

[Speaker 5]
Raise your hands if you can see.

[Speaker 3]
Pera, throw your hand up.

[Speaker 5]
I have 60 foot dark vision currently. James, does my devil side help me here?

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 5]
Am I allowed to set my vision to 120 then?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think devil side always gives you I think devil side works on...

[Speaker 5]
How do you do that? Oh, there we go. I see it.

[Speaker 4]
I would keep the lantern down for now.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I'm just saying that because some of us probably can't see.

[Speaker 1]
These guys have not noticed you yet. If you want to avoid getting noticed, I need a stealth roll from the party.

[Speaker 2]
I can help with that.

[Speaker 5]
I'm happy to sneak by. Actually, James, do we get XP for sneaking by or do we need to kill everything we see?

[Speaker 1]
I do get people XP for bypassing encounters.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 3]
I rolled about an average of what I do.

[Speaker 6]
I add in the plus 10, right? It didn't do it automatically.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. It asks for a situational bonus and that's where I put the 10.

[Speaker 7]
Let's see.

[Speaker 3]
I'll reroll ones, I bet. I was like, what the heck is that equation?

[Speaker 1]
What is that?

[Speaker 3]
I think it's the halfling reroll ones.

[Speaker 1]
That was my reaction.

[Speaker 3]
I don't know why it says 1 equals 1, but...

[Speaker 1]
Does anybody speak Elvish in the party?

[Speaker 7]
I do.

[Speaker 1]
I do. So they're speaking quite loudly. It's like, I don't know why we have to guard this rigid, useless place.

I thought this was just a demonstration of our power. It did nothing. It's like, hush, hush, hush.

Listen, you don't want any of the Matrons to hear you. Nor the Inquisitor. Please.

Warm your hands on the cat if you must. Did you hear DisplacerBeast hiss? At her own peril, I suppose.

But seriously, it's not necessary to be so upset with this assignment. It's fine. Soon enough, whoever the Lady of Light will just be satisfied with what we've offered her.

We can leave this place. We don't have to keep up a pretense of guarding it. I was here to make sure no Druid would show up.

Come on. Back out to patrol. Hopefully that will warm your frail bones.

These two start moving along. Soon after, these two start moving. All right, what would the party like to do?

[Speaker 7]
Skulk. Skulk away.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the Halfling can't see.

[Speaker 6]
You'd be correct.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I assumed we would kind of form a humanoid chain. Robin can see, right?

[Speaker 2]
I can see just fine. I can help her by lifting her up and putting her on the back of my wolf that can see.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's smart. I thought we'd put Robin in the front and Karuna in the back.

[Speaker 2]
Stick with my wolf while we're skulking around. I'm just wondering if you can cast darkvision or something.

[Speaker 5]
I can cast darkvision. I'm going to spend two ki to cast darkvision.

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you for reminding me. That's just memoir so they can't see.

[Speaker 4]
Does Para have cursed darkvision? What? Cursed darkvision?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, from her object. Yeah, when you see something you don't want to see in the dark. Para also has normal darkvision.

[Speaker 1]
Para has a cursed item on her right now, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, but that's not where the darkvision's from. The cloak is what gives me the ability to see through magical darkness. The cursed item means I can't fire.

[Speaker 2]
A bow or like a firebolt?

[Speaker 3]
Like any fire spell.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see.

[Speaker 5]
Which means no torches. Maya gives Mimosa a tap on the shoulder and just see in the dark. Probably unsettling for a little bit.

Oh, that's alright.

[Speaker 6]
As long as someone helps me through it. Sure, hang on to Para.

[Speaker 5]
If you move Robin first then we can make sure we move in within 30 feet of you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm doing that.

[Speaker 5]
I can't move the bubble, it just doesn't move with you or anything. That's fine, we can measure from you. If you move first you end up moving further than that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think we should probably head south first and hug the treeline. Try to head north somewhere. I'm fine for everyone else though.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no.

[Speaker 7]
Which direction are people going?

[Speaker 6]
That's where I'm going. I can't see anything. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 5]
If you right click your token and then go to the cog you'll have the vision tab in the box that pops up. You can give yourself 60 for dark vision with the spell I've cast on you. You change your vision range to 60 and then the vision mode dark vision.

[Speaker 6]
I forgot that it does that. You make everything so automated.

[Speaker 1]
Is it working for you?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I got worried because I clicked on your token and I can't see anything with it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. It's black and white. It's grey.

[Speaker 2]
What are these? Hills?

[Speaker 1]
It's just more flowers and stuff like that. There's like a path or a few paths of little sunflowers running around.

[Speaker 4]
Are we here at night?

[Speaker 1]
You are.

[Speaker 4]
That would be stupid if we knew Drow were here.

[Speaker 1]
And you also can't see the stars.

[Speaker 5]
That's not normal. James, which way are these two walking?

[Speaker 1]
Right now, they're just hanging out here.

[Speaker 2]
Hopefully, they're looking the other way and once they do, I'm going to start sneaking by. Hopefully, there are people following me.

[Speaker 1]
The Inquisitor just has her back up against the wall. Are you guys walking in front of her?

[Speaker 2]
I'm trying not to.

[Speaker 5]
It's kind of the wall.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, you guys are walking right in front of her. Do you have anything for catching her attention? Or drawing it elsewhere?

Like, what are you...

[Speaker 2]
If they have invisible fairies, I can go, hey, listen.

[Speaker 4]
You could throw a pebble at her. I'm going to have my sprite go... I think over here where that patrol was.

Just because it's the opposite direction from us. Invisible. And just give out as big a blood-curdling scream as she can.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So the Drow Inquisitor is immediately going to look over, run over. These two guys are going to hug the wall.

Shit, it's the ghost! It's back! The Displacer Beast runs back and hides behind these two.

And you folks hear a rumbling. Where's my purple worm? Here it is.

It's good. You folks see a... Those of you who can see that far see a mage riding a purple worm.

It's kind of like up the side here.

[Speaker 2]
Master, what are you doing over there? Doing something. Is that a worm?

Not sure.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like the people over there hear a tiny little oh shit, oh fuck, as my familiar flies away as fast as you can.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the mage is just like, oh, you look startled to see me. What's going on? Anything to report?

It's like, well, we just heard a scream from this exact position not a few moments ago. We don't know what to... Like, ah, yes.

Uh, hmm. I can't see anything nearby so I would imagine you're fine. And they're just kind of like chatting.

Making a small talk back and forth.

[Speaker 5]
Are we going to be able to sneak around this wall, James? Are these guys going to spot us?

[Speaker 1]
If you guys are going within ten feet of people who have darkvision, like the... I don't care what stealth you have. Uh.

You guys got to try to take them out, distract them, or a mix of both.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, what people? Oh, there's somebody up there.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's dudes up there, dudes down there. So I think it's safest for us to go past these guys.

[Speaker 4]
Give me a second. Let me look through my familiar's eyes and see what's going on. Okay.

Um. I think I'm going to have her do the scream again. Like, up over here.

Um, over to the northwest again. But on the other side of the rock bridge. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, so that will, in a sense... This guy to look over.

[Speaker 4]
What are those things? Do I recognize them?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, which things?

[Speaker 4]
The things on the other side of this wall or hill.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they're just drow.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it looked like they were like, um...

[Speaker 1]
They look like from the dark crystal. They don't really look like drow, but um... I assume that was just the token art.

Uh, you hear this mage shout out, maintain your posts! Just searching around.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I'm going to have the familiar... No, no. I'm going to have the familiar scream in Elvish.

Like, Oh, Matron! Oh, help me! Ah!

[Speaker 1]
What's your familiar's AC?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, 16 now. Nope, 15. Sorry.

Ow.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, you get swallowed.

[Speaker 4]
Um, that should... Hang on. That should be a disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
You're right! That should be a disadvantage. Damn.

Does 26 hit?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Okay. It was great while it worked.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know how someone's going to act.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the mage turns around and says, someone's here! He says, regroup at the tree and fan out from there. Uh, and you see him, and you start seeing folks filter from this area.

They're starting to move down that way.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, let's see here. Eh, I'm supposed to stay safe.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this guy's rounding the corner.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Double back. Oh boy.

[Speaker 5]
Go ahead. Alright. Nevermind.

[Speaker 1]
You guys have a moment to, like, do something, but you've got to figure it out.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I was going to dart down over here if I could. I don't think you...

[Speaker 1]
No, you wouldn't have time for that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't think I would. So... I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Let's see. Hang on, let me look at something.

How far can I put this? Uh, 60 feet, and then it's 30 foot radius. So...

Like that? And I... Yeah, okay.

Okay. Uh, I'm... going to cast off.

[Speaker 7]
Okay!

[Speaker 2]
Hell yeah. I love to try to get this guy out as well.

[Speaker 4]
If you cast it a little bit closer to that rock wall, is it possible you'll get the purple worm as well? Or are we hoping it'll come into it?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, you mean like...

[Speaker 6]
Like... That?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think Zach gets picked up by the mic pretty easily.

[Speaker 6]
Uh, Zach's not out here. I don't know which town you're in. Rosemary is watching us.

Yes.

[Speaker 3]
The mic likes her.

[Speaker 1]
Don't worry.

[Speaker 3]
I'm just warning you.

[Speaker 1]
It's okay, I've been worried about... My cat has been going off every two seconds.

[Speaker 6]
My oldest child is also running around saying something. Oh no. Chris would like to pick them up.

[Speaker 1]
No, you're not skipping yet! Nope!

[Speaker 6]
Come here. Nope.

[Speaker 1]
Nope. You can sit right here.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 3]
I just don't know how that works.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's pretty real. Okay, so let's see here. These two Drow are going to be dead.

And that's going to be initiative. Uh, just give me a second. I'm going to do in combat.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think the giant skylight kind of goes his way.

[Speaker 4]
Do we get a surprise round?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I don't think so. I think you guys waffled a little bit too much and this one's going to be like... Yeah.

Jesus.

[Speaker 4]
Hey, welcome to the low rolls club.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Perfectly cut screens.

[Speaker 3]
Is my initiative only plus three? Is it always plus three? Oh yeah, because dexterity.

Okay. That makes sense. I am too used to Pathfinder.

[Speaker 1]
I feel you. Okay. Come on, Jesus.

Okay. Uh, I'm also going to adjust the light level of the scene.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, we're in so much trouble.

[Speaker 1]
It's supposed to be like just night, but at the same time. There we go. Oh, that's why it's...

Okay. No, I figured it out. Uh, I don't need the...

[Speaker 7]
Oh, Jesus.

[Speaker 1]
No, it does. Man, what the fuck? Why is the...

I'm sorry. It's like there's token vision in Fog of War. It's not supposed to be Vision of Darkness.

He said Fog of War, please. The problem is, now I can barely see anything on my screen. I don't know why.

I'm just going to ignore it. I'm just going to ignore it. I'll figure it out.

Alright, so this drow how its captain is going to turn around and attack Para. Can do. Scimitar.

22 to hit. And 14 to hit.

[Speaker 3]
Only the 22 hits.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Total of 22 damage.

[Speaker 3]
And...

[Speaker 1]
Whip attack is a bonus action.

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to reroll that one. Because that was supposed to be an advantage anyway.

[Speaker 1]
There you go.

[Speaker 3]
So I think that means that the spell gets lost?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no. At 12, that succeeds.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Oh, is that a success at 10? Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
Mhm. Well, success at 11, technically, but you're good.

[Speaker 5]
How much of an adult 36 damage though?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's 4 each time you get hit.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so I need to roll it again.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, now I'm blind. Yes. Okay, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, second drow house captain is going to continue. He's going to start running over here because he can't actually see me. Not paying attention just yet.

Alright, uh, that brings us to Para.

[Speaker 3]
So I have that on concentration.

[Speaker 2]
And you can move it whenever you want.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, can I move that one?

[Speaker 2]
Yep. As a bonus action, you can move it up to 60 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I can. Um... When it appears.

Okay. Um... Then...

You guys want me to move the light over here, or is that a bad idea?

[Speaker 2]
Where do you want it?

[Speaker 4]
Well, like, if I put it... I would leave it where it is for now.

[Speaker 2]
Are we trying to stop something from... Can we get it from that direction? I can't see.

[Speaker 1]
Gotta make a decision fast.

[Speaker 4]
There's an Inquisitor and a Displacer beast.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. Yeah, you're right.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm just going to attack the guy in front of me. Um... Ah, come on.

Let me do things. Um... I am going to use Sacred Flame.

Oh. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

I clicked it. Oh. Yeah, okay.

And Para's going to squeak as a bonus action.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
And I think that's everything.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. He has been squeaked. This Drowhouse Captain starts off in the Dawn and can't even really...

can't even really see anything. But I need his... I need him to get...

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
And your turn. Okay, so he's just going to run outside of the Dawn in a panic. Drowned Shadowblade over here is going to have a little bit of courage.

He's going to go over and attack Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, that was the damage roll?

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 5]
That's alright. These guys are fucking mean.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to go over and attack the... Wolf. There's a 14 here.

No. Alrighty. And he's going to turn the third attack back to you.

Alrighty. Drowned Mage is going to move himself and his mount this way.

[Speaker 7]
And then we come to Maia.

[Speaker 5]
Maia's going to Shadow Step to behind this guy to attack it. The first one has the damage. Hits.

2d6 Sneak attack extra. It's the Nikita Stunning Strike. Ayy!

I'll make a second attack with Kuno. Nice. That's Maia done.

Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
Why does your critical hit do less damage?

[Speaker 5]
Sneak attack was on the first one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I'm fortunate.

[Speaker 1]
This guy's going to hold his action. I'm going to Drowned Guard. I'm going to walk over to this place.

And... I'm going to attack Para. 2 damage.

It's his turn. Alright, we come to Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. Let's see here. I think, yeah, we need some reinforcements here, I think.

So, no time for niceties. And... Yes, Suffered Owls.

More owls. And... I'll just roll for the initial.

[Speaker 4]
All the owls.

[Speaker 2]
1d20. Oh, wait, that might have been plus 2 for the dex bonus, I think. I think.

I want to say it's 2.

[Speaker 1]
If you're going to conjure creatures, make sure that you have their stats right in front of you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah, I should do that. Oh, wait, no, it's Giant Owl.

So, yeah, summon 8 of those buggers. So...

[Speaker 1]
I just imported a Giant Owl stat block into your...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, did you? Yeah, into your thing there. Yeah, probably going to use Giant Owls a lot.

Where would I find that?

[Speaker 1]
It's in your folder, in Actors.

[Speaker 2]
Where can I get that from? I'm not seeing it. Should be...

[Speaker 1]
It's in his folder, so it should.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't see it. Oh, there it is. Thank you.

So... I think that would go before me.

[Speaker 1]
They're going on your initiative, just drop them on the board, because we've got to keep this moving.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. And then Mimosa is on deck.

[Speaker 4]
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Birds are us. Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3 more.

[Speaker 1]
Just make one attack and damage roll for each one.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Alright. Okay, Birds are us.

And first, before that, I have my wolf attack this guy, because that was not nice of him, attacking me like that. Oh, yep. Hits.

Alright. And, okay, so we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of them that's in range of somebody's attack, so that would be 5 attacks with a plus 3 defense. So...

Oh, wait, actually, these guys already have their own stepbox, don't they? Yes, I don't actually have to do that manually. That's fantastic.

Oh, you have an attack. Yeah, that's a foul. I'm not going to bother rolling for damage yet.

Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Anything else to return?

[Speaker 2]
No, that would be me, so I'll just roll the attacks and stuff, so if anyone wants to go about doing their business. And this guy's going to seal. Another attack.

Yeah, that's a foul. So 9 damage to this top guy. And 2 for this other one down here.

I don't know if that hits, but it doesn't.

[Speaker 1]
I said to just roll 1 attack and 1 damage roll for each one. For the whole...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay, because they're all kind of spread out, see?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I gotcha.

[Speaker 2]
And they wouldn't be able to all fit on one thing anyway, so on one enemy, because they're all too small and they're all large creatures, so I'm just having the ones that are underlings that make attacks. 14? I don't know if that hits.

[Speaker 1]
No, the point was, I have to move to... We've got to keep the thing moving.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but I've already made all the attacks, so...

[Speaker 1]
Now it's fine. Anyways, Mimosa, go ahead. That hits.

That definitely hits. You would have sneaked his attack.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I was not sure.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, anytime that you don't have disadvantage and you have allies within 5 feet...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, I also squeaked him!

[Speaker 1]
Yes, you also have advantage advantage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, fair.

[Speaker 2]
And I'm also going to add another 1d6 to that as well.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 3]
I forgot I squeaked that man.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, Mimosa definitely has more than 1d6 sneak attack at this point, right?

[Speaker 3]
Is it not out of the upper that sneak attack?

[Speaker 6]
I don't know.

[Speaker 5]
A pure rogue?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's a level 8 rogue.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. That'll be 4, I think. At least 4 or 5.

[Speaker 6]
Well then I will just do a... I'll do a 3d6 because I already did a d6.

[Speaker 2]
Is that right? Yeah, 4d6.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
18?

[Speaker 6]
14, yeah. 14 plus 13. 27.

[Speaker 1]
27 plus the 6 from Robin, so that would be 33. Hefty hit. Alrighty, is that the end of your turn?

Yep.

[Speaker 6]
Well, she'll just be like, you guys are doing great!

[Speaker 4]
We're all doing great. Good job.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Forona, you are up.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. I'm going to use one of my spells from the wreath for the first time and cast Eyebite.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. Interesting.

[Speaker 4]
So... I'm going to use it on the Shadowblade here first and go with the Panic.

[Speaker 1]
It makes it, but as I recall, Eyebite doesn't go away if something makes their save.

[Speaker 4]
Correct. It is Concentration.

[Speaker 1]
You're still able to use it on other people. Sweet.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah. You just can't use it on the same target. You can switch targets though.

Awesome spell. I love it. It's a cool spell.

I've never seen it used, actually, to be honest.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, bonus action, Hirelings?

[Speaker 4]
Yes. I don't have the sprite with me, but I do have the Wand of Wonder, which I'm going to break out just because things are crazy. 17...

It casts Gust of Wind. 60 feet long, 10 feet wide. So I'm going to have that go Come on.

There? There? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so targeting these two guys.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 5]
They Strip Row.

[Speaker 1]
So that guy will move on the start of his next turn.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 4]
I think so, yes. I don't think I have any useful bonus actions.

[Speaker 1]
This Displacer Beast is going to run out of the thing. Can't really see the combat from there. Purple Worm already went with its master.

Growl Inquisitor is also going to follow suit. Desperately trying to get out of the thing. Growlhouse Captain is going to attack, let's see here, is going to attack Mimosa.

[Speaker 6]
No thank you.

[Speaker 1]
He's doing it.

[Speaker 6]
I get away from that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, because you have Scout.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, I think it's Skirmisher. Oh, I can remove. Oh, no.

Sentinel? Nope, it's I read it, but I just read everything, so.

[Speaker 5]
Throw your Scout.

[Speaker 6]
I think it's Invasion.

[Speaker 5]
It's the Dodge. What is it?

[Speaker 6]
Uncanny Dodge? No.

[Speaker 1]
Skirmisher is what I think you were thinking of.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, when the inlet is within 5 feet of you, you can move away at half your speed.

[Speaker 1]
So when he ends his turn in a moment, he'll be able to do it. Does an 18 hit you? Well, I've done 21.

And then the last one is going to go to Para with a 18 again. Alright, so 45 damage.

[Speaker 3]
Is that the same? Oh, it is him. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, 45 damage. Most of which is poison. I don't know if you have a resistance to that.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, both his hits were to me?

[Speaker 1]
No, no, those were to Mimosa. Oh. And then, does an 18 hit Para?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, an 18 hits Para.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, 19 damage to Para.

[Speaker 6]
I do have Uncanny Dodge.

[Speaker 1]
If you want to have either of those. Yeah. Oh, I see.

Oh, I see. Alright, in any case, that is his turn. This guy is next to a bunch of owls that he's going to run past so they can make attacks of opportunity.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. I still haven't played him, so that seems to be enough. So, attack one.

Oh, nice. Oh, wait. So that was meant to be a crit, so I'll reroll that damage.

That's boring. Okay. And one more attack.

Do-do-do. Oh, and I'll copy that. So, do-do-do-do.

22 points of damage.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he's going to make two attacks versus the owl here.

[Speaker 2]
Okie. Somehow that misses, yeah. These guys are not hard to hit.

That does hit though.

[Speaker 1]
Okie. Almost 17 damage.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yep. That almost kills him.

[Speaker 1]
That is his turn. Para!

[Speaker 3]
Okie dokie. Well, bonus action, I'm going to move the dawn right here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, hang on. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that because I just realized that's going to hurt everybody here.

Yeah, but it also does when it starts there. I, for some reason, was like, yeah, there's no friendly fire, it's fine. I don't know where I was thinking there's no friendly fire.

That's a thing.

[Speaker 4]
Pathfinder.

[Speaker 3]
Pathfinder has it too. You have friendly fire, there's nothing I think. That's video games.

Anyway. This guy is going to get What am I doing? What am I doing?

All of them are so, there's so many spells. He is going to get inflicted wounds, right?

[Speaker 1]
Already.

[Speaker 3]
But bonus action, I'm going to squeak first.

[Speaker 1]
What level are you casting this at?

[Speaker 3]
Fourth level. Maybe that's excessive, but also, screw this guy.

[Speaker 1]
That hits. He's got ten hit points left.

[Speaker 3]
He's also been squeaked, so Oops.

[Speaker 1]
You saw it too, didn't you? This trial guard just had a bunch of giant owls spawn right before right in front of him, so he's going to go the other way. Housecaptain over here, he's going to skirt around the edge here, he's going to dash.

The Shadowblade is going to attack Maya first.

[Speaker 5]
He saved him in the back. Eighteen hits. I'm not a real monk, I take poison damage.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to attack Robin next. That misses. Robin again.

You've got to make a DC 17 constitution saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
This monk checks something, I don't think I don't think it's going to help, but absorb elements? I thought it was necrotic damage.

[Speaker 5]
No, I think it's just the elemental ones, but I could be wrong.

[Speaker 2]
But what it reasons does not say. That's really helpful, thanks. Oh wait, here we go, we actually take out the other necrotic element.

Unfortunate. OK, just wanted to see if I could reduce that damage, but no.

[Speaker 5]
OK, let's see if I roll Is that the end of his turn? That is the end of his turn, yeah. I'm going to use Skywisher to move away.

OK, how do I how do I, well no, I'll just get rid of them I suppose.

[Speaker 2]
Dip, dip, dip, dip dip, dip, dip, dip I either drown mages up That's a bastard. That's a bastard.

[Speaker 1]
He's going to command all of the, he's going to yell at all of the folks here to go defend the crystal. He and the worm are going to tunnel into the earth He's making a literal wormhole. You folks are going to fall and make us a little worm space.

A little worm space under the earth. And that is going to be his turn. We come now to Maya.

[Speaker 5]
What sort of wall am I up against? Is this just like foliage and Yeah, pretty much. physical wall.

So like any trees I can climb up and hide in.

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely. That's easy.

[Speaker 5]
In that case then, am I able to see the displacer beast?

[Speaker 1]
Probably. Especially if you just move a little bit.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. I want to use all of my movement to go up into the trees. I'm going to throw my dune eye at them.

[Speaker 4]
What are you, a monk of the lorax?

[Speaker 5]
Does an 18 hit the displacer beast?

[Speaker 1]
Sure does.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I'd have disadvantage.

[Speaker 1]
You would have disadvantage, because it's one of my favorite creatures.

[Speaker 5]
That 18 would have hit still and that would break its displacement. I'm going to climb up into the tree and use my bonus action to hide if that's okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's totally fine.

[Speaker 5]
My damage. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Meantime, this drow guard is still here. He's going to attack Barret. He misses.

[Speaker 2]
Robin! What exactly is going on here?

[Speaker 1]
You guys have sunken into a room beneath the ground, or beneath the surface. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Is it a room? Or just a tunnel that the worm was excavating?

[Speaker 1]
It's mostly just a tunnel that the worm was excavating.

[Speaker 2]
All right. So, my bonus action, I'm going to have my wolf attack this guy. Displaced for reference.

Okay, that probably hits. And I'm going to use my action to disengage. And I'll just grab both ends of my cloak and fly the fuck away.

And I can do that at 40 foot flight speed. So, I can pretty much just fly out of the hole, I assume. Sure.

Okay. I will do that. Just get some gravity, because I am not helpful for anyone if I'm dead.

And I can't do anything else, unfortunately.

[Speaker 7]
All right. Mimosa. Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Well, I'm sorry, you hear my child screaming.

[Speaker 1]
It's okay. You're fine.

[Speaker 4]
Is it intentional or incidental that your halflings sound like they're from Minnesota?

[Speaker 6]
It's accidental. It's accidental.

[Speaker 4]
Halflings would totally be in the hot pot. Oh, no hot dish, isn't it?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know. I'm not from there.

[Speaker 4]
It's like a casserole, but with tater tots in it.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, no, I do know that. I just... That's not what I know it as.

[Speaker 8]
Okay.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, okay. I'm taking that doesn't hit.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, you have advantage. He's squeaked!

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay. I almost asked.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I wish I could do something that makes him actually look like he's squeaked.

[Speaker 7]
Hell yeah.

[Speaker 3]
And you get your sneak attack. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. And that's... This guy up here?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he's super dead.

[Speaker 6]
She goes, let's get out of here. Oh, there's one behind her. Never mind, she doesn't do that.

I forgot. Never mind.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, she could do that turn around, see the guy.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Alright, let's get out of here. Oh, okay.

Alright, well... You're next. That's my turn.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, is that the end of your turn? Alright, cool, cool, cool.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, that's all I can do.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Karuba.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'm gonna try the Eyebite on the Purple Worm.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Purple Worm is going to...

[Speaker 2]
This is gonna be interesting.

[Speaker 1]
The Wisdom Save, that's right. Okay, I'm gonna have him... I'm just gonna do it from here.

Why the fuck does a Purple Worm have proficiency in Wisdom Saving throws?

[Speaker 4]
Yes! That is a failure! It has to take the dash action and...

Well, on its turn. Take the dash action and move away by the safest and shortest route available.

[Speaker 2]
And take his Light of Wisdom, hopefully.

[Speaker 1]
Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't have any... No, I'm gonna use the Animated Wand of Wonder again.

[Speaker 1]
Already?

[Speaker 4]
94... 94... Shimmering Light.

So, everybody needs to make DC 15 Con Saves.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, this is just a comedy of ears.

[Speaker 6]
What is this?

[Speaker 3]
So, we have, like, basically a Wand of Wild Magic, it feels like. So everyone's gotta make a Con Save. Or be blinded.

Be the one player who gets it.

[Speaker 2]
Well, mine is fine. Saving throw? Oh.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, hang on. Can I up a Constitution roll? With my Herb de Dace?

Can you up everybody's Con rolls? Um, no, I'm gonna be a little selfish stinker. Uh, let's see.

11 and I need a 15. I'm gonna spend two of my Herb Dice for that.

[Speaker 5]
Can you do multiple with Herb Dice, actually? I don't remember. Doesn't take a pretty good action.

What, does it? What? Up a roll?

[Speaker 3]
Well, yeah, but do I want to spend all my dice on that?

[Speaker 5]
Oh.

[Speaker 4]
Um, did you have the Mage and Worm roll too? Because it would be everybody down here.

[Speaker 3]
Does a worm have eyes to blind?

[Speaker 8]
Yay.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. I have made it. I am not blinded, thankfully.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, shit. I was muted. Sorry, what was that?

[Speaker 4]
Um, it has blind sight, but it doesn't say it has immunity to blindness, basically.

[Speaker 2]
It's the same difference. Even if you're blind, it wouldn't make a difference.

[Speaker 6]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
The Mage didn't.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he didn't roll.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, he's got a... That thing's gonna run up there. Um...

There's also... Alright, and the, uh... Purple Worm's running away.

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the Drought House Captain apparently blinded. Uh, he's gonna swing wildly at Miracle. We're about to find out.

[Speaker 6]
No. He gets one. Alright, he gets one.

Which I think I will uncanny dodge.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. That brings us to Para.

[Speaker 6]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Um... Oh, um, at the end of your turn, you need to repeat the saving throw.

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna have him repeat that save. Alright, cool, cool, cool. It makes it!

No good blinding.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, I'm gonna remove my Dawn, since... Um... That's that.

And then I'm gonna do the spell that I think I actually was thinking of. And I'm gonna cast it at 5th level.

[Speaker 7]
Ho ho ho ho!

[Speaker 3]
Spirit Guardians! And let's see, I am... It is a 15 foot aura around me, so let me make an aura around me.

15, and it's gotta be pink.

[Speaker 1]
Most excellent. Alright, so the goddess is gonna die.

[Speaker 3]
Um... In a bonus action, I believe I can squeak... Oh god.

Do I want to squeak the mage, or the other guy?

[Speaker 1]
Um... The mage is blinded right now. So he already has...

All attacks against him already have advantage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Alright, well I'll squeak the captain.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Is that the end of your turn?

[Speaker 3]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Drow Shadowblade is going to... Attack the dog. At disadvantage?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, the dog's also blind, so I think there might be a disadvantage as well.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like... He doesn't know the dog's there, so I feel like...

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like it has to be disadvantage. Even if he's attacking somebody who is... Who is themselves blinded, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. That's a... Damn, that's...

Ooh. Yeah, there's still a lot, but... Alright.

So... Twelve.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and he's no longer blinded. Alright, that brings us to the Drow Mage, who's just going to end his turn.

[Speaker 2]
He can't really do it.

[Speaker 3]
And he has to make the Spirit Guardian save again on his start of his turn.

[Speaker 2]
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Oh, and the... So does the Shadowblade, because he also was blinded.

Correct.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, already, so...

[Speaker 2]
I have damage on that. Twelve?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, neither of them are looking too good, though. So he's just going to end his turn and try to save again. Nope.

Just unlikely to go well. He doesn't have a bonus. Alright, Maia!

Anything you would like to do? Might I just see these guys have been, like, they're all just, like, running.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yes.

[Speaker 1]
You can probably see some of your allies from where you're currently sitting.

[Speaker 4]
Stumbling around, blinded.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and I'm flying up in the air here.

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to cast Darkness.

[Speaker 2]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

[Speaker 5]
I'm going to teleport down into it. Would that break stealth? Because I can Shadow Step sixty feet into the...

[Speaker 1]
I don't think it would.

[Speaker 5]
You would still be hit. I don't think the spell... I would, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Alrighty. Brings us to Robin. Okay-dokey.

I'm going to use my bonus action to have my swarm keep me aloft. Yes, I whip out my bow and I'm going to... and I can still see the mage from here, so I'll just move my token back over here.

I can? No, I can't move my... Just roll your attack.

Yeah, I'm just... Just roll your attack. Roll your attack.

Yeah, I'm just going to... I'm trying to. I have to be able to see the target, so I'm not...

[Speaker 1]
No, you just go into your inventory or features and then just...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I know, like, his token was literally not visible. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You don't have to see his token or roll the attack.

[Speaker 2]
I think he might be dead.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he's definitely dead. Which I knew was going to happen, so I was like, just roll.

[Speaker 2]
Just roll. Yep.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And I want to get revenge on... Wait, why can't I target you? I'm trying to target this other guy.

Okay. Oh, because I'm pressing the wrong button. That would be why.

And this guy's just a normal wall, I think. So... Not sure if that hits.

[Speaker 1]
That's a Shadow Blade. Just misses.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I figured that might be the case. Otherwise, I'm going to stay there and laugh until the wolf can't do anything because I think it just takes a dodge action.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, it can make a constitution save at the end of its turn. That brings us to Mimosa Marigold.

[Speaker 2]
No. Still blind.

[Speaker 6]
Don't forget, he is squeaked. I was just about to ask that.

[Speaker 3]
So you have advantage.

[Speaker 6]
That hits, right?

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah. Absolutely. Apply damage.

Yeah, he's not looking too healthy.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. We'll see on his turn how he's faring.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, do I have to roll for the blinded thing? Or am I good? No, because you're not blinded.

Yeah, you're good.

[Speaker 1]
Also, let's see here. Hirota.

[Speaker 6]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
Alright. Since I used Eye Bite successfully on someone else, can I try it again on the Shadow Blade?

[Speaker 2]
You've already used it on him, so you can't target him again, but you can target this other guy.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, I'll go ahead and target him, so he needs to make a DC 17 Wisdom. He's good. Alright, so that's with him.

Do I have my spellbook? I'm gonna go ahead and do... Let's do...

Poison Spray. Okay. And I have advantage, right?

[Speaker 1]
He is... Oh, yes you do, he is Squeaked. That hits.

[Speaker 3]
I think that is my favorite Cobalt ability. Oh.

[Speaker 6]
That's a really good one.

[Speaker 1]
That's why it's not...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I forgot I was... I forgot to make some damage there.

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 2]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
Am I blind or not?

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you are.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. We'll just go with that. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, and then the Purple Worm is no longer Eye Bitten, right?

[Speaker 4]
It has to... It has to go 60 feet away from me, and then it is no longer frightened.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, because it did that last round.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's when the... So I imagine that's when the effect would end.

[Speaker 4]
If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away where it can no longer see you, the effect ends.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. There he comes back! Well, the closest creature is Para.

No, it just has a ridiculous movement speed.

[Speaker 4]
Dead?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 4]
That's not my question. My question is it's an animal.

[Speaker 1]
No, sorry. What did you say? I just lost connection to the Foundry server again.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, I heard something.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, I might be back. Can you guys hear me?

[Speaker 7]
There you are.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I was... Yeah, I kept losing connection.

My internet cut out.

[Speaker 3]
Well, that was good timing, though.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, sorry. What was the question?

[Speaker 4]
So, my question is, it's an animal. Why is it coming back?

[Speaker 1]
It's not just any animal. It is a purple worm that has been magically dominated and trained for a specific purpose. If this were a horse, then probably yes.

[Speaker 2]
Dash back to where we were?

[Speaker 3]
It had to move 60 feet.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I was getting at it. So, it can come back, but it would have to take the dash action.

[Speaker 1]
Because it has... No, you're right, because it would have to do 50... or 60...

It only has 50 movement speed.

[Speaker 7]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
It was forced to take the dash action, even though it ends.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Just because it was forced to take the dash action doesn't mean that it was forced to move the full 60 feet of that dash.

[Speaker 4]
That is such an ill-faith argument.

[Speaker 1]
But it had to make the dash action back to get back here, so it's not going to... It doesn't matter either way. Alright, we come to the Trial House Captain, that I've refreshed once again.

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Make a wisdom save.

[Speaker 7]
Make a wish.

[Speaker 1]
It came true! Alright, Para, how much damage did you do to this poor man?

[Speaker 3]
My DC is 18.

[Speaker 1]
Well, he still takes half damage.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's true. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Uh...

[Speaker 3]
Alright, where's my damage button? Where's my damage button? Damage button.

[Speaker 2]
Still chunky damage though.

[Speaker 1]
He's got literally...

[Speaker 3]
Mr. Purple Worm! You need to make a save too!

[Speaker 2]
He does! Yeah, that's difficult terrain he walked into. What's difficult terrain?

[Speaker 6]
I just stare from the back like, Whoa!

[Speaker 1]
Purple Worm fails.

[Speaker 2]
That was a good spell.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this guy's just going to run.

[Speaker 4]
Now I'm imagining the song Hey Mr. Sandman, but it's Hey Mr. Purple Worm.

[Speaker 1]
Mimosa, would you like to make an attack of opportunity?

[Speaker 6]
Who's getting what? Nessie. Nessie.

[Speaker 4]
Nessie?

[Speaker 6]
No, I'm here. It's just my headphones.

[Speaker 4]
Nessie, I'm here.

[Speaker 6]
He didn't click off. Alright, do I still have advantage?

[Speaker 3]
Technically, because it's not my turn yet. Yeah!

[Speaker 8]
That hits?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, he's dead. There's no way you can't kill him. If you roll a one on every single die, he is still dead twice over.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, Para!

[Speaker 4]
This is the best way to kill your enemies.

[Speaker 2]
It is your turn.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, uh, Big Worm, don't like it. Um, Oh gosh, what am I going to do to this worm? What am I going to do to the worm?

All of my good spells are concentration.

[Speaker 6]
All my thoughts are don't get eaten by it, so.

[Speaker 3]
Well, if it eats me, I will make it have hell of a digestion. I'm going to squeak it, and then I am going to cast Flicked Wounds. Does that hit a worm?

[Speaker 1]
It has an AC of 18.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, eat that worm.

[Speaker 1]
He's eating.

[Speaker 2]
He's eating well.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. Draw Shadow Blade. Is that at the start of his turn that he has the thing?

[Speaker 3]
It's at the start of the turn, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, go ahead and roll your damage.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, let me scroll up. I wish I could just have it loading somewhere.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, he's dead.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, uh, we're going to take a quick break, because I'm starving, and I finished some food. I need to get some food.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, I'll be back.

[Speaker 6]
Why is there an Amethyst Dragon on the combat rolls?

[Speaker 4]
Hey, don't worry about it!

[Speaker 6]
It's fine. It's a friend. It's okay.

[Speaker 3]
It's more than a friend. It's a nemesis.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I feel like that's a reference I'm not understanding.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's just a weird thing I'm saying.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. I can never tell with you guys.

[Speaker 3]
I guess it could be a reference to the fact that I am big into enemy lover-er- enemy lovers, yeah. Yeah. Hello, Dex.

What are you doing? Why are you giving me that look? You have such owlish eyes.

You look like you're constantly shocked by everything.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my cat has that face too.

[Speaker 6]
Not nearly as bad as Zina. Her eyes vibrate. They wiggle really, yeah.

When she stares sometimes, her eyes just move side to side really quickly. I have a video of it, but it's been such a long time. I don't know where I would find it.

But it is a Siamese genetic condition. Like when they go cross-eyed, except that her eyes wiggle. And they're not cross-eyed.

[Speaker 4]
My first cat was cross-eyed. Yeah. She was just a mildly inbred calico though.

I feel like the song Hey Mr. Purple Worm would appear on a Weird Al D&D album. Which, by the way, I would pay a lot of money for.

[Speaker 3]
It almost makes me think of Mr. Purple People Eater. Which, I suppose one could say a worm very much is a purple people eater, but I don't think the description fits a worm.

[Speaker 4]
Oh god, can you imagine if somebody cast fly on a purple worm?

[Speaker 2]
That would be amazing.

[Speaker 3]
Can we tame a purple worm? Is this our new goal, guys?

[Speaker 2]
This purple worm has really been tamed before.

[Speaker 3]
Do purple worms count as dragons? Can we get those dragon hunters to catch us a purple worm instead? And then we just...

Do I have access to fly? That's not a cleric spell. Who has access to fly?

I don't know what wizards and sorcerers do.

[Speaker 2]
And warlocks too, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Artificer, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
God, that is such a funny idea, though.

[Speaker 4]
What?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's not a spider.

[Speaker 2]
Also, a fun fact about that Eyebite is that since it failed to save you in Attack of the Deacons What was your...

[Speaker 4]
What did you say?

[Speaker 2]
You know with Eyebite, though, that you can't target the same thing if they succeed and save, but if it's failed to save, you can do it again. Oh!

[Speaker 4]
You said you can target a vegan. Oh yeah, you can target a vegan with anything.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we offended the vegan. I don't know if he actually was. But the timing.

I actually like vegan food. It's got its place. Some of it's good.

As long as they're not trying to be something that they're not.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, as long as they don't do the weird chemically additives or whatever. I'm gonna be right back.

[Speaker 2]
Have a good day.

[Speaker 3]
So my work has me clocking in now. And it's really weird.

[Speaker 6]
Do you have to clock out when you're done with a client and then clock back in?

[Speaker 3]
No. I literally just stay clocked in until my break and then I clock out. But I had someone cancel on me today and I was like do I stay clocked in or do I clock out?

And the guy doesn't have any idea. He walked in and he was like, they didn't tell me anything about this.

[Speaker 4]
Oh weird.

[Speaker 6]
I almost said those exact words to my son. Except I replaced Dinky with Messy.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my god, the biscuit.

[Speaker 6]
I know. I dusted him off like 10 minutes before I looked at him again and he was so messy. This is what you get for boys.

[Speaker 3]
I'm back. Though Rosemary's also just as messy with that biscuit. I think that's just...

[Speaker 6]
It was a biscuit, it was crumbly. It was a crumbly biscuit, it got everywhere.

[Speaker 3]
And then tomorrow I have to deal with the office lady that I don't like, so that'll be fun. Because she is probably going to be on everyone's ass about clocking in and out. It's just weird because it's like, it's not like I'm paid by the hour.

[Speaker 1]
Oh my god. Alright, I'm no longer in physical pain.

[Speaker 7]
Welcome back. We missed you.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. Where do we leave off? We have Maiev.

[Speaker 5]
Did these guys stay in the darkness?

[Speaker 1]
You know what? They're still in the darkness as of this moment, yeah. Most excellent.

Definitely is.

[Speaker 5]
I think this gets sneaky because it's con based. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to take dodge bonus action.

[Speaker 1]
After that, all of them are going to, I guess, run even faster. That brings us to Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie. I can see the purple worm now, so I am going to bonus action, Zephyr Strike. And then I'm going to target that worm and I'm going to shoot it in the goddamn face.

Thank you. This will give me advantage on that first roll. Okay, yeah, I assume that hits.

That's a normal roll. Okay, that's regular damage. That's plus an additional D8 on force.

I'm also going to use my favorite foe on it to get another D6. Uh huh. And then I have my swarm to get another D6.

So that's another 10, 14, on top of the original 26, so 14 on top of 26. Yeah, 14. And I still have one more attack to go because why the hell not.

Yep. And is this favorite foe once per turn, or is it... Yeah, first time on it this turn, yeah.

So just another 27 on top of that. Alrighty. I can't really do much more than that.

My wolf just runs around chasing its own tail because it's still blind, so I'll just make another save for it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, cool. I'm going to grab the cat. Uh, Mimosa, you are on deck.

[Speaker 6]
Ah, it's no longer blind. Yay! Did the worm get squeaked?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Yes, the worm was squeaked.

[Speaker 6]
So... I'm going to tip my toe up to it.

[Speaker 2]
Oh! I'm shanking the kidney.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah, I should leave my chin there. Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Let's leave him. Alright, Mimosa, what have you got for us?

[Speaker 6]
Nope. Nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, do you want to try with your bonus action?

[Speaker 6]
I was going to say, I could probably luck it if it didn't already apply it. That's all good. I don't know what I'd be able to do with my bonus action.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, you can make a...

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can make a second attack with your bonus action. It just won't get the ability modifier. Uh, but it will get your sneak attack.

[Speaker 2]
Hits!

[Speaker 1]
That'll be... 13, 7... Yeah.

A total of 14. Oh, cool. Alright, that brings us to Corona.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, um, I'm going to eyebite the purple worm again. Um, so it needs to make a new um, wisdom roll.

[Speaker 7]
Alrighty. He's done. So, what would you like him to do this time, by the way, again?

[Speaker 4]
Um... Yeah, because the other options aren't as good.

[Speaker 2]
Um... Yeah, and then the other two can get opportunity attacks on him as he runs away.

[Speaker 7]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 2]
He still takes the damage from Terra's bubble.

[Speaker 4]
But...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Um, and then can I use my action to try and climb out of the hole?

[Speaker 1]
Um... Uh, sure. What's your movement speed?

[Speaker 4]
What is my movement speed? That's a good question.

[Speaker 1]
It's like 30 feet. It'll take you... I don't see a climb speed, so it'll take you two turns to get out of it.

[Speaker 4]
Alright.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, purple worm's turn. It dashes away.

[Speaker 3]
It also has to make another wisdom save?

[Speaker 1]
It does have to make another wisdom save.

[Speaker 2]
And Nissa gets to make an opportunity attack.

[Speaker 1]
As does Pera. You succeeded, Nissa.

[Speaker 3]
How much, uh...

[Speaker 1]
It's just like 5d8, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
And it's still... I still have advantage on it, right?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yes. Yes, you sure do.

[Speaker 1]
Hits?

[Speaker 6]
Lame.

[Speaker 1]
Aw, it misses. Alright. So the adult amethyst right now.

That brings us back to Pera.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Um... The purple worm just left, right?

Like, it's gone?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's probably gonna come back. It's next turn. Yeah.

I think it's just movement.

[Speaker 3]
Um... I don't know how I would do that on the map.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I moved to the edge of the hole to indicate it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Uh... That...

[Speaker 4]
He just said it takes two turns, so... I wanted to go to the edge and wanted to climb up it.

[Speaker 8]
Okay. Pretty much.

[Speaker 1]
Does he have a climb speed?

[Speaker 3]
I don't.

[Speaker 1]
Oh no! Alright. Will that be the end of your turn?

[Speaker 7]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alright. So that would bring us to Maia.

[Speaker 2]
Maia...

[Speaker 5]
Ooh. Oh, sorry. I was muted.

Um, I'm gonna target this one. Oh, already? Uh, they have not.

I'm gonna fire the full five bolts from the crossbow. Assume a twenty-nine hits. Absolutely.

Let's sneak attack this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Also, I think the module that you sent me, I think I applied it to the Lancer game instead of the 5e game. Like an absolute fucking idiot. I applied it to the wrong world.

But, uh, alright, that's a hefty hit. It's... She's not doing great.

[Speaker 5]
I can detect him. Ah, I love it. Miss.

[Speaker 1]
You rolled a one and a two. That is incredible.

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okie dokie.

[Speaker 4]
Um... You could fly down and pick us up.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I can. I can't fly very quickly, mind you, but, um... So...

Is it borrowing underground? Can I not see it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can't see it right now.

[Speaker 2]
But I can see this displacement piece. So... Sure, why not?

It's available as a target. So I will shoot him in the head.

[Speaker 5]
It has its displacement effect on.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. Wait, didn't you hit it? Is it each turn against each attacker or is it just until it's turned...

[Speaker 1]
It hasn't been hit in, like, three turns, so...

[Speaker 2]
So every person who attacks it is, um...

[Speaker 1]
No, it hasn't been hit in three turns.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. Oh, so... Oh, okay, you're targeting the drow.

Okay, I can see him. Because even though I'm 40 feet up, I'm still getting to the walls. So, okay.

[Speaker 1]
No worries.

[Speaker 2]
If that's what you're shooting at. Because I want to see the same thing you're shooting at.

[Speaker 1]
No, it'll probably work out really well. You can probably kill this thing. Oh, 28 definitely hits.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. Getting closer. Okay, nice, we have another.

Yeah, that's not a great shot. 14 misses, it looks like. Oh, and on the first hit, at least 6 because...

Bit, bit, bit, bit. Um, as for my wolf, I will tell it to basically just move up a bit and hold its action in case the purple one comes back and just attack it if it comes back. Okay.

Sounds good. And I'll float down 10 more feet just to get closer to everybody because I'm back into the hole so I can eventually pull them out of it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, Mimosa.

[Speaker 6]
Alright, we're all skedaddling. More or less.

[Speaker 3]
At least getting out of the hole.

[Speaker 6]
I'll just go my full action to the edge. Oh, itty bitty legs. Right, is this where, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. And Corotta, pretty much just like exit C, I'm going to start pulling you guys out of the hole.

[Speaker 2]
Out of the hole we go.

[Speaker 4]
There. Um, I'm going to leave the Wand of Wonder down in the hole.

[Speaker 6]
No, it's fun!

[Speaker 4]
No, keep it! No, it's fun! Let me finish.

When the purple worm comes back, the Wand of Wonder is going to shoot at it.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. It does come back on this turn because it has to dash to get back.

[Speaker 4]
So should I just roll this now or wait for it to come back?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, go for it. Well, it's turn is up because I had to dash. You can't do anything else.

[Speaker 2]
Alright.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, an 85...

[Speaker 2]
Does it get close enough to my wolf? Or is it...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it just grows leaves. That's disappointing.

[Speaker 6]
Leave it alone.

[Speaker 1]
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

[Speaker 7]
Um... Um... Uh...

[Speaker 4]
Let's see... Um, I'm going to use Eye Bite on the closer Displacer Beast. So roll Wisdom for it, please.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. This one right here, right? Attributes...

[Speaker 4]
This guy, yep. Alright. Failure.

He is frightened and has to run.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Um, and these drow are fleeing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, they're not actually part of the combat right now. I left them behind for a hot second for Landy to shoot at, but after this turn, they're gonna die behind a wall.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Um... What is this?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, there's a bunch of plants and other creatures just kinda like sitting in between the hedges over here.

[Speaker 4]
Oh. Okay, then. Um, then I guess I will um, fire Eldritch Blast at that closest drow.

[Speaker 8]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, geez. Dead. Dead.

Oh, wait, no, I thought that was the damage roll. Probably still dead.

[Speaker 2]
Dead.

[Speaker 4]
Um, then I will fire the second one at the... one of the others.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, if there was a house capped in there, then I would've fired both of them at him.

[Speaker 1]
I... Uh, okay. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
I couldn't see him under the displacer piece.

[Speaker 1]
No, that's fair. It looks like he was, uh... by damage.

Cool.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, that's it.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, that brings us to Hera.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Let's see. And then we are just like up here.

Um... Is that my movement to get up here?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, you got up there last turn.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, okay. Is it 25 or 30? D&D's so weird.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
What is that thing?

[Speaker 2]
Nothing.

[Speaker 4]
That's the thing that I asked about that's just a bunch of animals and plants sitting there.

[Speaker 5]
Yep. Okay. Oh, you can see through it.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I can see through it. I could E.B.D.B. you right now if I wanted.

[Speaker 1]
This is a creature called a gas spore.

[Speaker 4]
It's a... It's a gas spore?

[Speaker 1]
Gas spore.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that makes a lot more sense.

[Speaker 5]
I meant to look like one of those scammatic gamers.

[Speaker 6]
Stop it.

[Speaker 3]
I think for now that's all I do.

[Speaker 6]
Which direction did you go in?

[Speaker 3]
I'm over here. I went around the lump.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Because the blue is a giant hole.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Ta-da!

[Speaker 3]
Ta-da! Yeah. Oh, wait, can I move twice?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, dash action.

[Speaker 3]
Let's move. Okay, I'm gonna dash into the darkness. Hello, I'm here now.

Hello, that is my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. I do love that song.

I should put that...

[Speaker 7]
Who doesn't?

[Speaker 3]
Insane people.

[Speaker 2]
Well, people who just stick to trying to darken however many damn times. Physical projects.

[Speaker 3]
The people who aren't friends with darkness, I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, there we go. The cat has calmed down for a second. Okay.

Alright, that brings us to Maya. Also, like I said, these guys need to be exited at this point. I kept them around so that Maya could fire on them while they were hiding.

But they're just gonna continue fleeing.

[Speaker 5]
The worm's coming back, is it?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you can see it back and down the hall, I think.

[Speaker 5]
You should be able to see it from where you are. Can I see the worm?

[Speaker 1]
You sure can.

[Speaker 5]
Am I hidden from the worm in the darkness?

[Speaker 1]
It has tremorsense and blindsight.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna say no then. I'm just gonna fire across the vault, attack them.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 5]
I'll shadowstep on the spot then to get a bit of an edge to that. I didn't declare vaults.

[Speaker 1]
Well, you must have shot five.

[Speaker 5]
If you say so. If I can attack, I'll shoot five more.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. That brings us down to Robin.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, okay. First I need to be able to see it because I can't target it. Where are you, where are you?

Oh, it's back here. Great, fantastic. I'll move my tokens so I can actually see what's happening.

Fantastic. I am, yep, I'm just gonna look while I speed on it. Um, do-do-do-do.

Uh, huddling around people. Yeah, that looks like a fail. Oop.

[Speaker 8]
That was a fail as well.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, uh, so we're gonna miss. Um, I'll have my wolf run up and give it a bite. Do-do-do-do.

Ah, that's better. That hits. Yep, does a little bit of damage.

It's like biting at its guns. Yeah, yeah. And that's kind of all I can do.

I think I'll just float forward a bit. Keep myself out of its presumable range. I think this thing's fairly large.

I don't know exactly what its reach is, but...

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty. That brings us to Marigold.

[Speaker 8]
Stop.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know how... I don't know how far I can go because I can't do the ruler thing at the same time, so...

[Speaker 1]
That's the other module that got applied to Lancer as opposed to the one I wanted to put up. 25 feet is right over here.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, that's nice.

[Speaker 1]
Interesting. 25 feet.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. I tried to do the bendy thing, but I'm holding myself, so...

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, okay. I was gonna say, you have to use the control button.

[Speaker 6]
You gotta have two hands for that, and I don't have two hands. That's fair. Okay.

It's fine, I'll just... I can't see, I'll feel around for... Tara.

Tara.

[Speaker 3]
Tara just watches as she reaches around.

[Speaker 6]
Darling! Can you help? Alright then, I'll just find my way myself.

[Speaker 1]
Tara, who can see perfectly and is in the darkness.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. I'm super... You're such a sweet darling!

[Speaker 8]
Thank you for helping me! Alright, Karona.

[Speaker 6]
I'll be stranded in the darkness.

[Speaker 3]
She'll be a seeing eye, Para, it's fine.

[Speaker 6]
A little guilt always helps.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, the prince has taken Karona's turn.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna use the Wand of Wonder first. That is... It must make a DC 15 con save.

Fails by 5 or more. It's petrified. Nope, it saved.

[Speaker 2]
That would've been great. That would've been awesome. Yeah, just...

[Speaker 3]
How far does it have to be for me to use my dice?

[Speaker 1]
For the herbalist, I think it's 10 feet.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, is it 10 feet? Yeah, it's 10 feet. Lame.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, so I'm gonna use Eyebite again, and this time it's like, before it was like this unearthly. And now it's just like annoyed, go away.

[Speaker 6]
No, go back to your bed. So, a whiz save.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, wow. How many videos are there?

[Speaker 1]
Alright, this time it's actually just going to like, dive all the way down. Yeah, this time it's actually going to leave, because it has 55 hit points left, which is like 1 fifth.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and I'm also going to bite it out of the ass on the way out. Alrighty. Yeah, I mean eventually survival instinct kicks in.

[Speaker 7]
Alright, so you folks are out of combat.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. I'm going to float over here before I fall and crash into the ground. 10 minutes, I think.

[Speaker 3]
10 minutes. So I'll leave it up for a bit, I guess.

[Speaker 2]
We'll see. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't be surprised if we get another combat capital.

[Speaker 6]
How good are you on healing spells?

[Speaker 3]
How low are you? Because you haven't given me access to your health.

[Speaker 6]
I don't know what that means.

[Speaker 3]
So on your token you can make it so I can hover and see your health, which nobody ever does.

[Speaker 2]
I didn't know I could do that. I can never remember how to do that.

[Speaker 3]
That's because I always did it for you.

[Speaker 6]
Well, then there you go. That's not my fault.

[Speaker 2]
Here we go. It's under resources and then you have display bars and bring a troll and hover it up by anybody.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And you want to make sure you do that for your prototype token in your character sheet because otherwise it goes away every time you move to a new map.

[Speaker 2]
Hover by anybody. There we go.

[Speaker 3]
Are you at zero health?

[Speaker 6]
No. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
Because your health is at like zero. I can't see anything.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe it's not representing the right value.

[Speaker 6]
No. I have 33 left. I probably just did it wrong.

[Speaker 3]
What does it say your bar 1 attribute is?

[Speaker 6]
What?

[Speaker 3]
When you do your token configuration. Oh, there it goes. It's correct now.

[Speaker 6]
Yes, I told you I did it wrong. I was fixing it.

[Speaker 3]
Oh. Unbelievable. Alright, I think Chirona is the only one I can't see.

[Speaker 6]
There we go.

[Speaker 4]
I think I just did it.

[Speaker 3]
Nope, I'm still not seeing it.

[Speaker 4]
Did you do it in your... Did you only do it in the... No, I've got it in the prototype but I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.

[Speaker 3]
The prototype is like when you drag a new one so it won't do it for your current token. Oh, okay. That's fine.

What are you at?

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I'm at full. I never took any damage. Oh, you're at full?

Okay. Yeah. I kept waiting for that shadow blade to stab me and it never happened.

[Speaker 1]
Because I think he missed the... He swung at you twice and he missed.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he was too busy stabbing me.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, how much healing does everyone need? Robin looks like you're almost dead.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Don't worry about my wolf, I'll just be summoning.

[Speaker 3]
Your wolf is at full.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's not. It doesn't matter, I'll just be summoning.

[Speaker 3]
What is your... Let's see. I get 12 times 5 plus 5.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh, that eyeball thing looks cool. Can I use...

[Speaker 3]
What have I done?

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Where are you, wolf? Ah, I'll just lock it up.

[Speaker 3]
55. Okay. So, I am down by 36, so I'm probably going to want to use an actual spell for the healing.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see. Oh, I can be poisoned. That's interesting.

That is very interesting. Okay, that's what we'll do. I'm going to summon my wolf, and this time it's going to be poisonous.

Because... Nope. Nope.

Nope. That's not what I wanted. There we go.

I'm going to pop a pig down the board.

[Speaker 3]
I think I will. I think so.

[Speaker 2]
And this time... Poison.

[Speaker 3]
I wish I knew where my pen kept disappearing to. I always put it in the same spot. That's a makeup brush.

That's not going to help me type.

[Speaker 2]
Why the hell did it close down?

[Speaker 3]
That is a hand drill. That's also not going to help me write. Uh, Nessie, how much are you down by?

[Speaker 6]
Um...

[Speaker 3]
I would do the math normally, but I don't have a pen.

[Speaker 6]
No, it's like... Around 30. 34.

34.

[Speaker 3]
Maya, what are you down by?

[Speaker 5]
I'm missing 25.

[Speaker 3]
25. And then Robin, how much are you down by?

[Speaker 2]
I'm down by... 66. 66.

Alright. Alright.

[Speaker 3]
So, let's see. That means I needed total...

[Speaker 2]
of that. I will change this out to... I'll do that right now.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so I do that. I get to use 62. 62.

That means I need to do 38 left.

[Speaker 2]
I just need to test roll here. Let's see here if it's doing it right. Okay, it's doing it right.

It's just wrong typing at the moment.

[Speaker 5]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Um, that 25 will go to Maya.

[Speaker 2]
62. There you go.

[Speaker 3]
Um... Let's see. And then everybody else is up to full.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay then. Oh, because they have a lot.

[Speaker 6]
We're all up to full? Yep. Thank you!

[Speaker 3]
I'm going to take a zero. There we go. Oh, you've taken the darkness.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that'll end.

[Speaker 7]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 1]
So, what would you folks like to do next?

[Speaker 4]
Um, investigate the creepy thing would be my guess. Do we see any more drow around?

[Speaker 2]
No, from this angle.

[Speaker 3]
They went off this direction.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they all kind of retreated to the north.

[Speaker 3]
We should probably follow them.

[Speaker 2]
Well, then we just have to go around the hole.

[Speaker 1]
Well, they didn't go in the hole. They went over the, uh...

[Speaker 2]
Well, no, they didn't go around the hole.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I getcha.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so they went to the north, pretty much.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, so I am keeping up my spirit guardians. Um, skirting around the hole, do I do anything to that thing? Do I do an oopsie?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's not hostile to you necessarily, so I don't think so.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not gonna shout, but I am gonna wave at the things that are all gathered there.

[Speaker 5]
James, Maya's gonna wave at this little guy. Does he react at all?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, he has like a grim smile. He waves back quickly and then goes back to, uh, just kind of chilling out.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, wave at who?

[Speaker 5]
That was an amethyst down there. Oh. He was like this guy.

[Speaker 4]
I wondered what those were.

[Speaker 5]
That is where my first order of movement gets me, too.

[Speaker 4]
I was waving at the gas spores. Yeah. Did they respond at all?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, they're just gonna blink at you.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. We can talk with them later. Yeah, I'm just curious.

Yeah, I understand. I mean, I can literally talk with them later.

[Speaker 5]
Where are we going next?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, well, I see the space abyss and a dragon. Oh. I'm not sure whether the dragon's on our side or not.

I don't know if drow keep dragons.

[Speaker 3]
I think we've encountered drow on dragons.

[Speaker 1]
What's it?

[Speaker 3]
I haven't encountered this very specific one.

[Speaker 1]
No, you guys killed that one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, did we kill him?

[Speaker 5]
I don't remember. That's where I got the egg from.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It says stop. What's your business here? He's talking.

[Speaker 4]
Stuff. Things.

[Speaker 1]
Choose your next words carefully.

[Speaker 8]
Carefully.

[Speaker 2]
Who's talking?

[Speaker 3]
Probably the drow. Or the dragon.

[Speaker 5]
It's the dragon.

[Speaker 2]
Oh. We're sent by the king of what is it called?

[Speaker 4]
Vanioncairn.

[Speaker 2]
He wanted us to check in with this grove. Apparently the druids have gone missing. Missing?

[Speaker 1]
More like dead.

[Speaker 2]
Well, that explains that. Yeah, we suspected as much given that there are drow everywhere. We wanted to tap into the ley lines here.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. We should have asked.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe.

[Speaker 4]
We were kind of attacked before we had the chance to. Not to seem ungrateful.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, these new guards have been useful in procuring this place, but it appears as though you've made a right mess of them.

[Speaker 4]
Did you kill the druids?

[Speaker 1]
I think I killed one or two. But the drow were responsible for isolating this place. They offered it up to me as a gift.

[Speaker 4]
I wonder what they give in return.

[Speaker 1]
House Marta has a strategic location from which to launch assaults into the overworld. Perhaps more importantly, they can negotiate the expenditure of this ley energy with, well, I believe the whoever was supposed to come up next was Theresia.

[Speaker 4]
Do we know that name?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, some of you do.

[Speaker 5]
That's who Orval was hunting. Orval has been off on an adventure for a very long time at this point.

[Speaker 4]
So who knows the name?

[Speaker 5]
So that would be Maia, I believe, and then maybe Pera. I don't know anything about them, though.

[Speaker 3]
It's not ringing a bell now. Which house did he say? Do we know that one?

Is that the one that we gave the horn to once?

[Speaker 1]
No, so that was the one you guys interacted with House Kane, which claimed that they were trying to start a war with House Marta.

[Speaker 3]
Ah, that's why it sounds familiar.

[Speaker 1]
You guys have not actually met them before.

[Speaker 3]
So can we do our thing?

[Speaker 1]
What do you have in exchange? What gifts do you bring me?

[Speaker 4]
Can I ask the bow what Amethyst dragons like?

[Speaker 1]
Hmm. Amethyst dragons. Oh, geez.

I don't really have many interactions with them. I would try for a spot of magic. Maybe some gold?

[Speaker 4]
Got it. Thank you.

[Speaker 3]
Don't you start out there.

[Speaker 6]
I was about to talk.

[Speaker 3]
I'm so sorry. I just set off a firework and it scared the shit out of me. There is nothing worth fireworking right now.

You have a month.

[Speaker 6]
You don't know where this dragon is.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Would you like some candy? I have candy. She's going to start going through her purse.

What kind of gift would you like?

[Speaker 1]
Actually, I won't say no to the candy.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. I've got an assortment here. She'll list off some flavors.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent.

[Speaker 4]
You might find this interesting. It's the latest in fey weaponry and I will offer him one of the poppy muskets that I have.

[Speaker 1]
Ooh, I can tinker with this later.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, this will also do.

[Speaker 4]
I know, that's exactly why I picked it up, too.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sure we could arrange for a regular supply of confections if you have the sweet taste for one.

[Speaker 1]
I don't care to explain my associations with you. Just do whatever it is you're going to do with the Ley Crystal and leave. Enjoy this candy.

[Speaker 6]
Of course. Have a very good day. Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go.

[Speaker 1]
The wagon has since been deployed.

[Speaker 2]
Have all the drow fled?

[Speaker 1]
They're still around. He just orders them to, like, leave. Like, go somewhere else so he can eat in private.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, we'll leave you to your own devices, then. Let's go hunting.

[Speaker 3]
Wait, don't we need the crystal that's, like, behind the dragon?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Is it behind the dragon? Oh, okay, then we'll go there.

[Speaker 1]
He, like, moves over to the side so that you guys can get past.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's a dragon in the way.

[Speaker 1]
He looks like a cat eating dry food right now.

[Speaker 2]
It's like the... Oh, I think the drow is still here, but let's... Oh, yeah.

That's not better.

[Speaker 5]
Uh-oh.

[Speaker 2]
I just did not move them. Oh, okay, so they're leaving. Good.

Okay. Alright. Oh, that's pretty.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, I guess Para can drop her thing.

[Speaker 6]
That is pretty.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's not pink now. Well, everyone does their thing.

[Speaker 3]
Alright, and we were setting up a sunshine here, right?

[Speaker 4]
No, we were just coming to charge the part.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, that's correct. I don't think they said anything about that.

[Speaker 3]
Did they tell us how to charge the stuff?

[Speaker 1]
It's just putting them... Yeah, it's literally just bringing them within proximity.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's fair.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Let's go check out the creepy thing.

[Speaker 2]
Do you wish for me to translate?

[Speaker 4]
I mean... Yeah, sure. You can do it for free, can't you?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I can.

[Speaker 4]
Alright, you do it for free. I have to pay for it. Damn subscription.

[Speaker 1]
Is it a plant?

[Speaker 4]
It's plants and animals. Just kind of sitting there.

[Speaker 2]
Well, yeah, I'll probably get close in so I can get them all in. I don't think that comes with me. I don't know if it does.

Oh, I can just talk with them. Oh, I can make all sorts of different trails and stuff. I did not know I could do that.

Alright. So... Hmm.

Nice view that we're having.

[Speaker 1]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 4]
Are we sure that's a plant?

[Speaker 1]
It is, in fact, a plant. What do you say to this thing? Nice view that we're having.

This kind of turns to you, turns away.

[Speaker 2]
One for conversation, I suppose. See if there's anything else here that's more talkative. Talk to this human-looking plant.

Hello. Hmm. What do you want?

Could you tell me what happened to the geodes here? Did they all die? They did, in fact, whereas...

I see. So none of them escaped then. That's unfortunate.

Is there anything else we want to ask them about?

[Speaker 4]
Anything interesting in the area?

[Speaker 2]
Other than the dragon. Yeah, besides the crystal and the dragon, is there anything...

[Speaker 1]
Uh... You all cut out on my end. Can you guys hear me?

Oh, yeah. I can hear you now. Alright, sorry.

What did you say? Um... Is there anything interesting in the area?

[Speaker 2]
Other than that, other than the crystal, was there anything that the druids were protecting?

[Speaker 1]
That the druids were protecting?

[Speaker 2]
No, not to our knowledge. I see. Okay.

Hmm. Is there anything else important in this grove besides the crystal? Nothing that I know of.

I see.

[Speaker 4]
What's the deal with the thingy?

[Speaker 2]
Thingy?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, the plants and animals all grouped together.

[Speaker 2]
I assume it's because the druids are like them.

[Speaker 1]
The dragon's energy has bound us here.

[Speaker 7]
We serve.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I see. Can't do anything about that at the moment, but... We can speak with the king if there's anything we can do.

That is of assuming, of course, you wish to be free. Cutting out still, or am I just not speaking loud enough?

[Speaker 1]
I do need you to say it again.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay. I was just basically ruminating that if they want to be free, we may be able to help them.

[Speaker 1]
No need.

[Speaker 2]
Very well then.

[Speaker 4]
Well, are you saying that because you're not bothered serving the dragon, or because you're a bit depressed and don't care?

[Speaker 1]
This is where I live. These are plants. They're not like sentient creatures.

[Speaker 2]
They're not going to have...

[Speaker 4]
Oh, okay. I thought it was a bit of a dryad or something.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not really sure what he is. It looks like a thorn. Well, that's fine.

I wasn't expecting them to have a whole lot of meat in their plants. Alright, well.

[Speaker 1]
You folks ready to return to the...

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I think we've learned about as much as we're going to learn from the plants.

[Speaker 7]
Alrighty.

[Speaker 2]
Is this a treant though? What? I was just wondering what this big red one over here was.

I thought it was like a treant or something.

[Speaker 1]
Um, kind of. It's another blood blight. Oh, it's blight.

Yeah, it's just quite large.

[Speaker 2]
Alright, let's get all done then. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
Alright, so you folks are going to return to the can. I'm going to call it slightly early tonight because I'm feeling just exhausted. I ran the Lancer game earlier today and...

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Two games in a day is going to be...

[Speaker 1]
I had like no prep time before this one. Yeah. I'm waiting on a call from some folks I worked with in the Philippines.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, right. I've got to remember to put my experience from last session in. That might help.

800p plus 900 exp. That's 1,700. So I assume there's going to be more downtime activity between sessions again?

[Speaker 1]
Correct. Alright, I'm going to see you guys later. I'm going to try to get one of these calls going.

I appreciate you hanging out. Sorry, things were a little slow tonight. I've got to prep more for you next time.

That's fine. I think I have enough. Alright, I shall see you folks later.

[Speaker 3]
Thanks for running.

[Speaker 5]
Thanks for running.

[Speaker 1]
Always.

[Speaker 3]
Peace.
